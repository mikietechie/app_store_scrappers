This technical add-on is designed to connect to a CrowdStrike provided Falcon Data Replicator environment. It leverages the SQS queue to determine if there are available data files to download. Once identified the TA will attempt to download the data file, decompress it and post the data into Splunk.

Benefits of using the FDR SQS based TA

Since there is no data filtering the data is able to be processed faster
The SQS queue is leveraged to track when a message is available for processing so there is no checkpoint that needs to be created in Splunk
Multiple inputs can be configured on the same or different systems with minimal risk of data duplication
Bulk message posting decreases the amount of time the data is processed, increasing posting time

Considerations before using the FDR SQS based TA

There is no ability to filter data, all FDR data will be ingested into Splunk
Once a message has been posted to Splunk's internal API it is removed from the SQS queue and cannot be ingested again
Specific start dates are not configurable

Please note:
The data provided by FDR is not ""real time"" and not recommended for use in alerting use cases. The CrowdStrike Event Streams API is designed to facilitate rapid audit and alert data transfer, the Splunk Add-On for the Event Streams API can be found here: CrowdStrike Falcon Event Streams Technical Add-On
For customers interested collecting the AID Master data from FDR, it's also recommended to review the information that is available via the Falcon Devices API. The CrowdStrike Falcon Devices TA can facilitate ingestion of that data into Splunk and can be found here: CrowdStrike Falcon Devices Technical Add-On
This Technical Add-On provides support for:
Splunk v8+ with Python 3
CrowdStrike Provide FDR S3 and SQS infrastructures
CrowdStrike US based, EU and GovCloud environments
Multiple customer environments

Installation is as standard for a Splunk app
Usage Instructions
1 - After running a search, open the SPL Rehab app
2 - Select a search from the User Searches dashboard. Where possible, please ensure you do so using the REST view (Loaded by default)
3 - You will be taken to the Rehab dashboard within the app the search was originally executed. The search will then be automatically executed for you using the start and end times originally used
Rehab Dashboard Use
On Load
Before any info is displayed on the Rehab dashboard, a control search is executed to generate all the performance figures. Only when this is completed will the dashboard start to show any true sign of activity.
Display Info
The dashboard can be broken into two halves. The top half shows the overall stats such as result count, timechart, and fieldsummary as well as performance stats like EPS, total duration, the Lispy, and command count.
The bottom half focusses around stepping through a search. This starts with a table displaying each search statement. Selecting a row will then display the same stats as is possible for the top half but only for a search executed up to the statement selected. Simply put, it enables you to debug your search.
Techy Stuff
Scripts
There are two custom scripts packaged within the app. These are responsible for breaking out the search into statement-by-statement chunks.
Global Objects
Most of the objects within the app (4/6) need to be globally shared in order to be able to fully utilize the app. The reason for this is to enable the rehab dashboard to run within the app the original search was executed. This is so the dashboard can use knowledge objects shared at app level and therefore provide a replicated environment in which the search was originally executed
Number of Searches
The rehab dashboard has a number of searches built into it in order to function. However its worthwhile bearing in mind that these are all ad-hoc and only a maximum of 6 searches will be executed at any one time due to token suppression. Best practises such as the use of base searches have been used extensively to aid in producing a performant application.
Dashboarding Tricks
A couple of dashboarding tricks have been used to simplify logic behind the scenes. The main one being the use of hidden text fields. For a simpler example of this use, check out this great solution here

The pipeline for new features can be seen in trello here. Communications, feedback and support can be accessed via the #spl-rehab slack channel in splunkusergroups.slack.com. Opportunities to have your say on which features you would like to see will be available in there!

Triggr is a Splunk application that allows you to chain multiple saved searches together, while only scheduling the first search in the chain. This is especially useful when sequential transformations are required for data within lookup tables or KV stores. 
Usage

Click the ""Add Search"" button to add searches into the editor. 
Click and drag the the output of one search node into the input of another to chain searches together. 
Click Save Changes to save your changes and enable chaining of searches.  

Considersations

The first search in the chain must be scheduled in order for any subsequent searches to be dispatched. 
If an error occurs in a search, no subsequent searches in the chain are dispatched.
The graphical editor does not imply any ""AND"" or ""OR"" operations. The connection between search nodes simply implies that after the previous search successfully completes, all subsquent searches will attempt to be dispatched. 
Splunk user permissions apply. A user will not be able to chain searches he/she does not have permissions to edit.

jsonutils provides a pair of commands for extracting fields from json data in _raw. jsonkv is smaller and faster, will use less memory and may work on incomplete or invalid json. jsonkvrecursive will parse the json and create a field for every value, including arrays, but will only work on valid json.
jsonkv
jsonkv uses regular expressions to pull field values from a given json.
Examples:
Given this json:  
{
  ""glossary"": {
    ""title"":""example glossary"",
    ""ID"":""SGML"",
    ""SortAs"":""SGML"",
    ""GlossTerm"":""Standard Generalized Markup Language"",

Introduction
The Slack App Alert Integration TA is meant to integrate with Slack Apps, the new way
of communicating with Slack in favor of the deprecated Incoming Webhooks integration.
The Incoming Webhooks integration allows sending messages to multiple channels which
is highly flexible. A Slack App has to join a channel before it can post messages in it,
but using the correct configuration in combination with this TA, a Slack App can join a
channel if needed and post messages to it with customized bot name and emoji icon.
Prerequisites
An installed Slack App in your Slack Workspace:

Create an App and give it a name, for instance Splunk. The app needs a channel to post to, but this is irrelevant for integrating
with the TA, so choose any channel you like.
Copy the generated Bot User OAuth Token:



Configure the scopes for OAuth & Permissions. Grant the following scopes: channels:join,
channels:read, chat:write, chat:write.customize, groups:read, im:read, incoming-webhook, mpim:read



Install the App (if you're not the workspace owner, you probably have to request an install first).

Installation
Install this TA on your Splunk Search Heads. If you're running a Search Head Cluster, you might
need to add the following line to your server.conf under the [shclustering] stanza on your
Search Heads and restart Splunk:
conf_replication_include.ta_slack_app_alert_integration_settings = true
If you don't do this, it's possible that the secret for the token does not get replicated across your Search Head cluster, and the alert will only work on one Search Head.
Configuration
After installation of the TA, navigate to the Slack App Alert Integration app in Splunk, and under Add-on Settings, paste the Bot User OAuth token in the Token field. The Base URL can be left as default, provided that your Search Heads have access to it. There is no proxy configuration yet in this version of the TA. Click Save.
When the TA is configured, you can create an alert using the new Slack App Alert Integration alert action, by configuring its fields:

Channel: the name of the channel to post messages to (without leading #)
Emoji: optional icon to use (like :exclamation: or :alien:)
Bot username: the name that will be used by the Slack App to post the messages with.
Message: the content to post
Auto-join channel: Either True (default) or False. If true, the App will be automatically added to the channel (only if needed).",Version 1.0.2,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/848dc330-117d-11ec-90bc-3e56d7a2e5ca.png,Utilities,https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,101,0,splunk,0,0,Christiaan van Tienhoven,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/cvtienhoven,"Products: Splunk Enterprise

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1263,2022-01-10,08:02:29 AM,Office Documents Template System (ODTS) for Splunk,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/screenshots/697f7742-6900-11e3-b4de-005056ad5c72.png,"Dec. 22, 2012","Application supports several document formats. By default, documents generated in ODT/ODF format supported by OpenOffice/LibreOffice and Microsoft Office (starting with 2007 sp2 and later). Other supported types are: doc, pdf, rtf, txt. Support for doc, pdf, rtf, txt documents requires local OpenOffice/LibreOffice installation (discussed below). Support for docx/xls/xlsx and others may be provided in future. 
Application was tested on Windows/Linux(*nix) platforms

Using Office Documents Template System for Splunk
The App provides a new command - ""docgen"" used to generate office documents. Command has some trivial arguments (discussed later) and accessible at any app

Case 1 - dump splunk results to new document
Very often you just want to insert splunk results to a new document - in this simple case you just need to add docgen command to the end of splunk command's flow:
Example 1:
index=_internal source=""*metrics.log"" group=""per_sourcetype_thruput"" | head 20 | stats min(eps) avg(eps) max(eps) by series | docgen
docgen's output provides information about file generated and where you could find it. By default it's SPLUNK_HOME\etc\apps\odts_splunk\results foder
Example 2:
Just another simple example:
sourcetype=access* | top clientip | docgen
Example 3:
What if you want generated document to be found in another folder(another than ""results"")? Just use -ofile paremeter:
sourcetype=access* | top clientip | docgen -ofile=d:\temp\out.odt
Generated file could be found in d:\temp folder and has name out_<timestamp>.odt

Case 3 - generate DOC, PDF, RTF, TXT documents(i.e. non-ODT)
App could easily dump splunk results to different types of documents like DOC, PDF, RTF (other than ODT). To be able to do that you have to complete two points:

1) install OpenOffice/LibreOffice locally(make sure python-UNO option is checked) and launch OpenOffice/LibreOffice in server mode

You launch OpenOffice/LibreOffice in server mode by running the command (under Windows):
""_path_to_soffice_\soffice"" -invisible -headless ""-accept=socket,host=localhost,port=2002;urp;""
Under Linux(Unix) it may look like:
soffice -invisible -headless ""-accept=socket,host=localhost,port=2002;urp;""
2002 is a port number that you could change

2) open App's setup page and provide absolute path to OpenOffice python binary and (optionally) port number used.

Path may look like(ex. for Windows): C:\Program Files\OpenOffice.org 3\program\python.exe
That's all, to generate document type you need add this type as an extension with ofile parameter, for ex. for doc:
sourcetype=access* | top clientip | docgen -ofile=my.doc

Case 2 - generate documents based on predefined template
Using this App you have ability to generate really complex office documents and place search results to specified places. You could do this by providing you own predefined templates.
To create your own templates or change existing you have to install OpenOffice/LibreOffice.
You could find some templates inside APP_HOME/templates(SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/odts_splunk/templates) folder:

dump_table_custom.odt - simple template that could be change to suite you needs to dump splunk results as table at some places
TableFields.odt - template used to insert splunk results as table with predefined style and columns 
WithAnImage.odt - template with complex formatting (including images). Splunk results inserted as single values inside nested tables
ForTable.odt - template where splunk results inserted as independent tables
TableSection.odt - template where splunk results not just one table, but table with sections
dump_two_tables.odt - template used to insert several splunk results.

For all those templates you could find sample generated documents inside APP_HOME/results(SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/odts_splunk/results) folder to see how it looks like.
To start preparing you own templates or change existing I recommend you to read following article: 
How to prepare Basic Templates in Appy
The App uses Appy framework internally and all principles of preparing templates in Appy are valid for ODTS. Just remember that in templates you could use ""events"" variable that represents splunk's results from main search flow(provided to docgen command).
Article provided and existing templates(from ""templates"" folder) would be a good starting point for changing or creating new templates.
To use created/changed template provide name of it to -tfile parameter:
Example 1: use docgen with some template (for ex.:TableFields.odt):
index=_internal source=*metrics.log splunk_server=""*"" | eval MB=kb/1024 | search group = per_sourcetype_thruput |stats sum(MB) as sumMB by series, group | docgen -tfile=TableFields.odt
If relative path name is provided to docgen command than we are searching for templates in SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/odts_splunk/templates folder",Version 1.3,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/697e9a70-6900-11e3-b4de-005056ad5c72.png,Utilities,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,819,0,splunk,4,3,Dmitry Tomko,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/splunktechie,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

â¢ Splunk search head system should have 8 GB of RAM and a quad-core CPU to run this app smoothly
â¢ This main app also requires Dell Isilon Add-On for Splunk Enterprise
HOW TO INSTALL
This app should be installed on search head either through UI through ""Manage Apps"" or by extracting zip file into /opt/splunk/etc/apps folder. Plesae restart Splunk server after this installation
Topology and Setting up Splunk Environment

This app has been distributed in two parts.

1) Add-on app, which runs collector scripts and gathers data from Dell Isilon node, does indexing on it and provides indexed data to Main app.
  2) Main app, which receives indexed data from Add-on  app, runs searches on it and builds dashboard using indexed data.


This App can be set up in two ways:
    1) Standalone Mode: Install main app and Add-on app on a single machine.

Here both the app resides on a single machine.
Main app uses the data collected by Add-on app and builds dashboard on it

2) Distributed Environment: Install main app and Add-on app on search head, Only Add-on on forwarder system and indexes.conf file from Add-on bundle on Indexer.


Here also both the apps resides on search head machine, but no need to configure Add-on on search head.


Only Add-on needs to be installed and configured on forwarder system.


On Indexer, you can either put complete Add-on without configuring or just indexes.conf from the Add-on bundle that contains definition for 'isilon' index.


Execute the following command on forwarder to forward the collected data to the indexer.
   /opt/splunk/bin/splunk add forward-server <indexer_ip_address>:9997


On Indexer machine, enable event listening on port 9997 (recommended by Splunk).


Main app on search head uses the received data and builds dashboards on it.

Getting started
This app is not ""visible"" in the Splunk UI app menu. After installing the app, follow this process:
1. Do a search of any data and switch to the visualisation tab
2. In the top left, in the visualisastion menu, select ""Dendrogram viz""
3. Open the ""Format"" menu then select ""Help""
4. There will be a link to the in-app documentation, which includes working examples

Usage
This visualisation expects a table of data with specific field names. There are two main data formats, one with a column called ""path"" or a second format with fields ""child"" and ""parent"". Additional optional columns are listed below.

path - this column/field should be forward-slash delimited, but you can change the delimiter in the formatting options.
parent - this column/field is a unique name for this node's parent. it is optional.
child - this column/field is a unique name for the node.
color - a HTML color code or hex value to use for coloring the node
drilldown -  when a user clicks a node, the contents of this drilldown field will be set in a token called $dendrogram_viz_drilldown$. See token section below.
tooltip - content to show on the tooltip when a user hovers the node
names - can be used to change node names. Should be the same 'depth' as the path.


Here is an example search that you can use with web data
index=web | stats count by uri_path | rename uri_path as path
Here is an example of how the ""path"" data format should look


Here is an example of how the ""child/parent"" data format should look


Tokens
When clicking a node, the following tokens will be set: $dendrogram_viz_path$, $dendrogram_viz_name$, $dendrogram_viz_name$ (see 'names' above) and $dendrogram_viz_drilldown$ (if drilldown column is provided in the data). Hit F12 to open the browser console, to see what tokens are being set.

by Aaron Chandler
Featuring: BrowsingHistoryView v2.46 Â© Nir Sofer www.nirsoft.net/utils/browsing_history_view.html
This add-on is intended for deployment to Windows clients (my thought was workstations, but I suppose Windows servers with a web browser in use could be a data source, too).
A little .bat script will run every hour and obtain the client's internet browsing history in an XML file, which Splunk will then parse using the provided sourcetype.
Please visit the BrowsingHistoryView website to see other command-line options which you could use to tailor this add-on for your specific needs.
Installation:

Place this add-on in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/deployment-apps on your Deployment Server.
Create a $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/deployment-apps/BrowsingHistoryView/local directory.
Copy the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/deployment-apps/BrowsingHistoryView/default/inputs.conf file to your newly-made $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/deployment-apps/BrowsingHistoryView/local.
Modify your newly-pasted inputs.conf file to change any configurations which you'd like to alter; e.g. change the disabled parameters to 1 for the inputs to run.
Deploy the add-on to your Windows clients.
Place the out-of-box add-on (without the modified inputs.conf) in the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps directory on your search head(s) so you can use the provided sourcetype in your searches.
If you're running a full-blown Splunk node on Windows (shudder), you can also place the add-on (with the modified inputs.conf) in that node's $SPLUNK_HOME\etc\apps directory.

This can be handy when you have several MV fields and the use of mvexpand might lose the relationships among them.
The command can do sum, average, min, max, range (max - min), standard deviation, median, and mode.
USAGE
| mvstats <function> <mv-field> as <result-field>

Where:
<function> is one of:
    sum - add up the values in <mv-field>
    ave - compute the average of the values in <mv-field>
    min - return the lowest number in <mv-field>
    max - return the highest number in <mv-field>
    range - return the difference between the highest and lowest values
    stdev - compute the standard deviation of the values in <mv-field>
    median - return the middle value in <mv-field>
    mode - return the most common value in <mv-field>
<mv-field> is a multi-value numeric field
<result-field> is the name of a field to receive the results

Notes:
- If <mv-field> contains a non-numeric value then <result-field> is set to ""NaN"".
- The stdev, median, and mode functions are supported only under Python3.
- The mode function returns ""NaN"" if more than one value has the highest cardinality.
- The mode function accepts non-numeric input.

EXAMPLE:
... | stats values(dest_port) as dest_port, values(count) as count by app
| mvstats sum count as total
PREREQUISITES:
None

Kaspersky CyberTrace App for Splunk provides the following features:
  â¢    Displays information about URLs, IP addresses, and file hashes contained in the events matched in Kaspersky CyberTrace on Splunk dashboards
  â¢    Supports alert templates that include information about trigger conditions.
  â¢    Quick integration of Kaspersky CyberTrace with your Splunk instance
  â¢    On-demand indicator lookup in Kaspersky CyberTrace from your Splunk instance

Note: Kaspersky CyberTrace contains a certificate for the demo version of Kaspersky Threat Data Feeds. These feeds do not require a commercial certificate. Demo feeds provide lower detection rates in comparison with their corresponding commercial versions. To obtain a certificate for the commercial versions of Kaspersky Threat Data Feeds, contact the Kaspersky Cybersecurity Service team (intelligence@kaspersky.com).

Kaspersky CyberTrace key features
Kaspersky CyberTrace allows you to check URLs, file hashes, and IP addresses contained in events that arrive in Splunk. The URLs, file hashes, and IP addresses are checked against threat data feeds from Kaspersky Lab, or feeds from other vendors or sources used by Kaspersky CyberTrace. During the matching process, Kaspersky CyberTrace determines the indicator category and generates an event enriched with actionable context.
Kaspersky CyberTrace key features are:
  â¢    CyberTrace is flexible and can be easily integrated into the existing infrastructure which allows you to avoid the challenges of integrating threat intelligence feeds with Splunk. CyberTrace integrates with any threat intelligence feed you might want to use (threat intelligence feeds from Kaspersky, other vendors, OSINT or your custom feeds) and uses all these feeds together.
â¢    CyberTrace does not reduce the performance of the existing security controls and does not miss detections. The process of parsing and matching of the incoming data happens inside CyberTrace. This reduces the load on the existing SIEM solution. Kaspersky CyberTrace parses the incoming logs and events, matches the resulting data to feeds, and generates its own alerts on threat detection.
â¢    CyberTrace helps to choose the better intelligence sources. CyberTrace helps to evaluate the effectiveness of the integrated threat intelligence feeds by providing detailed statistics on detections and allowing analysts to compare different threat intelligence sources in terms of their relevance to the company. 
â¢    CyberTrace helps to reduce the impact of false positives. By using CyberTrace, analysts can fight false positives by whitelisting certain IoCs and filtering threat intelligence feeds according to configurable filtering rules.

It provides a set of views based on the asset, identity or file/process.  Rather than searching all data for the asset you are looking for, target your investigation on the asset(s) or identity of interest and then pivot to authentication events or network traffic events that are pertinent to the asset(s) or identity under investigation.
Dependencies
URL Toolbox https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2734/ is required for searches to populate a few of the panels within the DNS and Web tabs.
The Alexa (transitioning to the Cisco Umbrella 1M) list is also leveraged but if you are installing with Enterprise Security this will be available.
Enterprise Security is assumed to be installed due to workflow actions and certain drill-downs will take users to Enterprise Security dashboards.
Notes
SA-Investigator does not require population of Asset & Identity Framework to work.  However, if multiple values (IP Address, MAC, NT Hostname, Hostname) for assets are stored within ES, all values will be searched when using the asset investigator.
Release Notes 3.0.0
-Added text/checkbox filters to many tabular panels to filter search results including Endpoint, Authentication, DNS, Web and Certificates
-Added drilldowns to tabular endpoint panels that pivot to the identity investigator when user is clicked on, asset investigator when src or dest is clicked on, file/process investigator when process_exec, process_name or parent_process_exec is clicked on.
-Added parent process panel to file/process dashboard under endpoint with filters for dest and user as well as a pivot on the process_name for better search-ability of spawned processes.
-Added drilldowns to numerous panels that previously didn't with specific cell drilldowns that are called out in the search panel
-Added SSL Certificate detail panels
-Added additional authentication fields to Authentication by User for more context
-Modified file hash search to use Endpoint DM

Release Notes 2.1.2
-Added workflow actions to pivot to file/process and hashes from Incident Review
-Fixed File/Process Artifacts drill down - Endpoint - Application State Process Details
-Fixed Sysmon search in hashes to drill down on EventCode 1
-Fixed Network Traffic by App panel to strip out file paths to enable drill downs
Release Notes 2.1
-Added custom messages on each pane when no results are found so that it is immediately apparent that no data is found.

Release Notes 2.0
-The primary focus of this release was improving speed of search. This version has been tested against 100K assets and 60K user accounts for query performance. The biggest change is the elimination of the subsearches in the panels while retaining the ability to search asset and identity framework values like IP, DNS, NT Hostname and MAC in the case of assets and multiple identities.
-Added new panels and tabs for the Endpoint and Change datamodels (requires CIM 4.12)
-Commented out the Change Analysis and Application State datamodels as they are deprecated with 4.12 - Note that they can be re-enabled if desired.
-Modified identity search to autopopulate escape characters for usernames with a format of domain\username
-Modified the Windows Event Search tab to search specific fields for assets (host,dvc,src and dest) and identity (user) and added the ability to search multiple Windows Event Codes concurrently (comma separated)
-Modified the sourcetype search to search specific fields for assets (host,dvc,src and dest) and identity (user)

-All tablular results should sort oldest to newest
-Added note reminding everyone to use \ as an escape character for domain\user notation
-Fixed drilldowns for multi-asset searches
-Fixed search associated with DNS and Alexa-1M
-Misc drilldown searches were improved and cleaned up
Release Notes 1.2

The Dragos Splunk extensions for Worldview Threat Intelligence are split into two parts.
The Dragos Technology Add-on provides the necessary logic to read and store Worldview IoCs in a Splunk key value store or index.  Splunk users can craft custom queries themselves or leverage the Dragos Worldview Threat Intelligence App.
The Worldview Threat Intelligence App searches log data combining the Dragos IoCs and customer data to leverage the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM). The App presents the results as a series of dashboards that are user-customizable to fit individual needs.
The Splunk Add-on and Threat Intelligence app allow users to search log data collected from both enterprise IT and industrial Operational Technology (OT) networks. This combined view gives users a unified experience when searching their data for IOCs, providing analysts with improved situational awareness and decision-making support.
This expands the ICS cybersecurity ecosystem to ensure critical infrastructure and industrial organizations are equipped with enhanced threat visibility and better analytics, resulting in better protection of their OT environments - regardless of where an adversary may attack. It enables more effective SOC functions - more effective threat hunts, ability to resolve incidents more quickly - for organizations concerned about ICS cybersecurity.",Version 1.1.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/1c79ca18-6e67-11ec-924e-caa71c1c192b.png,"IT Operations, IoT & Industrial Data",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,209,0,splunk,0,0,Dragos Inc,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/dragosinc,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

The Welcome Page Creator for Splunk is not a traditional app. It is a collection of helpful pre-built panels that can be added to a dashboard to help users make the most of Splunk.
This app is simply a showcase of the pre-built panels. Please do not clone these.
Installation Instructions
Splunk Install
Install the Welcome Page Creator on any Search Head in your environment. The Welcome Page Creator should NOT be installed to any Forwarders and Indexers that are not also Search Heads.
Refer to the standard methods for Splunk Add-on installs as documented for a Single Server Install or a Distributed Environment Install.
Configuration Instructions
Please customize the ""Internal Community"" panel. Learn how to properly edit a prebuilt panel so changes are reflected across the deployment. The write permission on your app should be changed so that only admins can edit the app and its Knowledge Objects.
Usage Instructions

Add pre-built panels to your existing dashboards.
Explore panels using the app but edit your dashboards that exist elsewhere.

Workspace Template
Version 3.0.1 includes an app template called ""workspace"". This template accelerates the time to create a new app with a landing Welcome page.
A ""workspace"" is an app that a team or functional group uses to segregate their knowledge objects from other users on the platform.
A ""welcome page"" is a default dashboard within a Splunk users default app that contains welcoming information.
Workspace Installation Instructions
Workspace Template 
The Welcome Page Creator contains a Workspace app template. To take advantage of it, copy the folder path below:
$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/welcome/static/workspace
to 
$SPLUNK_HOME/share/splunk/app_templates/workspace
(Restart not required!)
Workspace Usage Instructions

Create Workspace from Template 
 Select the 'workspace' template while creating a Splunk app.
Customize Created Workspace 
 Navigate to that new Workspace (app). Notice that you were automatically directed to a 'welcome' page. Edit that 'welcome' page as desired by adding from pre-built panels included with this app.

Upgrade
The prebuilt panels of 3.0.0 version and later use a ""welcome_"" preceding naming convention. Upgrading in place will result in duplicate pre-built panels, as the old and newer versions have different file names.
    1. Uninstall app throughout your environment. References to prebuilt panels on existing dashboards will break during this time.
    2. Install version 3.0.0 or newer of the app.
    3. Edit references to the prebuilt panels adding ""welcome_"" to switch to the newer panels. Or in the GUI, delete old panels and add new ones.

Use the power of neo4j over Splunk.
This app allows you to run cypher queries and get the results, all over splunk. This allows you to take advantage of both neo4j's cypher and splunk's SPL.
Project page on github: https://github.com/omerl13/neo4s
Examples
Basic usage:
| neo4j host=""mygraph.com:7474"" query=""MATCH (n)-[r]->(m) RETURN n,r,m"" | table *
Using neo4j authentication:
| neo4j host=""secretgraph.com:7474"" username=""neo4j"" password=""neo4j"" query=""MATCH (n) RETURN n LIMIT 10""
Using bolt protocol:
| neo4j host=""mygraph.com:7687"" scheme=""bolt"" query=""MATCH (n) RETURN n"" | table *
Options

host (required): Hostname + graph port (port is optional, default port is 7474 for HTTP and 7687 for bolt)
query (required): Cypher query to run on the graph (can be of any kind)
username (optional): Username for authentication
password (optional): Password for authentication
scheme (optional): Default to HTTP

Protocol
This app can query neo4j graphs in bolt protocol. The default is HTTP, in order to use bolt, set scheme=""bolt"" and use the bolt port at the end of the host parameter.

In general there are two methods for installing apps into Splunk:

Copy this whole github-modinput folder to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps.
Restart Splunk

or

From the App dropdown menu in your Splunk interface, click on ""Find More Apps""
Search for ""Github Modular Input"" and follow the instructions to install. 

Adding an input

From Splunk Home, click the Settings menu. Under Data, click Data inputs, and find Github Commits, the input you just added. Click Add new on that row.
Click Add new and fill in:
name (whatever name you want to give this input)
owner (the owner of the Github repository, this is a Github username or org name)
repository (the name of the Github repository)
(optional) token if using a private repository and/or to avoid Github's API limits. To get a Github API token visit the Github settings page and make sure the repo and public_repo scopes are selected.


Save your input, and navigate back to Splunk Home.
Do a search for sourcetype=github_commits and you should see some commits indexed, if your repository has a large number of commits indexing them may take a few moments.

Deployment
Single Server Deployment:
In a single server deployment, single instance of Splunk Enterprise functions as data collection node, indexer and search head. In such deployment, install the add-ons Proofpoint Email Security Add-On and Proofpoint TAP SIEM Modular Input. After that, install Proofpoint Email Security App For Splunk.
Distributed Deployment
In a distributed deployment, typically a combination of forwarders are deployed for data collection, separate indexer nodes for data injection and search heads for data visualization are deployed. We recommend installing our TA's on both Forwarder and Search heads and the App on the search head.

Splunk Configuration
Add UDP/TCP input to listen on the port for PPS logs and specify ""pps_log"" as sourcetype. You can do this from Splunk Admin Console.

Go to ""Settings"" -> ""Data Inputs""
Click on ""Add new"" action for TCP or UDP input
Enter port and click on ""Next""
In ""Select sourcetype"" search and select ""pps_log"". Click ""Review"".
Review config and submit to create a data source.
Check data summary and sourcetypes tab to make sure the logs are being accepted for the pps_log sourcetype.

Changing the Index
By default this app uses the ""main"" index to look for Proofpoint logs. To change this to an index that the Proofpoint Email Security Add-On uses, you need to edit the get_pps_index macro. Here are the steps:

Navigate to Settings->Advanced Search and select ""Search macros""
Change the app context to ""Proofpoint Email Security App for Splunk""
Select the macro named ""get_pps_index""
Change index=main to the correct index. Please make sure this index matches the one used the Proofpoint Email Security Add-On for Splunk.
Save the configuration.

Proofpoint Email Protection Configuration
On the Proofpoint Email Protection admin console, enable syslog to forward to your Splunk instance

Login to PPS as an admin user and navigate to âLogs and ReportsÂ >Â Log Settingsâ. Proofpoint on Demand customers please note that this feature requires a separate Remote Syslog license.
Input syslog protocol, host and port numbers
Enable Filter and Mail logs
Click âSave ChangesâÂ 

Verification

PPS filter and mail logs are collected by the source type ""pps_log"" and are mapped to sourcetypes pps_filter_log and pps_mail_log. In the search box you can verify the logs by search for ""sourcetype=""pps_filter_log"" and ""sourcetype=""pps_mail_log""
To view the dashboards from the splunk home page, click on the Proofpoint Email Security App For Splunk icon. This should take you to PPS Summary Dashboard with latest information.

This app provides a visualization that you can use in your own apps and dashboards.
To use it in your dashboards, simply install the app, and create a search that provides the values you want to display.

Usecases for the Network Diagram Visualization:

Displaying current server status based on CPU, Memory, I/O, and Disk usage
Visually associating users with actions, e.g. purchases, crashes, errors
Visualising the connection speeds between two hosts or services
Showing how events are related to eachother

The following fields can be used in the search:
-   from (required): The unique name of the source entity.
-   to (optional): The unique name of the destination entity.
-   value (optional): Text to display as a tool tip. This text is also available as a token when the entity (from) is clicked.
-   type (optional): This is used to display the entity on the dashboard (from). Use the list of icons available, Splunk server icons, or shapes.
-   color (optional): Used to set the color of the text and icon (except for Splunk icons).
-   linktext (optional): Text to display on the link between the from and to entities.
Options can be overwritten, so if type or color is set multiple times in the search results, the last value will be used. This is useful if you wish to set the icon types and values via a lookup table at the end of your search.
Save Layout Designs
You can now save the layout of a Network Diagram Viz to make sure a specific layout is always displayed on your dashboards.
To create a layout, go to the Create Layouts dashboard and follow these steps:

Paste in your search then click Run Search to generate a Network Diagram Viz
Drag the nodes around until you are happy with the design.
A new search is generated in the third panel. Replace your original search with the new search to save your layout.

Note: You must have physics turned off: General > Enable Physics = false
You must also turn off hierarchy settings: Hierarchy > Hierarchy View = false
To prevent users from altering your layout, you can choose to disable draggable nodes: General > Draggable Nodes = false

| fields from, to, value, type

Tokens
Tokens are generated each time you click a node. This can be useful if you want to populate another panel on the dashboard with a custom search, or link to a new dashboard with the tokens carying across.

Node: This is the unique node name (e.g. the server name). Default value: $nd_node_token$
Value: This is the value/tooltip as it was defined in the search results. Default value: $nd_value_token$

I am a Splunk Professional Services consultant working for JDS Australia (https://www.jds.net.au), in Sydney, Australia.
What does this app do?
HunterKiller is a alert action that uses the Splunk REST API to manage search jobs. The alert action reads the list of SIDs in the search results and then sends the specified control command to each search job.
It's designed to fill the gaps where workload management can't reach
Typical Use Cases

Finalizing or cancelling poor search jobs
Moving jobs to specific workload management pools thereby limiting or increasing resource limits
Changing priority of a search job
Extending the life of job results

How does it work
1 - Create a search that returns a list of SIDs that you want you manage. (| rest /services/search/jobs/ | search title=mysearchcritea) The search must return a field called sid
2 - Add the HunterKiller alert action
3 - Select the command you want to send to each job
4 - Save the alert
PS. The alert action only uses the 'sid', 'action' and 'argument' fields. 
| rest /services/search/jobs/ returns many, many fields so use the fields or table commands to narrow down what fields are passed on to the alert action.
Advanced
You can also specify the command and it's arguments within the search results. This allows each row to have a different command. Simply set a field called 'action' that contains a valid control command. Arguments for this command can be supplied by setting the 'argument' field.
A full list of commands can be found at https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/RESTREF/RESTsearch#search.2Fjobs.2F.7Bsearch_id.7D.2Fcontrol

Installation
After downloading the app and going through the set up process, you still need to install either the Symantec 11 Technology Add-on or Symantec 12 Technology Add-on. If you are currently running both products, you should install both TAs. They are included with this app in the appserver/addons directory. For single server Splunk instances, the TAs will be on the same server as the app. For distributed Splunk instances, the TAs just needs to go on the indexers and the app just goes on the search heads.
Configuring the TAs
Data can be received via syslog or by monitoring the SEP log files on the SEP Manager. To receive data over syslog, manually set the sourcetype for the associated data input to either 'sep11:log' or 'sep12:log'. To monitor the files directly, you should install a Splunk Universal Forwarder on your management console. You'll need to set the log file location in the inputs.conf file and enable the associated file inputs. An example inputs.conf file is provided for you in the apps default directory. It's called inputs.conf.local. The default path in inputs.conf assumes that the SEP Manager is installed in C:\Program Files\Symantec\Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager. Edit this path to the actual location of the SEP Manager if necessary.",Version 1.0.3,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/6916ada2-6900-11e3-b4de-005056ad5c72.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance",http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,"5,864",0,splunk,5,7,David Dorsey,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/ddorsey_splunk,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

Usage
... | jwt field=string [secret=string] [filter=(True|False)] [wrap=(True|False)] [debug=(True|False)]

field: Specify the field containing the Base64 encoded JWT token. Will automatically detect standard HTTP Authorization header containing JWT bearer token if present.
secret: If specified, will validate the JWT signature against the provided secret (HMAC SHA-256 only). 
filter: Optionally filter results to only include events which contain the specified field (default: False).
wrap: Returned JSON structure will be wrapped with a ""jwt"" object to automatically export fully-qualified properties (e.g. jwt.header.alg) when passed through spath with no options (default: True).
debug: Set to True to enable errors when decoding events (default: False).

The specified field can either contain only the encoded JWT value, or more commonly, it can be included as a bearer token value in a standard HTTP Authentication header:
Host: www.example.com
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6I....
Content-Type: application/json
The authorization header will automatically be detected and parsed to obtain the JWT value, and both muliline and mulivalue field types are supported.
The resulting JSON representation of the token will then be made available in a jwt field for further analysis, though in many cases it will be most desirable to use the spath command to access the properties directly. Without any additional arguments, simply passing the jwt field as the input to spath will result in fields being created for each property in the JWT token:
| jwt field=""request_headers"" | spath input=jwt
From this output, accessing the JWT values is as simple as referencing jwt.header.alg or jwt.payload.name.
However, more advanced use cases can be easily accomplished with the additional options provided. For example, to show only events which included a JWT token, validate the token's HMAC SHA-256 signature with a provided secret and target the validation result directly, the following query could accomplish this:
| jwt field=""request_headers"" secret=""mySecret"" wrap=false filter=true 
| spath input=jwt path=signature 
| search signature=""Invalid""
Roadmap
As is, this app is functional and tested with standard JWT tokens as described above. If there is interest, support for additional signature algorithms and enhanced functionality may be considered.",Version 1.0.3,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/3b79d746-b800-11eb-8a47-0ade35b64519.png,"Utilities, DevOps",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,265,0,splunk,0,0,Michael Jones,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/IntelliScape,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

It`s built with Splunk Add-on Builder

App 3.0.1
App Build 2 

OVERVIEW
Technology Add-on (TA) for CyberArk  enables current CyberArk customers to ingest data from 3 inputs based on API endpoints CyberArk.

.../pimservices.svc/safes/-         (Data about Safe Members)
.../api/Accounts         -          (Data about accounts)
.../api/recordings      -           (Data about recorded user sessions)

DETAILS:

Creates Index - False
OS: Platform independent
Heavy Forwarder Required

Compatible with: Splunk Enterprise version: 7.1.x, 7.2.x, 7.3.x, 8.0.x, 8.1.x
DEPLOYMENT
1.In order to successfully ingest event data a valid username and password are required. Based on the username and password , an authentication token is generated and used for each API Call.
(DAP issues a short-lived access token after authenticating a requester. The token is valid for 8 minutes by default. The token is a JSON Web Token (JWT). It is cryptographically signed by a DAP private key (RSA 2048), which includes the host or user id along with the expiration timestamp. DAP uses OpenSSL to generate the RSA key pair, validate, and sign the tokens.)
INSTALLATION
Install the Add-on on Heavy Forwarders or Splunk Enterprise Standalone Instance. Downloading the TA package and follow the instructions below:
1.  In the UI navigate to: âManage Appsâ
2.  In the top right corner select âInstall app from fileâ
3.  Select âChoose Fileâ and select the TA package (.spl or .tar)
4.  Select âUploadâ and follow the prompts to restart Splunk.

    The Encrypted Credentials visualization allows you to seamlessly interact with the Encrypted Credentials store within Splunk, right from a simple xml dashboard.

NOTE - THIS IS IMPORTANT
The use of this visualization requires a user to have the encrypted_credentials role, which is a custom role included within the visualization. This role grants the user access to the admin_all_objects capability. This role was separated from the admin role as a way of differentiating who has access to the visualization. 
ONLY ASSIGN THIS ROLE TO THOSE USERS WHOM YOU TRUST WITH ADMIN PRIVILEGES.
Configuration
The Encrypted Credentials visualization has very few options. 


Realm
    The realm setting is an optional field.


Username
    This is the username to be created for the credential set.


Password
    This is the password to be associated with the username being created. Ensure it aligns with the best practices established within your organization.


Debug

JavasScript Logging
yes, no
This controls if debug logging should be enabled for the view.



The Only Search

| makeresults

To use this visualization the | makeresults search must be performed. Once you have results, then select the Encrypted Credentials visualization. That is all to do.

Deploy and maintain Symon through the Splunk Deployment Server.
This will enable you to have all systems running the same version of Sysmon and the same up-to-date configuration.
No more logging in to all servers and installing it manually or having to negociate a GPO change.
When deployed it will check for Sysmon on the system, when it is below the configured version (currently 8.00), it will uninstall that version and install 8.00 with the attached configuration.
Every 12 hours it will check if the config file from the deployment server is newer than the running config. If so, it will update.
All actions of the scripts are logged and indexed into the Windows index as sourcetype InstallLog:Sysmon
Note!
Currently it assumes the app to be named TA-Sysmon-deploy.
It will look for the SplunkForwarder service to be installed and use its install location as a variable in the script.
I also maintain a Sysmon repository to customise your own configuration, mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular
The included config is a complete generated configuration from this repository, you can start from this. 
Usage:
Obviously you are required to have a deployment server and installed Universal Forwarder agents connected to it.
Download the latest Sysmon version from here https://download.sysinternals.com/files/Sysmon.zip, do to the distribution license I am not able to include it. Place sysmon.exe in the bin folder and you're ready to deploy!

One of the biggest operational concerns for IT professionals and Software Defined Data Center (SDDC) administrators is the lack of visibility between the virtual overlay and physical networking layers -- how to trace and troubleshoot connectivity issues. Lacking traceability leads to longer time to resolution, and unacceptable outage time frames for many customers.

NetFlow Logicâs V2P Network Visibility solution provides an easy and scalable way to analyze the massive volumes of network metadata generated by your routers, switches, next generation firewalls, load balancers (Cisco ASA, F5, Palo Alto Networks, etc.) â whether it is from a physical or virtual network, or both. This solution also provides end-to-end operational information about virtual and physical network traffic paths.
This App relies on flow data processed by NetFlow Optimizerâ¢ (NFO). NFO deployment requires no agents. A single instance of NFO, deployed in a data center, is capable of processing and analyzing massive volumes of network metadata.

Configure your all flow-capable exporters, such as ToR switches, core and aggregation switches, routers, and virtual switches, such as VDS or Open vSwicth to send NetFlow/sFlow/IPFIX to NetFlow Optimizer.

This TA gets your Garmin Connect activities and daily user summaries into Splunk. It will retrieve all items initially and once complete, it only does incremental import of new items.
It contains two data inputs:

Garmin - Activities: this will get details for each running/cycling/swimming (and other) activities.
Garmin - Daily Summary: this will get your daily stats, like sleep, resting heart rate, steps etc.

Requirements
This add-on uses Python 3 and will only work on Splunk Enterprise 8.x or newer.
Usage

Configure the relevant data inputs (Settings -> Data Inputs -> Garmin Activities/Daily Summary) with your Garmin Connect username/password.
For activities: select the folder you want to download the activity .fit files to, folder will be created if it doesn't exist. Make sure you have permissions to create the folder.
Select the interval and index for the data. The activity script runs once a day (86400 seconds) by default, the daily summary at 3am in the morning so it can capture the previous day.

Inputs used

This add-on uses the following inputs:
garmin:activities:summary - Contains a summary of the activity, including device and sensor details.
garmin:activities:fit - Contains detailed overview of the activity (e.g GPS coordinates, heart rate, cadence etc.).
garmin:daily - Contains the daily summary (e.g. heart rate, sleep, steps etc.)



Activities can be correlated by using the filename, which is <activity_id>.json for the JSON file and <activity_id>.fit for the FIT file.
Acknowledgements

This TA uses https://github.com/petergardfjall/garminexport for downloading activities from Garmin, with some modifications.
This TA uses https://github.com/dtcooper/python-fitparse for parsing the FIT files.

The HCL BigFix Add-on for Splunk can be used to configure Splunk to ingest BigFix client, relay, and server logs. It also contains multiple modular inputs to query the REST API of a BigFix core server.
Compatability
The HCL BigFix Add-on for Splunk is Python2 and Python3 compatible so it will run on Splunk Enterprise 7.x and 8.x.
Installation
The HCL BigFix Add-on for Splunk should be installed on:

Search Heads - The add-on contains field extractions for flat logs as well as formatting for the REST input for assets
Indexers - The add-on contains props.conf and transforms.conf configurations for properly ingesting logs for BigFix clients, relays, and server logs.
Heavy Forwarder - The modular inputs should be configured on a heavy forwarder to ensure uninterrupted inputs from the BigFix deployment

This app can be distributed using a deployment server but the host responsible for performing modular input queries should have the app installed ad-hoc and to ensure the configurations are not replaced by the deployment server.
Prior to configuring the add-on, below is a list of requirements to request from the BigFix administrator

A console account with the following capabilities:
Show Other Operators' Actions
Can Submit Queries
Can use REST API


The account will need to be subscribed to all sites where information is to be evaluated from.
The account will need to have the proper computer assignments.

Configuration
The add-on has configurations included for ingesting raw BigFix component logs for some sources which are listed in the ""Sourcetypes"" section. The configurations can be found in the ""inputs.template"" file in the default directory of the add-on. Tailor the app for each BigFix component accordingly. Consult the BigFix administrator for where logs will exist and deploy the configurations accordingly.
Configure the account and server information for the BigFix deployment by doing the following:
    - Click ""Configuration"" and add the account username and password provided by the BigFix administrator.    - Click the ""Add-on Settings"" tab and fill in the URL to the BigFix server as well as the port configured for BigFix traffic. The default port is 52311 and is filled in already. Consult your BigFix administrator and ensure this is the proper port.
    - Click the ""Inputs"" tab and click the ""Create New Input"" dropdown to configure the modular REST API inputs.
Sourcetypes
The HCL BigFix Add-on for Splunk uses the following sourcetype format along with the log they currently support:

BigFix Inputs Using Batching
The improve the scalability of the HCL BigFix Add-on for Splunk, the inputs have been rewritten to allow for batch-adding the data. This is done by looping through based on modulation of a specific integer of the results of the relevance query. It basically increments and brings in different results based on however many batches you're looking to run the ingestion on.
The right modulous depends on the size of the environment. Lower client counts means less cardinality of events where you are less likely to have over 100,000 results for a single query using the inputs. As the number of results begins to exponentially grow, your modulous should grow as well. I would recommend that for every 10,000 potential results you have, you increase your modulous by 10.
This means if you are collecting BigFix Action results and an action has gone out to 10,000 machines, your modulous input should use be a batch of 10. Feel free to experiment and I encourage anyone who knows maths way better than me to report back with what would be a good ratio.
BigFix Clients Input
The HCL BigFix Add-on for Splunk contains a configurable REST input for collecting client information from a BigFix deployment. The REST query should return results, even from environments with a large number of clients, in a reasonable amount of time. This requires the coordination with the administrator of BigFix because the field containing the MAC address is not a default property inside of an out-of-the-box BigFix deployment.
Some notes on further requirements for this input:
    - A property the BigFix administrator knows will need to be identified which details a list of MAC addresses for each host. This property will need to be configured with the input. If there is a not a currently configured property, the BigFix administrator may use the relevance below to evaluate the property.
    - The account used to perform the query will need permission to, at least, read the site that contains the property for the MAC address if it's not contained within the Master Action Site.
    - The query relies on results from analysis within the ""BES Support"" site. The user account will need to be assigned to the site to view those results.
If the MAC addresses of the clients are not being evaluated, you can use the following relevance to collect the MAC addresses of most systems that BigFix supports
if windows of operating system then concatenation ""|"" of (mac addresses of adapters of network) else if not windows of operating system then concatenation ""|"" of ((mac address of it as string) of ip interfaces whose (not loopback of it AND exists mac address of it) of network) else """"
Once the property is configured in BigFix, you can configure the property name when you configure the input.
BigFix Analysis Input
The HCL BigFix Add-on for Splunk contains a configurable REST input for ingesting the results of a specificed analysis within BigFix. This will require the display name of the analysis being imported. Once congfigured, the results are ingested per property result per host in a single event so multiple properties within a single analysis can be identified and evaluated once the events are ingested. This will also break multi-value results into their own events with the same property name.
To configure a specific analysis for ingestion, your BigFix administrator will need to provide the integer ID of the analysis as well as the site that analysis exists under. Once you configure those values, your analysis will be ingested.
Another consideration when configuring this input is how often the analysis property is updated. If any analysis property is normally only evaluated on the endpoints once a day, the interval for the ingestion of that analysis should be no less than ""86400"" (24 hours in seconds). Consult your BigFix administrator for evaluation times of analysis that you want to import to ensure your ingestion interval is as long or longer than the analysis interval.

Login PI is an advanced performance measuring system that employs virtual users to monitor your end-usersâ actual digital experience. But unlike real-user / synthetic monitoring, Login PIâs virtual users simulate real end-user desktop tasksâin a consistent and measurable fashionâproviding you with an accurate picture of desktop performance without affecting end-user productivity.
You can now gain access to this data programmatically. Our secure API lets you integrate Login PIâs virtual user data into other popular third-party tools, such as Splunk, where it can be tracked and analyzedâultimately providing you with predictive digital user experience analytics. 
There are lots of ways you can use our API, for example: 
â¢    Login PI data could be fed to a Splunk Predictive Analytics dashboard where it could drive insight into future VDI capacity planning needs
â¢   Login PI alerts could automatically generate helpdesk trouble tickets before end-users even notice thereâs a problem
â¢   Write an Excel macro that calls on our API to return a set of performance results to create charts and graphs for BI reporting

(PFAs).
Events are categorized by source, type of device that generated the events, and
whether service is required.
Auditing for security changes that occur in the resource managers (such as
XClarity Administrator).
Security events can help identify whether unauthorized personnel are attempting
to access your computing resources. This might include events showing that new
users have been added/deleted, what IP addresses users are using to access the
XClarity Orchestrator, the time and dates when they are accessing resources, and
any changes to the security settings of the XClarity Orchestrator (including user

User Guide
Configure Code42 App For Splunk

Install the App according to your environment (see steps above)
Navigate to App > IA-Code42ForSplunk > Administration > Application Configuration

Application Configuration Dashboard
To configure the Code42 application you should start on the Application Configuration page (Administration > Application Configuration)*[]:
Application Configuration
On this screen you can set the base index as well as a flag that specifies that the application is configured. In the future there will be additional configurations available.
Proxy Configuration
If you have configured a proxy server you can view the configuration under this tab. These are proxy server configurations that are being used by existing modular inputs for the Code42 application. You can also delete existing proxy configurations on this tab.
Encrypted Credentials
You can view/delete existing credentials on this tab. These are credentials that are being used by existing modular inputs in the Code42 application. These credentials are the credentials used to connect to Code42 appliances.
Code42
On this screen you can view and make any changes to existing modular inputs. As you make changes and tab between fields the modular input is modified.
Creating New Proxy Configurations
If you need to use a proxy as part of the connection to the Code42 appliance configure it here.


To create a new proxy server configuration, click the Create New Proxy button and fill in the following fields:

Proxy Name: Name for the proxy configuration. This name will be used as the proxy name in the modular input configuration.
Host: Proxy host name or IP.
Port: Port used to connect to the proxy server.
Username: Username used to connect to the proxy server.
Password: Password for the username specified above.
Use SSL: Should SSL be used for the proxy configuration?



Creating New Credentials
By default creating a new modular input with a username and password specified will create the necessary encrypted credentials. However if you want to create encrypted credentials manually follow this process:

To create a new encrypted credential, click the Create New Credential button and fill in with the appropriate username and password.
The realm is the application name where the encrypted credential is created + the username.

NOTE: By default creating a new modular input will automatically create a new encrypted credential so this process is not necessary unless you need a new credential for another purpose.
Creating New Code42 Inputs
NOTE: You will need to configure a new modular input for each appliance

To create a new data input, click the Create New Modular Input button and fill in the following fields. Those with a red asterisk on the screen are required.
Modular Input Name: Name for the data input configuration.
Hostname and port: The hostname or IP address and port of the Code42 appliance. By default you can specify hostname:443.
Username: The username used to connect to the appliance. This user should have a of role of Security Center User, Customer Cloud Admin, or Server Admin.
Password: The password for the previously specified username.
Toggle all data keys: Check to select all data keys.
Data keys: List of endpoints available on the Code42 appliance. Check the data key if you wish to pull event data.
Historical Lookback: This is the number of days to lookback for Security Events. Default is 60.
Interval: The number of seconds indicate how often the input will poll for new data. This setting must be at least 60.
Index: This sets the index for data to be written to. This setting should be changed from default, which normally writes to the main index, to a specified index for best performance.
Use Proxy: Indicates if a proxy should be use for communication with the Code42 appliance.
Proxy Name: Enter the name of the proxy stanza to use with the input.


After creating the modular input you may need to disable/re-enable the input in Settings > Data Inputs > Code42 App For Splunk to activate the input.

NOTE: When configuring the modular input through the Application Configuration dashboard, the password is automatically encrypted into the credential store. If you need to change the credential, create a new credential, and reference the host/user pair in the modular input configuration. An encrypted credential is required for this Splunk App.
Indexes
By default all events will be written to the main index. You should change the index in the configuration files to match your specific index.
Troubleshoot Code42 App For Splunk

Check the Monitoring Console (>=v6.5) for errors
Visit the Application Health dashboard

Full Data Reset
If you experiencing issues, and would like to reset the Code42 Data to factory install, there are few steps to take.

Disable the input.
Clear the indexed data. This is covered in the Splunk documentation
Clear the KVStore that is tracking the cursors using the search |`code42_zero_cursors`

What does this app do?
Enables an alert action that can send customised HTTP/REST requests to an endpoint. You can use search results from the alert to populate all the core fields of of the request including endpoint, headers, query string parameters and payload.
How does it work
After creating an alert, add the HTTP Alert Action at the bottom of the dialog. From there populate the fields as required. 
Version (8.1.0)
The addon now uses Splunk's internal token replacement.
This provides a couple of benefits
 More tokens are available - see docs link below
 Switch to $$ instead of {} allows JSON payloads to be supported.
Please see https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Alert/EmailNotificationTokens for more detail.
N.B. Custom Headers is a special field, as before each header should be separated using a '&'
eg. Header1=value1&Header2=value2
Version (<8.1.0)
For most of the fields you can parameterise data by enclosing the fields in {field_name}. Additional fields are seperated by &
For example, you could set a custom header with the following X-Forwarded-For={host}&Authorization=Splunk {token}
The fields you specify must exist exactly as named in the search results or substitution will be skipped for that section. ie If you have a payload of data={ThisFieldDoesNotExist} and querystring of param={ThisFieldDoesExist} then payload won't do substituion but querystring will.

This cloud billing app is designed to give insights into your spending with cloud services. It allows you to see which services are costing money unnecessarily across AWS, Azure and Google Cloud environments.
It is important to note that this app will work for ANY combination of the previously mentioned Cloud Environments set up. ALL of them are optional. If you do not have all of these Cloud environments, only follow the instructions for the specific cloud environment(s) that you have.
Prerequisites
1. Install the Splunk AWS TA from Splunkbase ensuring that the following sourcetypes are populated correctly and being sent to an appropriate index:
aws:description
aws:cloudwatch
aws:billing



Install and configure the following Azure TA's. Do not change the default sourcetypes utilised by these TA's.
Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/
Microsoft Azure Billing and Usage Add-on for Splunk: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4109/
Microsoft Azure Billing Add-on for Splunk: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4103/


3.
Install and configure the Splunk Add-on for Google Cloud Platform from Splunkbase.
Configuration in GCP is imperative to get the TA working appropriately. Info on configuring a Service Account can be found here.
In order to populate this app fully, all three of the input types will need to be utilized. Billing Data, CPU data and asset inventory data are all required.
First configure your billing data. On your GCP project, create a service account and create a key. Give it access to read buckets. Create a bucket in Storage. Navigate to Billing->Billing Export. Click File Export. Set Bucket name to the one that you just created. Set a report prefix and format type (either will do). Then, in the GCP TA, configure the credentials for the service account that you created with read access to the bucket and set the report prefix.
Next configure your cpu data monitoring. Using a service account that has the correct read access, configure the Cloud monitoring input in the Google Cloud TA with the monitoring metric ""compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/utilization""
Finally, we will set up the asset inventory data onboarding. Unfortunately, there is at present no default way to onboard this data, so we have to create a publish/subscription service to send the data to Splunk. Detailed information on how to do this can be found in the README of this app and below.

INFO FOR SETTING UP ASSET INVENTORY ONBOARDING IN GOOGLE CLOUD:
Due to the way that GCP stores and allows the publication of data  with service accounts, this Process must be repeated in each Project that you want to be monitored in the Splunk Multicloud Billing App.
Create a service account eg asset-inventory-svc-account@operating-ally-123456.iam.gserviceaccount.com
Create a key
Give it access to : Cloud Asset Viewer,  Cloud Asset Feeds Create, Cloud Asset Assets Export Resource, Storage Object Creator, Pub/Sub Publisher

Create a storage bucket
Name the bucket (e.g. gs://asset-inventory-bucket)
Set lifecycle on objects in bucket
Set age of object
Set action to delete

Create a Pub/Sub Topic
Topic Name contains the project id and topic id: e.g. project/operating-ally-123456/topics/asset-inventory-topic

Create a Pub/Sub Subscription
This will be the Link to Splunk

Create a streaming Dataflow -> storage to pubsub
Create a job from template
Name the Job
Choose the Dataflow Template - Text Files on Cloud Storage to Cloud Pub/Sub
Input Cloud Storage File(s) - name the storage bucket that you created earlier and specify a pattern for objects created (eg. gs://asset-inventory-bucket/asset-list-.json)
Choose the Ouput Pub/Sub Topic - name the pub sub topic you created earlier (eg. project/operating-ally-123456/topics/asset-inventory-topic)

Create a micro instance (make sure it is free tier to not ensue costs)

Associate Service Account to VM
take service account private key json and store on vm
Activate service account on vm
        gcloud auth activate-service-account asset-inventory-svc-account@operating-ally-123456.iam.gserviceaccount.com --key-file=key.json

Write a bash script that creates buckets in the storage with asset inventory snapshot

$ cat get-asset-inventory.sh
!/bin/bash
datetime=$(date ""+%F-%T"")
for project in $(gcloud projects list --format=""value(project_id)"" --quiet)
do
gcloud asset export --content-type resource --project $project --output-path ""gs://asset-inventory-bucket/asset-list-$project-$datetime.json""
done


Set up a cron job to run the script
crontab -e
        0 *  *  /directory/to/script/get-asset-inventory.sh
This example returns the asset inventory every hour

(OPTIONAL) Enable Monitoring Asset Changes - This means that any updates to your environment are picked up immediately. All assets are registered at an interval set by you in the crontab above.
https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/monitoring-asset-changes
gcloud asset feeds create asset-inventory-feed --project=operating-ally-123456 --content-type=resource --asset-types=""compute.googleapis.com/Disk"",""compute.googleapis.com/Instance"",""compute.googleapis.com/Address"",\
""compute.googleapis.com/RegionDisk"" --pubsub-topic=""project/operating-ally-123456/topics/asset-inventory-topic""
Configure Splunk GCP TA inputs to use the Cloud Pub/Sub Service monitoring the correct Subscription

Splunk Enterprise data analytics help organizations leverage the data that their infrastructure and security tools provide to understand their security posture, pinpoint and investigate risks, and create alerts and reports. Security operations teams must also rapidly respond to any identified threats, violations and attacks in a prioritized manner. Any delay in response can result in significant security risks. The integrated combination of the Forescout platformâs continuous, agentless device visibility, network access control, dynamic segmentation and workflow orchestration capabilities with Splunk Enterpriseâs data mining and Splunk Enterprise Security (ES)'s security information and event monitoring (SIEM) capabilities provides a solution that maximizes insight, dramatically reduces risk and increases operational efficiency.  
Security blind spots are removed by having Splunk easily consume comprehensive information from Forescout such as:
â¢    Real-time inventory of all network connected virtual and physical devices across IT, BYOD, Guest, IoT and Operational Technology (OT), including new devices with an IPv6 address. Device data can also be sent without dependency on IP address for reporting flexibility. 
â¢    Endpoint information, such as device type, classification, network connection, operating system, applications, users, peripherals and much much more
â¢   More accurate user and location context by resolving overlapping IP addresses and layering tenant ID with IP address in meta data
â¢    Device security posture and compliance gaps
â¢   Authentication, access, tenant ID and network location information
â¢   Threat indicators on devices detected by vulnerability scanning
Use Cases
Capitalizing on Forescout's rich contextual information and policy-driven actions together with Splunk helps you tackle the following use cases.
Rapid anomaly detection and accurate trend analysis
Forescout discovers, classifies and assesses all connected devices; compiles this information in the Splunk CIM format and shares it with Splunk. The additional device information from Forescout includes user information, device type, device configuration, network access patterns over time, network location and security posture. Splunk correlates rich contextual data from Forescout with other data sources and uses this information for long-term storage, swift anomaly detection and accurate trend analysis.
Enhanced incident correlation and prioritization
Splunk correlates rich device context from the Forescout platform with other data sources to better identify and prioritize incidents. When Splunk receives alerts from other data sources about a suspicious activity on a device, it shares the information with Forescout. Forescout provides high-value user, network and device context to Splunk. Splunk leverages this additional insight to determine if a suspicious event is actually malicious or violates policy and escalates or reduces the severity of the event based on the device and user context, such as highly privileged or less trusted users.
Automated closed-loop incident response
Forescout scans all connected devices for indicators of compromise (IOCs) and policy violations in real time when alerted by Splunk. Through Splunkâs Adaptive Operations Framework, Splunk operators can initiate Forescout actionsâsuch as isolating or quarantining potentially compromised or noncompliant endpoints depending on the severity of the violation. Forescout can also dynamically trigger policy-based mitigation and response actions until the deviant device is remediated. Forescout then delivers the results back to Splunk to close the loop. Administrators can view the entire lifecycle and final outcome of the event in the Splunk dashboard.
Architecture Overview

Forescout integration with Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud and Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) is enabled by the 
Forescout eyeExtend for Splunk module paired with the Forescout App for Splunk along with the Forescout Adaptive Response and Forescout Technology Add-ons for Splunk.   
The Forescout App for Splunk provides customizable, out-of-the-box queries and dashboards to visualize Forescout data in Splunk, displaying a wealth of information such as:
â¢ Device compliance status
â¢ User types (registered corporate users or guests)
â¢ Device types connected to the network and connection details
â¢ Patterns of network access over time
â¢ Policy trends
â¢ Forescout system health information
â¢ Incident response action status
The Forescout Technology Add-on for Splunk is a required component to streamline data transfer between Forescout and Splunk Enterprise. This Add-on maps Forescout collected device properties to the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) and extracts events based on Forescout data. The Forescout Technology Add-on also maintains Forescout credentials for communications between Forescout and Splunk Enterprise. 
Support for Splunk Adaptive Operations Framework with The Forescout Adaptive Response Add-on

Splunk's Adaptive Operations Framework describes a complete action flow, which includes requesting an action be applied to an endpoint device and tracking the status of the action taken. 
This integration supports the Splunk Adaptive Operations workflow as follows:
-The Forescout App for Splunk maintains a list of available actions from the Forescout platform. Splunk can instruct the Forescout platform to respond to potential threats by applying any of these actions to endpoints that match search/trend criteria.
-To complete the action flow, the Forescout platform reports the status of actions applied to endpoints.
These closed-loop incident response workflows allow you to streamline security operations and minimize business risk by automating the incident management lifecycle with a complete audit trail that also helps with policy refinements.

Introduction
The QuoLab Add-On for Splunk adds custom search command and data ingestion capabilities your Splunk environment.   The quolabquery generating command allows authorized users to make requests to one or more QuoLab servers to bring in data to Splunk for additional forensic and analytic investigation.  The quolab_timeline modular input can be used to stream activity data into Splunk in real time.
Prerequisites

Splunk
a QuoLab server

Architecture
This add-on comprises an authentication lookup and a python script that implements quolabquery, a generating command and the quolab_timeline modular input.

quolabquery wraps and simplifies requests to the QuoLab REST API. Requests will be sent through web hooks to the same url as the user interface.
quolab_timeline uses a websocket to subscribe to Timeline activity events so they are immediately available as a Splunk indexed event.

Installation
Steps:

Install the app on your search head or standalone Splunk instance using the normal process.
     If you need additional help, please refer to Splunk's docs: About installing Splunk add-ons.
Configure app via UI (as an admin).
     The add on will automatically direct you to the setup page the first time you load it from the Splunk web interface.
     Here you will be prompted to configure a QuoLab server.
Configure one or more QuoLab servers.
     If only a single QuoLab server exists in your environment, name the server quolab to simplify your usage later.
     Add as many servers as you need, now or later.
Confirm that a quolab server is setup correctly by running the quolabquery search to test for a response.
     For example, run the search | quolabquery type=ip-address id=""8.8.8.8"".
     If you created more than one server or named it something other than ""quolab"", you can test it by running | quolabquery server=MY-SERVER-NAME type=ip-address id=""8.8.8.8""
Grant authorization to users who should be allow to run quolabquery.
     Either add users directly to the quolab_servers_user role, or inherit that roles from role(s) that already exist within your organization.
     Members of the admin role will be able to run this automatically.
Setup a new input for each timeline you wish to monitor.
     You will need to capture the timeline ID and choose to enable backfill, and optionally setup 'facets' to include.
     Use the Timeline Status dashboard to review ingestion activity.

Use cases
QuoLab users looking to further enrich their investigations can now bring QuoLab artifacts into Splunk to leverage Splunk's ecosystem and analytics.  This section focuses on interactive queries using custom search commands.  See Combining QuoLab with Splunk below for expanded examples.
Find a specific domain
| quolabquery type=domain id=google.com
Find facets associated with multiple cases
| quolabquery type=case facets=""display,tagged"" limit=30
Find cases where a specific IP address was targeted
| quolabquery query=""{'class': 'sysref', 'type': 'encases', 'target': {'id': '1.2.3.4', 'class': 'fact', 'type': 'ip-address'}}""

This add-on creates a new collection of entities called quolab_servers.
At least one server must be defined to use the custom SPL command.
Each server contains the following attributes:



Attribute
Type
Description




url
URL
The server name and port where QuoLab API requests will be sent


username
String
Name of the QuoLab user account, or <TOKEN> if using token-based authentication


secret
Password  or Token
The password associated with the given username or a token


verify
Boolean
The QuoLab HTTPS listener using a publicly signed certificate. Please understand the security implications of settings this to false.  This should never be false if your QuoLab server is accessed on a public internet connection.


max_batch_size
Integer
The maximum number of results that can be fetched in a single query to the API. If more events are requested at search time then multiple queries will be sent to the API using the supported pagination technique.


max_execution_time
Integer
The longest duration in seconds that any individual query may last.



Modular input: QuoLab Timeline
The quolab_timeline input captures activity from a timeline and sends those events to a Splunk index for later retrieval and analysis.  Before setting up this input, at least one QuoLab Server must be defined, as noted in the prior section.
Steps:

In the Splunk UI, navigate the main menu.  Pick Settings -> Data input.
Under the Local input section, locate QuoLab Timeline and click + Add new.
Select a name for the input, specify the quolab server name, and provide the ID of the timeline to monitor.  (See the notes below on how to determining the ID of an existing timeline from the QuoLab web interface.)
Choose to enable backfill, unless only new events are desireable.
Pick one or more facets that should be used to augment events loaded from the QuoLab database.
Use the Timeline Status dashboard to review ingestion activity.

Finding the Timeline's ID
The ""Timeline"" parameter of the QuoLab Timeline input requires the ID of the timeline, and not a human friendly label.
A timeline's internal identifier can be located via the user interface:

Navigate to the desired timeline in the User Interface.
From the context menu, select Copy -> Fact to Clipboard.
Open a new tab and select Artifact Details from the the Tool picker window.
From the clipboard tray, drag the timeline object to the Artifact Details tool.
Under the Details tab, a object tree will display the underling information.
Copy the ""Id"" value for use in the Timeline input parameter.

Alternately, technical users can also get this identifier via the API directly.  Navigate to /v1/timeline from your browser and get a JSON listing of timelines that your user account has access to.  Look for the hex value associated with the id attribute, and use that as the Timeline parameter.
Search command: quolabquery
The quolabquery command supports simple and advanced queries against a QuoLab catalog.
In simple mode, a user can specify just the type of object to query and optionally specify one or more specific ids to search for.
In advanced mode you can specify a query in JSON mode so the full power of the QuoLab query language is at your disposal.
Simple Usage:
| quolabquery [server=<server>] type=<quolab-type> [id=<list>]
Advanced Usage:
| quolabquery [server=<server>] query=""<json-query>""
Parameters:

type=<type>:  For simple searches, provide one of the QuoLab catalog types here.
    For example: case, endpoint, or ip-address.
    The quolabquery command will determine the correct class associated with each type.
id=<value>: For simple searches, this can be used to specify one or more values (ids) to search for.
    To search for multiple ids, simply enclose the id in double quotes and separate them with a comma.
query=<json-query>: In advanced mode, a custom query can be provided in JSON mode.
    To avoid escaping double quotes, the quolabquery command accepts a JSON-like syntax that uses single quotes as shown in some of the examples later.
    The query can be top-level query (one that explicitly provides it's own query key), or a simpler query where it's assumed that the entire JSON body is the child of the query key.  (If none of that made sense to you, start with the simple query.)

Optional parameters:

server=<quolab-server>: Use this to determine which backend QuoLab server to query.
    If not provided, the default server name is quolab.
limit=<int>:  Restrict the number of query results.
facets=<facet>: Facets are related data to be fetched and returned along with the primary data.
    To retrieve multiple facets at once, provide a comma separated list in double quotes.
order=[-+]<field>: Return results based on field ordering.
    The field name should be provided in dot-notation.
    Precede the field name with a + to sort in ascending order and - to sort in descending order.
    To sort by multiple fields, use a comma separated list surrounded by double quotes.

Example searches:

| quolabquery server=quolab type=wallet
| quolabquery type=ip-address id=""8.8.8.8, 1.2.3.4""
| quolabquery type=endpoint id=tlsh:tlsh=virtual facets=display
| quolabquery query=""{'query':{'class': 'sysfact', 'type': 'case' },'limit': 15, 'facets': {'display': 1,'tagged': true}}""
| quolabquery query=""[{'class': 'sysfact', 'type': 'endpoint'}, {'class': 'sysfact', 'type': 'connector'}]"" limit=100
| quolabquery query=""{'class': 'sysfact', 'type': 'endpoint'}"" limit=100 facets=""refcount,display""

HINT: If you're trying to learn the query language, you can use the quolabquery command with a simple query, and view the actual JSON query sent to QuoLab at the top of Splunk's Job Inspector.

Users with this role can execute the quolabquery command.



Configuration files
This add-on creates a custom configuration file named quolab_servers.conf.
For security reasons, the secret for each server is stored securely in passwords.conf and is encrypted at rest.
Typically there is no reason to modify these files directly.
Combining QuoLab with Splunk
The real power of the quolabquery command is that it can be combined with other Splunk search commands.  We'd love to expand this section to showcase real-life use cases.  Please reach out with with your success stories.  In the meantime, here are some ideas to get you started:
Capturing Tor descriptors to a lookup using 'outputlookup'
Combining the quolabquery command with outputlookup allows you to overwrite or append an existing lookup table within Splunk.
| quolabquery limit=5000 type=known-as facets=refcount | search fact.type=""tor-descriptor""
| rename fact.* as * | table id type label refcount.*
| outputlookup quolab_tor_descriptor.csv
Search for firewall events related to QuoLab cases with a subsearch
This technique uses Splunk's subsearch feature to insert specific fields returned by quolabquery command into a dynamic search.  In this example, Splunk looks in the firewall index for ip addresses in the src_ip field.
index=firewall [
    | quolabquery query=""{'class': 'sysref', 'type': 'encases', 'target': {'class': 'fact', 'type': 'ip-address'}}"" facets=""display""
    | return 1000 src_ip=target.display.label ]
| table _time, sourcetype, src_ip, src_port, dest_ip, dest_port, action
The final search Splunk executes will look like:
index=firewall (src_ip=""1.2.3.4"") OR (src_ip=""99.99.99.99"") OR ...
| table _time, sourcetype, src_ip, src_port, dest_ip, dest_port, action
Check the QuoLab catalog for cases involving threats known to Splunk
This search uses Splunk's map command to launch the quolabquery command using a template search.  Here is an example where a threat ip address (the src_ip field in Splunk) is used to check for cases containing that IP address in QuoLab.
index=threat | top 10 src_ip
| map search=""| quolabquery query=\""{'class': 'sysref', 'type': 'encases', 'target': {'class': 'fact', 'type': 'ip-address', 'id': '$src_ip$'}}\"" facets=display""
| eval _time='document.created-at'
| table _time source.type source.display.label target.display.label document.created-by
Be aware that there are many limitations to the use of the Splunk map command.  This approach is not very efficient or scalable, it requires escaping the search string, and any src_ip on the input that doesn't match in the QuoLab catalog is dropped from the output.  These are all standard limitations of map.  If augmenting Splunk data with QuoLab catalog data is a important use case for you, please contact us.  A future lookup-like search command has been considered, and hearing from you will help with prioritizing new features.
Collect recent QuoLab cases in a Splunk index
The QuoLab Add-On for Splunk doesn't natively support sending QuoLab catalog data into a Splunk index, but this can be done easily using a summary index technique.  Here is an example that will find any cases updated within the last day and send selected fields to a summary index for later searches in Splunk.
| quolabquery type=case limit=1000
| where 'document.updated-at' > relative_time(now(), ""-1d@d"")
| table class, type, id, document.type, document.name, document.priority, document.created-by, document.created-at, document.updated-at, document.created-by
| eval _time='document.updated-at'
| collect index=summary source=quolab-cases
This data can then be searched in Splunk by running the query:
index=summary source=quolab-cases
If this is a use case you find yourself using frequently, please reach out.  There are several inherent limitations of this approach and gotchas with summary indexing, especially around timing.  Let us know if natively supporting this would be a valuable feature.
Troubleshooting
Timeline modular input
Internal/script errors:
index=_internal (source=*quolab_timeline*.log) OR (sourcetype=splunkd ExecProcessor ""message from"" quolab_timeline.py) OR (component=ModularInputs quolab_timeline)
Review all modular input logs:
index=_internal sourcetype=quolab:modinput:timeline | transaction host process_id
Search to show indexing lag:  (Delay is shown in hours).  You should be able to compare the backfilled events vs live events with this chart:
sourcetype=""quolab:timeline"" | eval index_delay = (_indextime-_time)/3600 | timechart avg(index_delay)
Known issues & Limitations
For the most recent list of issues, please check for open issues on the GitHub issues page.
Quolab Timeline (Modular Input)

Backfill json errors may occur for busy timelines.  This is possibly caused by the use of requests and websocket client at the same time.  The websocket client may be replaced with a different library after Python 2.7 support is dropped (which is still required for Splunk 7.3).
The long-running modular input has logging concurrency issues when multiple timelines are configured at once.  This issues is inherent to Python's built in logging handlers and is a bigger issue on Windows due to file locking behavior.  This issues is not unique to this add on, but has been listed here for full transparency.

Introduction
This input provides a mechanism to create, update, and delete event streams in Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Endpoints via the API and index them in your SplunkÂ® instance to make them searchable. All you need to do is provide your API host and credentials from your AMP for Endpoints account and specify the stream parameters (like events or which event types and groups should be directed to this stream).
This app was tested on Splunk v8.1
Prerequisites
It is expected that a user of this app:

is familiar with Cisco AMP for Endpoints and understands the concepts of AMP business, events, event types, and groups.
has an account within a working instance of the cloud hosted version of AMP for Endpoints Console. At this point, there is no support for private cloud AMP for endpoint appliances
has a set of Read/Write AMP API credentials.
knows how to access the event types and groups API endpoints in order to retrieve the codes of event types and guids of groups.

Architecture
This app comes with a custom interface to ensure that every meaningful action (like creating, editing, or deleting an input)
yields expected results.
Please note: This app interacts with a third-party service, namely, Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Endpoints.
This app also uses Splunkâs built-in key-value store for persisting crucial information about event streams.
Installation
This app can be installed directly from Splunkbase. The app will appear in your Splunk Apps navigation bar after it is
successfully installed. When you visit one of the app pages, it will ask you to provide settings on the configuration page.
The configuration contains options related to authenticating to the AMP server by API calls, specifically:

API host (Web address of the Cisco AMP for Endpoints API found in the AMP for Endpoints API documentation)
API id (3rd Party API Client ID provided by AMP for Endpoints. The credentials must allow read and write access.)
API key (API secret key that corresponds to the API id above.)

Once these have been configured you are ready to create and use the inputs.
Use cases
Creating an input
You need to create the input to have the events flow into your index. To do this, go to the app interface and navigate to
âNew Inputâ. If your app is properly configured, you can populate the fields:

'Name' should contain the Input name. The Name must be unique and cannot be changed later. If you attempt to create an input with the Name of an input that already exists, the validation will fail.
'Index' contains the Splunk index the events will be directed to. It defaults to 'main', however you can specify any index within your instance. The index cannot be changed after the input is saved.
'Stream name' should contain the unique name of an event stream. Since event streams can be created not only from Splunk app, but also via the API interface, this name serves a purpose of distinguishing the streams.
'Event Types' allows you to select one or more event types to direct to the stream. You can only select event types that are accessible by your business. Leave this field blank to return all event types.
'Groups' allows you to select one or more connector groups to direct to the stream. Leave this field blank to return all groups in the business.

When you click âSaveâ, the stream with the parameters you provided will be created within AMP for Endpoints.
If there is a validation failure, the appropriate message will be displayed.
Leave either the Event Type or Groups field blank to direct all respective event types or groups to the created stream and the Splunk index.
Please note: the number of event streams per business is limited to 5.
Updating an input
To update an input, click on its name at the inputs list view. Follow the procedures described previously to change the
stream parameters. Please note: you will not be able to edit the input name or index.
Deleting an input
To delete an input, click the âDeleteâ link in its row at the inputs list view. Confirm your choice to finish the procedure.
The event stream will be deleted from AMP for Endpoints along with the input.
Searching for events
By default, the events from the stream will be directed to the âmainâ index. They will be populated with the sourcetype of cisco:amp:event

The Splunk Add-on for FinTS is based on the open source FinTS library for Python (https://python-fints.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) and allows you to collect various different data from your bank account. For issues or troubleshooting regarding the connectivity I suggest you to look into the Git Repo of the FinTS project (https://github.com/raphaelm/python-fints).
The Add-on provides only management dashboards for online banking accounts, input types and TAN authentication. It contains no analyzation, visualization or alerts of the data. Feel free to dive into your cashflows the way you want. The collected data is ingested as JSON, so it should be usable without any additional field extractions.
Dashboards
Accounts:
The Add-on is based on accounts, they are the first you need to setup. They can be configured in the fints_accounts.conf or using the account management dashboard. Your online banking account requires several parameter to be used like your targets bank Bankleitzahl (BLZ), your banks HBCI server address (Endpoint), if you have multiple numbers under your account your target international bank account number (IBAN) and of course your online banking credentials (User, PIN/Password). The PIN will be stored encrypted (using the splunk.secret) in the passwords.conf. Please don't try to edit it manually, to ensure your password is always encrypted.
Inputs:
The Add-on provides four different inputs which are basically the getters from the FinTS library. Each input can be configured for each account independently. They can be configured in the inputs.conf or using the inputs management dashboard. Each input only requires an account and an input name. Due to the Add-on Builder the current default ingestion interval is 3600 seconds. To avoid redundant ingestion, I suggest that you use the default cron schedule of daily/monthly inputs (e.g. 0 1 *  ). Also note that the transaction input can query more than one day, however due to consistency I've set it to the last day, so that each input can run once a day. I plan to make it more configurable in future releases. Also I have no available accounts with holdings. So I don't know what this input would return. Feel free to contact me for further development in this area.
TAN Authentication:
For the first time and from time to time it is required to authenticate your access with a Transaktionsnummer (TAN). To authenticate your accounts I've implemented an authentication management dashboard. Since the TAN can be generated on various ways, I try to forward the TAN challenge to the webpage. However my banks support only a few TAN methods, so my development in this area is limited. Currently tested and supported are photoTAN, pushTAN and mobileTAN. Feel free to develope further in this area with your own TAN method.
Additional Information
Suggestion for input frequency by type: 
Balance: 0 1 *  * (daily)
Transaction: 0 1 *  * (daily)
Bankinformation: 0 0 1 *  (monthly)
Holding: 0 0 1 *  (monthly)
Custom Search Commands:
For authentication I've implemented two CSCs that enables you to request (fintsauthenticaterequest) and answer a TAN required response (fintsauthenticateresponse). The first one is a generating command that initializes the communication to the bank and puts the dialog on pause to deliver you the TAN request. After you have entered the TAN, the second command (reporting command) takes the previous request search as input, resumes the dialog with the bank and sends the given TAN.
To provide a little more flexibility with the inputs I've also created a CSC to span a variable time range (at least more than only the last day) for transaction queries. I would have also implemented this for the other inputs, however the transaction is the only one currently, that can be configured with date ranges. All inputs are bound to the library which is bound to the FinTS 3.0 protocol and no other input is currently designed to provide a date / range selection, except for transactions. 
Last Notes
I've created this TA to observe my rental-accounts and gain insights of my personal cashflow. This app is far from complete, I'm still struggling to connect all my online banking accounts with the library. Altough the FinTS library has been implemented the way the FinTS3.0 protocol was designed, not every bank supports it yet the way they should. So if you have connecticity issues with your online banking account try to connect with the Troubleshooting Script of the FinTS library under (https://python-fints.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trouble.html). Sometimes it's just a typo.

Then, modify the variables in bin/upgrade-wrapper.bat to reflect the filename/version of the UF msi.
After deployment, the scripted input will execute on startup.  It will compare the app's msi version to the already-installed version.  If upgrade is needed, it will stop the SplunkForwarder service, run msiexec, and start the service.  The script zeroes out the msi file afterwards to conserve storage.
Be aware that the genrandompassword parameter will record the password inside a .log file in the static folder.
Tested on Win 2012 and newer, x64.  Assumes that the UF if running as SYSTEM, and PATH environment variable is set well.  
Note that Splunk has deprecated Windows Server 2012 R2 with version 8.0.0.  From my testing, v8.0.x of the UF works on 2012, but is not officially supported.

http://www.rapid7.com
Using this Application:
Setup:
Please see Splunk's official documentation for the initial installation of the add-on.
After installation, you should be prompted to set up the application. The configuration screen may also be accessed by clicking the ""Configuration"" link within the app's navigation bar or by selecting the 'Set up' action for the add-on within the App Management screen.
On this screen, enter the hostname or IP address of each of your InsightIDR collectors (e.g. collector.mynetwork.com).
Any change to these initial details can performed from the ""Configuration"" screen (accessible from the dashboard under the 'Rapid7 InsightIDR for Splunk' application).
Module details:
Log Advancers:
The term 'log advancer' used within the app refers to what is essentially a port forwarder. The log advancers solely forward data from Splunk to a remote server on a specific port. 
Note that the log advancers within the app are distinct from a Splunk Forwarder and do not comply with any of the expectations which come with using a Splunk Forwarder.
Log Advancers Screen:
This screen displays all available log advancers. You have the option to create, edit or delete log advancers based on the data source.
To enable a log forwarder for a data source, click the corresponding ""Enable"" link. This will bring you to the ""Configure a Log Advancer"" screen (which is detailed below).
When a log advancer has been configured, clicking the ""Edit"" button will bring you back to this page so details may be amended. Alternatively, clicking the ""Delete"" button will remove the associated settings for that data source.
Please note that if you make any changes to the log advancers, you must restart the Splunk server for them to take effect. 
Log Advancer Configuration Screen:
This screen allows you to select data to send to InsightIDR, as well as where to send it.
Data source - Host, source, or sourcetype. 

Host - The name of the machine from which the data originates.
Source - The source of data from the machine (such as tcp:1234 or /var/log/firewall.log)
Sourcetype - The sourcetype with which Splunk has tagged the data. 

Regex - Optional - Regular expression for further data filtering. Only if the regex matches the whole payload will the      data be forwarded.
Collector - The host (presumably of one of your collectors) to which data will be sent. Make sure the selected collector has the corresponding event source set up to receive these events. The dropdown is filled with the collectors specified on the ""Configuration"" screen.
Protocol - The protocol to use when sending the data.
Port - The port on the collector machine to which data will be sent.
Note: This application must be installed on the Splunk node indexing the data that you want to forward to InsightIDR. Further to this it is preferable that the raw data should be passed to InsightIDR i.e. the untransformed data from the socket rather than the transformed data with a sourcetype.
Receivers Screen:
Under the Receivers section, there is an entry for each port on which Splunk is listening for data.
To create a new receiver, enter the collector, protocol and port and click the ""Create"" button.
To delete a receiver, click the corresponding ""Delete"" link. 
Note that only a single receiver may have the same combination of collector, protocol and port.
Also, in order to have multiple receivers listen to the same protocol and port combination, they must each have a unique collector specified. It is not possible to have a receiver without a collector and a receiver with a collector for the same protocol and port combination.

Collector - Optional - If selected, only data coming from the specified host will be handled by this receiver. The dropdown is filled with the collectors specified on the ""Configuration"" screen.
Protocol - The protocol to use to listen for events.
Port - The port on which to listen.
Sourcetype - The sourcetype Splunk will apply to the data matching this receiver.

Debugging:
Two log files are available to help debug issues contained within <splunk_home>/var/log/splunk/:

splunkd.log - Splunk general log
rapid7idr.log - Log for the Rapid7 Technology Add-on

Also, each page logs to the web console. Please refer to the documentation for your browser of choice for details regarding how to capture the log.
Please contact support@rapid7.com for help, including all relevant files.

It pushes alerts and charts to your cellphone from your Splunk servers, when you're on the beach. It's how you get your Splunk data conveniently on the go.  splunkeverywhere is a one-way data push from firewalled splunk servers to mobile devices, via a cloud-based service run by Splunk or your own organization.
Not an official Splunk product, but a really useful skunkworks project. Use it and love it.
How can I get it?

Request an account for the splunkeverywhere cloud server.
Sign-up to get the iPhone app (Android coming soon).
Download the Splunk app (on this webpage!) and install it on your Splunk instance.

What are the benefits?
It gives you quick and easy data on the go, sharing only what you want with whom you want. It's optimized for the mobile platform, and constant availability of critical data.
Who is it for?
It's for everyone that can benefit from critical data. In fact, splunkeverywhere creates new class of users that otherwise would not use Splunk.
What does the Splunk app do?
It adds the ""share"" search command. For all your alerts and saved searches that you want to make available to mobile users, 24/7, simply append ""| share somename"". User's subscribed up to the somename channel will get the charts and data on their phones. Add the ""alert=true"" option to the share command, and the phone will beep and give an alert when new data fires.
What does it look like?
Screenshots
Why is mobile important
According the users questioned by the Aberdeen Group:

Mobile BI can give competitive advantage: 54%
Increase productivity of mobile employees: 41%
Removes delays in alerting key decision makers to critical information: 30% 

What data would useful on the go?
How are your systems, users, data performing? Is anything irregular? Is there anything I need to be alarmed about? No, that's good to know too.
Is the mobile app a clone of the Splunk user interface?
No. It's a web and native mobile app, with functionality appropriate for mobile. It is not the Splunk UI ported to mobile. It supports very limited, simple interaction for small devices. It is alert-driven.
Is it good for all my Splunk searching
No. splunkeverywhere is a one-way push of results. It is not an interactive search interface. For more investigative searching, you'll need to full power of the Splunk user interface.
Why do I need this, can't I just email PDFs to my phone?
Yes and no. This is a dedicated app that allows you to see alerts and the charts that come with it. It has a dedicated web interface that allows you to specify who sees what. Imagine an environment where the users are NOT just splunk admin people, but a dozen people in marketing that want to get charts on download numbers daily, and they want to get alerts other metrics drop below a threshold. etc.
Using this mobile app, your splunk alerts are not mixed in with all your other emails, work and personal, (I get over 100 a day) and it's not an attached PDF that you have to open up, which isn't the friendliest interface. Your splunk alerts come from a specific Splunk alerting app, that jumps you right to the chart. With the email-pdf approach, mobile email clients usually alert you on every email or never. If you want to receive alerts on specific results, each user would have to write email rules or have a separate mailbox for particular types of urgent alerts.
Using this mobile app, you have a web interface accessible from anywhere that lists out which users get what alerts. Adding/deleting users that get alerts is trivial. If you use the email-pdf approach, a splunk admin has to go (vpn) into your splunk instance, find the specific alert object and edit the ""To:"" line of the alert, for each user you want to add/delete.
In short, if you like the fact that you get urgent splunk alerts are separate from your email, and aren't mixed in, and you like the fact that you can easily edit who gets which alerts, try this app.",Version 1.1,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/676a7d58-6900-11e3-b4de-005056ad5c72.png,Utilities,http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAAFA,689,0,splunk,5,7,David Carasso,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/carasso,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

It was developed to decode field values containing ciphered email subjects as a by-product of an email going through Cisco ESA email proxy. Add-on provides a custom search command to do this. The main advantage of this command is that it is able to decode any MIME-encoded string in any charset, not just in UTF-8 which is a limitation of standard SPL eval function urldecode.
System Requirements
None
Installation
Install on Splunk Search Head only.
Configuration
No need to configure this app.
Usage
Use command as per example below. Input and output fields may have the same name.
Syntax:
| mimedecode <field_with_encoded_text> <field_with_decoded_text>
Example:
| makeresults count=1
| eval field1_in=""=?UTF-8?Q?Alert_Google_=E2=80=93_Bank_of_England?=""
| eval field2_in=""=?ISO-8859-2?Q?RE=3A_Odpov=EC=EF=3A_Terasy_C1?=""
| mimedecode field1_in field1_out
| mimedecode field2_in field2_out

Input StringInput MIME-encoded CharsetOutput String
=?UTF-8?Q?Alert_Google_=E2=80=93_Bank_of_England?=UTF-8Alert Google - Bank of England
=?ISO-8859-2?Q?RE=3A_Odpov=EC=EF=3A_Terasy_C1?=ISO-8859-2RE: OdpovÄÄ: Terasy C1

Testing:
Add-on was successfully tested with these charsets: UTF-8, Windows-1250, ISO-8859-2. However, it should work for many other charsets just as well. 
This add-on relies on Python and its email standard library (an email and MIME handling package). You can check details at https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.header.html.
Bugs
There were some issues with Japanese charset. This has to be investigated more.

Known Issues
Version 1.4.2 of G Suite For Splunk has the following known issues:


According to stackoverflow, there are indications that the Google Apps Admin API has an unspecified delay introduced into the events that are collected. This is most likely due to how Google collects the events and the global nature of the events. To mitigate this issue, the G Suite For Splunk Modular Input has a built-in delay in the consumption of events. If you run the modular input at 30 minutes, there will be a 30 minute delay of events. If you run at 1 hour, there will be a 1 hour delay in events.

1. For each Search Head in the environment, deploy a non-configured copy of the App. DO NOT SEND TA or IA to a Search Head Cluster (SHC). 1. For each indexer in the environment, deploy a copy of the TA-GSuiteForSplunk Add-On that is located as mentioned above. 1. For a single Data Collection Node OR Heavy Forwarder (a full instance of Splunk is required), install IA-GSuiteForSplunk and configure through the GUI.
User Guide
Key concepts for G Suite For Splunk


You must have enabled the G Suite APIs at https://console.developers.google.com


You must have configured a credential for use with this App at https://console.developers.google.com.


You must AUTHORIZE this app to make requests into G Suite APIs.


Scopes Defined are here: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes


Configure G Suite For Splunk for use with G Suite Admin Reporting.
Requires: Admin SDK API, and Google Drive API Optional: Google Analytics Reporting API Each API endpoint has individual APIs that need to be enabled within https://console.developers.google.com.




report:[all, gcp, chat, meet, jamboard, access_transparency, groups_enterprise, user_accounts, groups, mobile, admin, calendar, drive, login, token, rules]


These input service names require the Admin SDK API enabled.


Additionally, the drive report requires the Google Drive API enabled.


These inputs generally do not require Extra Configuration options in the Modular Input. An empty {} is still needed where advanced features are not.


These inputs should be adjusted per Google guidelines for the different activities.


By default, the Modular Input will only pull the previous 24 hours of data to prevent memory overflows.








analytics:[metadata, report]


These input service names require the Analytics Reporting API v4 and Analytics API APIs enabled.


These inputs do require Extra Configuration. These inputs should not be enabled lightly, and require a little bit of prior research and planning.


IF YOU DONT KNOW WHAT THIS IS, DO NOT ENABLE IT


THIS IS A DARK FEATURE.








usage:[customer, user, chrome]


These input service names require the same as the report services.




These inputs can have extra configuration, namely historical_days to do the initial data ingestion.

When configuring the modular input, use the Extra Configuration option of {historical_days: 180}





IMPORTANT: BE CAREFUL WITH USER REPORTING. If you ingest 365 days of data (back fill the information), you will end up with 365 * # of users events to pull and could cause a Splunk/System failure.


If you see a 404 Error in the logs relating to the usage reports, THESE ARE NORMAL.


The Customer Usage should include classrooms usage by default.






Configure G Suite For Splunk for use with Google Spreadsheets
Requires: Google Sheets API

When setting up the modular input, make sure you grab the Spreadsheet ID from the URL of the spreadsheet you need. Auto-discovery of available spreadsheets is not available (but an ER is in for it).

Spreadsheet Destinations




Index


Takes the information from the sheet and indexes it to the specified index. This is useful to get lookups from a Heavy Forwarder to a Search head.


Use the provided Dashboard to re-assemble via saved scheduled search.








KVStore


Takes the information from the sheet and places it into a KVStore collection.


It will create the needed collections and transforms if needed.


Order of the COLUMNS is NOT kept, and the KVStore will be sorted via ASCII sort based on the column name.








Ordered KVStore


Takes the information from the sheet and places it into a KVStore collection.


It will create the needed collections and transforms if needed.


Order of the COLUMNS IS kept, the column names are stored in ROW 0








CSV Lookup


Takes the information from the sheet and places it into a CSV based lookup.


It will create the needed transforms if needed.


Order of the COLUMNS is NOT kept, and the CSV lookup will be sorted via ASCII sort based on the column name.

Requirements


Service Account JSON File from GCP. (https://console.developers.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)


Create a new Splunk credential with Realm: gsuite_bigquery and username is \<your_domain> (your domain as configured in the input)


The password for that credential is the ENTIRE ON ONE LINE JSON file from GCP for the service account.


Configure G Suite For Splunk for use with G Suite Admin Reporting
Requires: G Suite Alert Center API Note: EXPERIMENTAL (scope not valid) #. alerts:[all, takeout, gmail, identity, operations, state, mobile]
 1.  These inputs generally do not require Extra Configuration options in the Modular Input. An empty {} is still needed where advanced features are not.  2.  By default, the Modular Input will only pull the previous 24 hours of data to prevent memory overflows.  3.  Uses the https://www.googleapis.com/auth/apps.alerts scope.  4.  View more information at https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/alertcenter/reference/alert-types .
Notes
IMPORTANT: You must Authorize the APIS with the SAME USER that allowed access to the APIs in the developer console (for GSuite customers - GCP see below).
Overview of authorization procedures are found here: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount#overview.
GCP Users: It has been tested to use an Credential generated in the GCP console (same credential type as outlined on the OAuth App Config page). You can use an authorized admin to Approve the OAuth Scopes. It is unknown what happens when the approving Admin user account is disabled.
Modular Input
NOTE: You will need to configure a new modular input for each domain

Follow the steps on the Application Configuration dashboard to configure the modular input.

NOTE: After testing in a much bigger environment, weve been able to set these recommendations for intervals. You will need 4 modular input definitions.


calendar, token, mobile, groups, login, saml, Chrome OS Devices #. These are done at an cron interval of 15 */4 * * *


drive #. Drive is done at a seconds interval of 600 - 1200 depending on organization size, and traffic flow of drive operations.


Usage - User, Customer #. These are done at a seconds interval of 86400


admin, rules, chat, gplus #. These are done at a seconds interval of 600


Indexes
By default all events will be written to the main index. You should change the index in the configuration files to match your specific index.
Configure Proxy Support
This App Supports proxy configuration. Configure the proxy first in the Application Configuration dashboard, and then choose it during the modular input configuration. The proxy name MUST BE gapps_proxy for the authorization to work correctly.
Troubleshoot G Suite For Splunk


Check the Monitoring Console (>=v6.5) for errors


Visit the Application Health dashboard


Search for eventtype=googleapps_error


CIM
As of v1.4.0 of this app, we should support version 4.15 of the CIM.
EXPERIMENTAL
There are portions of this app that are experimental, or you might see odd code. This is for some up coming features, might work, might not.
Lookups
G Suite For Splunk contains the following lookup files:

gsuite_labels.csv : This allows pretty labels on select dashboards.

Event Generator
G Suite For Splunk does not make use of an event generator. This allows the product to display data, when there are no inputs configured.

Ironstream enables you to collect and forward mainframe log data, including security data, into Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security and Splunk IT Service Intelligence where you can get that true 360-degree view.
Users can then easily search, analyze, and visualize the data for powerful business intelligence reporting -- without needing specialized expertise and different monitoring systems for mainframe.
Make more sense of the valuable machine data hidden away on your mainframe.
Get started with Ironstream today!

Depends on your needs, you can use one of the following methods:
a. Configure Splunk universal forwarder of MBX to run as Exchange Admin, enable the following 3 stanza in inputs.conf, and let Splunk generate the csv, collect/parse csv file and cleanup those csv file. Ingest csv file will consume less Splunk license.
i)   [powershell://generate_exchange_mailbox_forward_rules_csv]
ii)  [powershell://cleanup_mailbox_forward_rules_csv]
iii) [monitor://$SPLUNK_HOME\var\log\TA_MS_ExchangeForwardingRules_for_splunk\MSExchange_ForwardRule_.csv]
b. Configure Splunk universal forwarder of MBX to run as Exchange Admin, enable the following stanza in inputs.conf, and let Splunk directly collect/parse using PowerShell.
i)   [script://.\bin\run_exchange_ps.cmd on_premises_exchange_mailbox_forward_rules.ps1]
c. Leave Splunk universal forwarder of MBX user unchanged, manually configure a windows schedule to collect/cleanup Exchange Forwarding Rules using our PowerShell script, enable the following stanza in inputs.conf to collect the generate csv file.
i)  You need to provide the correct csv_path and csv_file arguments to the powershell collection script, e.g.:
""C:\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\etc\apps\TA_MS_ExchangeForwardingRules_for_splunk\bin\powershell\on_premises_exchange_mailbox_forward_rules.ps1"" -csv_path ""C:\Splunk"" -csv_file ""MSExchange_ForwardRule""
ii)  You need to provide the correct csv_path, csv_file and age arguments to the powershell collection script, e.g.:
""C:\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\etc\apps\TA_MS_ExchangeForwardingRules_for_splunk\bin\powershell\cleanup_exchange_mailbox_forward_rules_csv.ps1"" -csv_path ""C:\Splunk"" -csv_file ""MSExchange_ForwardRule"" -age ""-3""
iii) Configure the correct path of generate csv for the following stanza:
[monitor://$SPLUNK_HOME\var\log\TA_MS_ExchangeForwardingRules_for_splunk\MSExchange_ForwardRule_.csv]

Other considerations:

You may deploy this add-on to DR/standby Exchange servers.
If you are planning to run it on non-Exchange instance, you need to install Exchange Management tools.
For mininum permission to run the powershell script, please refer to following:

WURFL InSight provides device intelligence about mobile smartphones, tablets, desktops, and other devices that are visiting your website. It detects these devices based on the analysis of the user agent found in the HTTP request that is recorded in your Web logs. Therefore, you need to ensure these Web logs, and specifically the user agent field, have been loaded into Splunk correctly. In addition, please have JAVA 1.7 or higher installed. 
Note: Click here to activate your trial license.
The following examples demonstrate the usage of the Dashboard, Search, Pivot, Configuration and Settings features.
1) Dashboard: WURFL InSight for Splunk comes with a Dashboard that contains the Device, Form Factor, Manufacturer and OS capabilities. Input Filters (Eg: Time Range, Form Factor, and Regions) allow users to see trends across the WURFL capabilities in their own weblogs.
2) Pivot: These are Splunk features that make it easy to create advanced reports without    resorting to the Splunk search language. WURFL Device Capabilities can be included in   Pivot via the WURFL Data Model. 
Note: Please refer to the Splunk Pivot documentation for more information on
          using Pivot here.
3) App Search Interface: To add WURFL device data to input records, the âwurfl_lookupâ command is used. This command adds WURFL capabilities, which are licensed, to the input record.
4) Configuration: If you have customized WURFLd installation, you can provide the installed path by accessgin Configuration tab from within the App Interface
4) Settings: To make sure your WURFL licensed capabilities are in sync with splunk search interface, access Settings UI tab from within the App Interface.",Version 1.8.16,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/fb0013a0-d23b-11e6-976c-02f13bdc2585.png,"IT Operations, Business Analytics",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,361,0,splunk,5,6,ScientiaMobile Inc.,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/scientiamobile,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

This app is not officially supported by Splunk Support. If you have a current Splunk Enterprise Support entitlement, Splunk will provide best-effort support for cases involving this app directly, but such cases will not be subject to the Splunk Enterprise Support SLA.
Getting Started
This app is designed to provide comprehensive data collection from Dropbox Business and a set of dashboards covering sharing, device, application, and security activity. 
The data collection includes the events returned by the Dropbox get_events API, which includes:

Login activity.
Membership activity (i.e. requests/additions/removals).
Device activity.
API-based Application activity.
Sharing activity both within and outside the team.
Security metrics, including detailed user and path tracking.

In addition, this App is CIM-compliant: it leverages both the Authentication and Change Analysis Data Models.
Prerequisites

A Dropbox Business admin account

Note: The Dropbox Business admin account is used to authorize the Splunk App for Dropbox Business and generate the OAuth 2.0 access token. 
Setup
For users of the v1.x.x of the app, see upgrade notes below.

Download the app here.

From the Splunk Web home screen, click the gear icon next to Apps. 



Click Install app from file. 



Locate the downloaded file and click Upload. 



If Splunk Enterprise prompts you to restart, do so.

To connect to Dropbox Business, visit the 'configuration' tab to enter your OAuth to Dropbox access token.
Click the 'Add' button.
Clicking the link below the 'Acces token' field will initiate the OAuth request to get a token.





Next, visit the 'input' tab.  The input will prompt you to select the account created above and specify optional event filtering options.   
Configuration inputs include:
Name: This may be any unique name.  If you are using Splunk with multiple Dropbox teams, naming the input after the team name is recommended.
Interval: The frequency at which to check Dropbox for updates.  Setting this value between 30 seconds and 5 minutes is typical.
Account:  The account used to connect to Dropbox.
Start Time: This parameter is optional, and by default 90 days ago.  Typically users will want to look at recent data, and monitor going forward.  Setting this value far in the past may take some time to download & process all historical events.
Category: This parameter is optional, and by default will include all dropbox event categories.  If you wish to only index a subset of Dropbox events, specify the target Dropbox event category.  






Dropbox Events
For full documentation of event types and attributes, visit the Dropbox get_events developer documentation
Troubleshooting
For additional troubleshooting, adjust the apps log level in the 'configuration' tab and consult the app logs (search 'searchindex=_internal sourcetype=dropbox', or view var/log/splunk/splunk_app_dropbox_dropbox.log).  These logs will indicate successful connectivity to Dropbox, or reveal errors returned by the Dropbox API.
Common mis-configuration that would result in Dropbox API returning an error include copying an invalid auth token or specifying an invalid category name.  For more information, refer to the Dropbox get_events documentation.
Upgrading from 1.x.x
Note that the Dropbox API & corresponding configuration of this App have changed substantially from version 1.x.x to 2.x.x.  As such, users of the V1.x.x app are encouraged to remove the V1 app and perform a new installation of the app, rather than perform an upgrade.
The format of Dropbox events have changed from version 1.x to 2.x.  The Dropbox events migration guide can help you update any customizations.
In addition to the formatting Dropbox events, authorization has changed slightly in the V2 App. Authorization is now per-input, allowing you to connect to multiple Dropbox teams in Splunk.  The OAuth grant requires only the Dropbox 'Team Auditing' permission.  
If upon upgrading your app you see a 'Splunk' and 'Splunk Integration' app in your Dropbox console, you may unlink the prior 'Splunk Integration' authorization from the V1 App.",Version 2.1.1,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/a5d438c2-22f3-11eb-a5e7-02fa7700cf1c.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance, Business Analytics",http://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-software-license-agreement.html,"1,650",0,splunk,5,1,Jason Conger,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/jconger_splunk,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise

The Splunk for DNS will provide you with a dashboard that will provides you with summary of DNS actives in your network, assuming you have a well-defined DNS infrastructure.

Requirements:

1 or more Bind, version 8 or 9, servers installed on your preferred Linux server.
A syslog client/forwarder (Syslog-NG). 
Splunk has a data source configured for receiving Syslog data (UDP/TCP) with the source type set to ""syslog"".

Installation:
The installation guidance is one way to get DNS data into Splunk. You can use other methods, as long as the data source type is set to ""syslog"".
  1. Install the Bind server components on your preferred Linux host
  2. Install the Syslog-NG, or your preferred syslog forwarder.( ) on the host Bind server. 
  3. Configure, see below.
Configuration:

Configure Bind:
Configure Bind using the configuration sample below. 


Configure Syslog-NG to process the log entries in the bind log file:
Create a source for Syslog-NG to process, using the Bind log file defined in the bind config.
Define a destination for Syslog to send log data over UDP or TCP 514. The destination should be your Splunk instance.
Create a Syslog-NG target. This tells Syslog-NG to process the defined source (in section a) and send it to the define destination. See the Syslog configuration sample below.


Restart services
Restart Syslog-NG
Restart Bind


Verify that data is being logged
Check the bind log file to see if query and resolver data is being logged.
Check that Splunk is receiving syslog data from the host Bind server. You should see a named in the search type on the Search summary.

Usage (to get the current thresholds for multiple KPIs)

| getitsithresholds mode=(now|nowextended) [services=Comma,Seperated,ServiceIds]

These modes are always a generating command and will return the current threshold for all KPIs in enabled services. This mode is useful when you are reporting current status of KPIs by searching against the itsi_summary index.  If a comma seperated list of service IDs is supplied in the ""services"" argument, then only KPIs for those services will be returned. 
In the ""now"" mode, the following columns will be returned: service_id, kpi_id, threhsolds. Use ""nowextended"" mode, to return more columns. Its also possible to return X hours forward in time by using a plus symbol. Here is an example to return all thresholds for all services, for the current time it runs, plus the next 23 hours. Useful if you want to run once a day, and output the results to a lookup table. 
| getitsithresholds mode=now+23 | outputlookup itsi_all_thresholds.csv

Then you can use this threshold in subsequent searches like so:
| <some search that has fields 'service_id' and 'kpi_id'>  
| eval hour = floor(((now() / 3600) - 120) % 168) 
| lookup itsi_all_thresholds.csv service_id kpi_id hour OUTPUT thresholds


Usage (for charting a single KPI)
| getitsithresholds service=SERVICEID kpi=KPI mode=(normal|raw|columns)

This can be used as a generating command or a streaming command. If used as a streaming command, it must have a _time field/column. It will use this _time column to match the thresholds with the correct data rows. Data can be supplied in any granularity however if the time block extends through multiple time policies, then only the first time policy will be output. For this reason, its best to use data with hourly granularity.
Simple example to retrieve thresholds (generating command):
| getitsithresholds service=c2d8f443-fd65-4872-b3b8-1ac7757b57f6 kpi=a672f70631ce28a0be31e1f2

Example showing how to enrich data by adding thresholds (streaming command):
index=""itsi_summary"" itsi_service_id=c2d8f443-fd65-4872-b3b8-1ac7757b57f6 kpiid=a672f70631ce28a0be31e1f2 
| timechart span=1h avg(alert_value) as alert_value
| getitsithresholds service=c2d8f443-fd65-4872-b3b8-1ac7757b57f6 kpi=a672f70631ce28a0be31e1f2


Modes:
mode=normal (default) - will output a single field regions containing the severity name, the colour and the threshold value.
mode=raw - will output an unmodified JSON structure for each time policy
mode=columns - will output data as individual fields (hour, policy, min, max, severityX..., colorX..., thresholdX...). ITSI can be configured with different amounts of severities for each time policy, this is why the columns are output like this.
mode=now - output only the thresholds for the current point in time
mode=nowextended - output only the thresholds for the current point in time
Output from this command (using mode=normal) can be charted using the ""Region Chart Visualization""


Round:
From version 1.6 this addon will now use simple rounding logic to round the thresholds. You can switch this off using round=f

This TA temporarily stores PMI search data results into a local key value store.
You can view the contents in the following way:
 - From the Splunk UI navigate to Apps > Qintel PMI Add-on for Splunk > Datasets.
 - Click on qintel_pmi_cache.
Cleaning the Cache
This TA installs a saved search that runs every 5 minutes on a cron schedule to purge the PMI search results that are in your local KV store and are older than 24 hours.
You can clean the feed manually in the following way:
- From the Splunk UI navigate to Apps > Qintel PMI Add-on for Splunk > Reports and find qintel_pmi_clean_cache and click Open in Search 
CUSTOM COMMANDS
The following command is included as a part of the add-on:

qsentry
Search format: QUERY | pmi cve_field=cve 
Purpose: Retrieves context information for all of the given CVEs from Qintel PMI.



Dashboard and Auto-Enrichment
This TA does not include dashboards. 
After installing the Splunk CIM, when you configure your vulnerability scanner to upload logs the events should automatically be tagged appropriately.
If the events aren't being tagged appropriately you need to follow these steps to add enrichment tags to events, and then install the Qintel Dashboards App for Splunk

From the Splunk Web home screen, select the ""Settings"" dropdown from the top menu bar.
Select ""Event Types"" from the dropdown
Click the ""New Event Type"" button to add a new event type

Name: descriptive name of the event type
Search String: search string specifying the events to be enriched (e.g. ""sourcetype=auth"" or ""host=10.1.1.1"")
Tag(s): 'vulnerability', 'report'


Click ""Save""

Note: it is important that the Qintel PMI Add-on for Splunk be configured as the ""Destination App"". If this is not possible, ensure the sharing permissions on the event type are such that the Qintel PMI Add-on for Splunk can access it (""Everyone/Read"" from ""All Apps"" is sufficient)
Returns
Splunk events are enriched with the following fields that are returned from Qintel PMI:
qintel_cve_actors
qintel_cve_actor_types
qintel_cve_affected_system
qintel_cve_affected_version

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2766,2022-01-10,08:12:12 AM,Splunk Add-on For Zenoss,,"Aug. 25, 2021","New in 2.x
The 2.1 release brings:

support to py3 at both Zenoss Event modular input and custom alert
compatibility with Splunk Cloud
integration of proxy (incl. basic authentication)

The 2.0 release brings the Zenoss Event custom alert action and the credential management dashboard.
Upgrading to 2.1.0
Since version 2.0.5 introduces major changes to input definition and folders organization, please make sure to uninstall the add-on before installing the latest version.
Zenoss Compatibility
This has been tested against and is known to be compatible with Zenoss 4.x and 5.x and Zenoss Cloud with token based authentication.
Credential Management Dashboard
The dashboard is a CRUD interface to the storage/passwords REST endpoint. You can create, update, delete and reveal the password for any credentials stored. Right click on any row to reveal a context menu for the update and delete actions. You can also leverage the realm field to describe a connection; e.g. - prod or dev.
For full control over passwords, including RBAC, use the REST storage/passwords Manager for Splunk.
Use the Credential Management dashboard to securely store credentials, including Zenoss Cloud and proxy tokens, for your Zenoss server instances. 
Requirements
You must be in the admin role or have the admin_all_objects capability enabled to use the Credential Management dashboard and configure both Zenoss Event custom alert action and Modular Input.
Create credentials via Credential Management Dashboard
Credentials will be securely stored in the storage/passwords REST endpoint and accessed by the add-on to either ingest data or trigger a Zenoss Event custom alert action. Please re-read the Requirements section before moving on.
Splunk for Zenoss -> Credential Management -> Create
Provide username, password and realm to define a credential account.

In case of Zenoss token based authentication, store the token in the password field for your defined user under the credential management tool

Configure Modular Input
Settings -> Data inputs -> Zenoss

Credential Account: reference the credential account name to authenticate with your Zenoss instance 
Credential Realm: reference the credential account realm to authenticate with your Zenoss instance
Zenoss Web Interface: Web interface to Zenoss server (e.g. https://zenoss5.myhost.mydomain for Zenoss 5.x connections or https://myinstance.zenoss.io/cz0 for Zenoss Cloud)
Device Name (Optional): Filter to only pull from a specific device. Defaults to all devices
Disable SSL Certificate Verification: Zenoss 5.x installs - check to disable SSL verification 
    > WARNING This is a potentially dangerous option
CA File: Optional: Zenoss 5.x installs - specify certificate authority file in PEM format for certificates signed by untrusted root authority
Timezone (Optional): Timezone of Zenoss server - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/* List_of_tz_database_time_zones  
Archive Threshold: Zenoss Event Archive Threshold (minutes) setting. Interval to read archive table. Leave blank for Zenoss default of 4320
Event Checkpoint Removal: Zenoss Delete Archived Events Older Than (days) setting. Used to keep checkpoint file clean. Leave blank for Zenoss default of 90.  
Start Date (Optional): Specify a starting date to pull events from or leave blank for ALL events. E.g. 2015-03-16T00:00:00  
Index Closed Events (Optional): Index eventState ""Closed""  
Index Cleared Events (Optional): Index eventState ""Cleared""  
Index Archived Events (Optional): Index events form the Archive table  
Index Suppressed Events (Optional): Index eventState ""Suppressed""             
Index Repeat Events (Optional): Index repeat events. Index an event every time the count increments  for an evid. This will result in the same event getting indexed with a new latestTime timestamp. This is useful for fine grained analytics on events. 
    > This setting could lead to an increase in indexing volume  depending on your environment
Sourcetype: Set to Manual and leave blank to set to zenoss-events 

More Settings

Interval: Defaults to 60 seconds  
Host: specify zenoss hostname  
Index: specify zenoss index  
Proxy URI: specify proxy URI (e.g. https://my.proxy.net:3128)
Proxy Credential Account: reference credential account name created via Credential Management dashboard for a basic authentication at the proxy. Leave empty otherwise.
Proxy Credential Realm: reference credential realm created via Credential Management dashboard for a basic authentication at the proxy

Configuring Zenoss Event Custom Alert Action
1. Create credentials
If you haven't done it yet, please create credentials for your Zenoss instance using the Credential Management dashboard as explained in Create credentials section before moving on.
2. Create a saved search
Create a saved search that meets your criteria for creating an event. The alert script requires field/table output with the following names (case sensitive):

device OR host (REQUIRED) - device/host name  
severity (REQUIRED) - severity of alert - Supported values are: 
""Critical"" 
""Error"" 
""Warning"" 
""Info"" 
""Debug""
""Clear""  


summary (REQUIRED) - Plain text summary of the event  
component (OPTIONAL) - Component name  
evclass (OPTIONAL) - Event class name  
evclasskey (OPTIONAL) - Event class key  

SPL for an example search
index=oidemo sourcetype=access_combined 
| stats count(eval(status=""404"")) as web_error by host 
| eval severity=case(web_error > 100 AND web_error < 500, ""Warning"", web_error > 500 AND web_error < 1000, ""Error"", web_error > 1000, ""Critical"") 
| eval summary=""Web 404 Error - greater than 1000 errors"" 
| eval evclass=""/Status/Web"" 
| table host, severity, summary, evclass
Save the search as an Alert and schedule it to run per your desired frequency. Set to trigger for each result. Under Add Actions select Zenoss Event. Fill in the required fields. Reference the credential account and optionally the realm to authenticate with your Zenoss instance. An event for each row in the table will be generated in Zenoss when the alert is triggered.
Debugging
View the customer alert action log located at $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/zenoss_event_modalert.log to troubleshoot issues with the Zenoss Event custom alert action.
Data Model
The app ships with a Data Model that comes unaccelerated out of the box. To acclerate the data model go to 'Settings -> Data models'. Under 'Actions' for the Events data model, select 'Edit -> Edit Acceleration' and select the summary range that fits your needs.
CIM Compliant
This app is CIM compliant and maps to the Alerts data model.

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3338,2022-01-10,08:12:14 AM,Custom Timewrap Visualization,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/screenshots/ddeb67fc-677c-11e7-9f0a-02e4f408b860.png,"June 25, 2017","Galleries
After installing the timewrap visualization app, launch it to see a couple gallery dashboards with live examples of how to use the visualization.  If you no longer need the gallery and want to hide the app from navigation menus, you can make the app invisible.  The timewrap visualization itself will still be available to use in all other apps.
Basic Configuration
This XML snippet will plot 3 months of data with a month-over-month overlay:
<viz type=""viz_timewrap.timewrap"">
    <title>Default chart appearance</title>
    <search>
        <query>[...] | timechart span=1d sum(bytes) as ""Bytes Transferred""</query>
        <earliest>-3mon@mon</earliest>
        <latest>now</latest>
    </search>
</viz>
Note: For best results, the bin size of the query should be aligned with the point span of the visualization.  In the example above, the query time range produces a month-over-month visualization with a point span of 1 day (i.e. a point for each day in the month).  The span=1d argument to timechart aligns the query bin size to that point span.
Trellis Configurations
This XML snippet will show two timewrap visualizations, one for the ""Bytes Transferred"" time series and one for the ""Average Latency"" time series:
<viz type=""viz_timewrap.timewrap"">
    <search>
        <query>[...] | timechart span=5m sum(bytes) as ""Bytes Transferred"", avg(latency) as ""Avgerage Latency""</query>
        <earliest>-4h@h<earliest>
        <latest>now<latest>
    </search>
    <option name=""height"">400</option>
    <option name=""trellis.enabled"">1</option>
    <option name=""trellis.size"">large</option>
</viz>
This XML snippet will show a timewrap visualization for each value of server_id, displaying the ""Bytes Transferred"" time series for that specific server:
<viz type=""viz_timewrap.timewrap"">
    <search>
        <query>| [...] | timechart span=1h sum(bytes) as ""Bytes Transferred"" by server_id</query>
        <earliest>-7d@d<earliest>
        <latest>now</latest>
    </search>
    <option name=""height"">800</option>
    <option name=""trellis.enabled"">1</option>
    <option name=""trellis.size"">large</option>
</viz>
Notes: The ""large"" trellis size is recommended for the timewrap visualization.  For crowded plots, rotating the x-axis labels and/or re-positioning the legend (see Customization Options below) are good ways to free up space and make the plot more readable.
Customization Options
axisLabelFormat
The format to use when displaying dates and times can be configured for the x-axis.  The formatting rules are specified as shown here.
The default behavior is to choose a format based on the current visualization data.

The default behavior is to choose a format based on the current visualization data.
xLabelRotation
Values: ""on"" or ""off""
Default: ""off""
When enabled, rotates the x-axis labels by 90 degrees.
legendPlacement
Values: ""right"", ""bottom"" or ""none""
Default: ""right""
Customizes the location of the legend, or when set to ""none"", hides the legend.
pointMarkers
Values: ""on"" or ""off""
Default: ""off""
When enabled, shows a marker on each point.
Drilldown
Clicking on a point will drill down to the events that occurred during the time range that point represents.

Version 1.1 adds the ability to handle messages formatted according to RFC 6587.
DESCRIPTION
This is an Add-On for syslog data formatted according to the RFC 5424 or RFC 6587 specifications.
INSTALLATION
Set sourcetype=""rfc5424_syslog"" for all RFC5424 data inputs. This app includes
index-time transformations for the ""host"" field, so should be in place BEFORE
data is indexed.
AVAILABLE FIELDS
The following fields are extracted:

prival - This integer encodes the syslog facility and severity. Use the convert_facility_severity macro, described below, to decode the facility and severity fields.
appname - The field APP-NAME described in RFC5424
procid - The field PROCID described in RFC5424
msgid - The field MSGID described in RFC5424
host - The field HOSTNAME described in RFC5424. NOTE: This field is an index-time transformation

Within a structured data element (i.e., [...]), the following fields are extracted:

sdid - The field SD-ID described in RFC5424. This field is evaluated as a multi-value field.
key/value pairs - All KV pairs (i.e., field1=""value1"") are extracted, but are not evaluated as multi-value pairs.

SEARCH TRICKS
To extract the FACILITY and SEVERITY values from the PRIVAL value:
sourcetype=""rfc5424_syslog"" | `convert_facility_severity`

To convert FACILITY values into text descriptions:
sourcetype=""rfc5424_syslog"" | `convert_facility_severity` | lookup facility_lookup facility

To convert SEVERITY values into text descriptions:
sourcetype=""rfc5424_syslog"" | `convert_facility_severity` | lookup severity_lookup severity

KNOWN ISSUES/LIMITATIONS

Fields which appear more than once in an event (i.e., field1=""value1"" field1=""value2"") will not be evaluated as multi-value fields
Within a structured data block, the SDID is not associated with the local field names; it is simply another multi-value field, ""sdid""
The MSG section of the event, if it exists, is not parsed by this app.",Version 1.1,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/image/default_icon.png,Utilities,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,"2,834",0,splunk,4,6,David Millis,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/dmillis,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

This technology add-on gathers capacity, general and health data regarding your Splunk environment.  It can send the data to our team of Splunk Certified Consultants at RTP Technology Inc. if you choose to do so.  Otherwise you can use the saved searches in the app for your own diagnosis.
If you do choose to submit your data to RTP Technology Inc., you will be contacted by an account representative who will schedule a follow up presentation whereby a RTP Consultant will review the Health Check results with you and/or your team.
Installation Instructions:

Install the app 
Open the app
You will be asked to configure the app on first run (if this is not the first run, you will need to click on setup)
Enter your contact details, and select the appropriate options
Click Save
Wait for Splunk to tell you a restart is needed, and then restart splunk
Thats it, Sending your data to RTP Technology is a one time automated process that occurs when you restart Splunk. 

After restarting, splunk will execute the saved searches and create lookups which are then sent to RTP Technology Inc., along with your contact details (assuming you agreed to the license, selected the options to send data and didn't select ""I dont have internet""). 
If you do not accept the license agreement or do not check a box to send any data, then no searches will execute and no data will be sent when you restart splunk.  
If you select ""I do not have internet"" then you must manually send the data found here, $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Splunk_TA_RTP-Health-Checker/lookups/offline_package.tar.gz, to RTP Technology. You can send it to Splunk@RTPTech.com or call (201) 796-2266 and ask to speak with someone on the Splunk team for more options or any other questions you may have.
As a final step to all of the above scenarios, when Splunk is restarted for the first time after installing the app, the scripted input will execute a python script that disables the scripted input. Except if you did not select to send any data, in which case the scripted input never gets enabled.
Troubleshooting:
The application logs to index=_internal.  You can find any errors or exceptions using this search: index=_internal rtp*.  If you do experience any difficulties, please contact us at Splunk@RTPTech.com or by telephone at (201) 796-2266.",Version 1.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/0848b3a8-5114-11e7-8d3f-02f13bdc2585.png,"IT Operations, Utilities",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,155,0,splunk,5,3,Michael Bentley,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/jkat54,"Products: Splunk Enterprise

The Splunk App for Quorum contains a set of dashboards and analytics to give you full visibility into the system metrics, application data and ledger so that you can maintain security, stability and performance for your Quorum deployment.  
These dashboards are meant to be a starting point for building analytics around your Quorum blockchain no matter where it is deployed.
In order to take full advantage of the dashboards provided there are 3 types of data sources that should be configured. Not all of these data sources are required to use the app, this is just a small taste of what is possible with Splunk and blockchain!

Quorum Blocks, Transactions, and Events - These logs contain transaction information from the ledger itself and provide insight into operations and actions on-chain. Weâve open sourced Splunk Connect for Ethereum to help you easily ingest Quorum ledgers in Splunk.
Quorum node logs and metrics - These are logs and metrics specific to a Quorum node. Specifically, Quorum application logs, Geth metrics, RPC data polled from different Quorum node endpoints (i.e. admin_peers, txpool_content, etc -- see Splunk Connect for Ethereum for more information).
Infrastructure/System Level Metrics and Logs - System metrics such as CPU,MEM,DISK and NETWORK activity provide insight into the underlying infrastructure Quorum nodes are running on.  These metrics/logs could come from physical machines, Docker, Kubernetes, IBM IKS, Microsoft Azure, Googleâs GCP and AWS Cloudwatch to name a few.  Splunk has different Add-ons and connectors for each.  

App Features
Dashboards
There are a few dashboards provided to get you started with analyzing your Quorum deployment. These include:
  * Data Setup - A dashboard to show you what data is being received by Splunk.
  * Raw Data Flow - A dashboard showing the data flowing in from each Quorum node and data source.
  * Infrastructure Health and Monitoring - An overview of system health from system metrics like CPU, uptime status as well as transaction latency. You can see in real time when transactions are starting to back up or a node is falling behind on blocks.
  * Transaction Analytics - Real time visibility into the transactions being written on the ledger. See a breakdown of private vs public transactions and analytics around addresses.
  * Ledger Query - Query the ledger using specific attributes to get detailed event data.
Getting Started


Automated Demo

The easiest way to test and demo the app is using the docker-compose Quorum example included with Splunk Connect for Ethereum.



Manual Setup

Install the App on a Splunk Enterprise Search Head that will have access to the data.  
Open the App and navigate to the âData Setupâ dashboard from the Introduction Page.
Follow the instructions for each of the 3 data sources on the âData Setupâ page in order to populate the graphs and validate data is coming in correctly. 



Quorum Block and Transaction Data - Splunk Connect for Ethereum is an open source agent that connects to each node on the Quorum network. See its README for deployment instructions. Docker, Kubernetes, and native deployments are all options.


Quorum node logs and metrics - You will need to create event and metric indexes in Splunk as well as an input mechanism to receive the data.  We usually like to create an index called âethereumâ and âmetricsâ and enable the Splunk HEC to receive data.  You can use the example âindexes.conf.exampleâ provided in the app.  Simply rename the file from âindexes.conf.exampleâ to âindexes.confâ to enable the indexes, and rename âinputs.conf.exampleâ to âinputs.confâ to enable the HEC endpoints. You will also need to enable the HTTP Event Collector (HEC) to receive data if it has not been ""enabled"" already.  




$ cd $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/splunk-app-quorum/default
$ sudo mv inputs.conf.example inputs.conf
$ sudo mv indexes.conf.example indexes.conf
$ cd /opt/splunk/bin
$ sudo ./splunk restart


Quorum node JSON-RPC data - Quorum nodes also have RPC endpoints that Splunk Connect for Ethereum can poll and send to Splunk. This can be used to monitor transaction pool activity on a node, active peers, or leader election in Raft or Istanbul. In order for this to work, the required endpoints need to be whitelisted on the Quorum node. See the README at Splunk Connect for Ethereum for more information.


System Logs/Metrics - Depending on how youâve deployed your Quorum network, there is probably a great option to get your System Logs and Metrics for end-to-end visibility. On the data setup dashboard, weâve provided a list of common options that you can use to get your data into Splunk. 


Below is a list of possible environments:
      - Docker: Splunk Docker Logging Driver
      - Kubernetes: Splunk Connect for Kubernetes
      - Syslog: Monitoring Network Ports in Splunk

Out of the box the app only shares its transforms.conf rules, tags, and descriptive lookup file globally. It applies the rules to the access_combined sourcetype within the app itself only - running a large set of complex regular expressions on a large number of events will seriously impact your search performance! To reduce unintended impact you have to use the search page within the Regex IDS app to test the rule set against your events. Searches run outside the app remain unaffected.
Regex IDS ships with the PHPIDS default rules set available at https://github.com/PHPIDS/PHPIDS/blob/master/lib/IDS/default_filter.json under LGPL.
In order to use your own rules set you can replace the file under $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/regex_ids/bin/default_filter.json while following the same JSON structure, running $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk cmd python etc/apps/regex_ids/bin/converter.py to generate props.conf, transforms.conf, tags.conf, and the accompanying lookup CSV, and restarting Splunk or hitting the debug/refresh endpoint to reload this search-time configuration.
This is intended as a starting point, not a one-click-solution.

Mainframes power mission-critical applications around the world. But many organizations are still flying blind, with no easy way to derive operational intelligence from the vast amounts of machine data generated by these critical systems.
Itâs time for data streams from the mainframe to be as accessible as your other data streams when it comes to analytics for business intelligence and security monitoring.
Syncsort Ironstream enables you to collect and forward z/OS log data, including security data, into Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Enterprise Security, where you can get that true 360-degree view.
Users can then easily search, analyze, and visualize the data for powerful business intelligence reporting -- without needing specialized expertise and different monitoring systems for z/OS.
Make more sense of the massive machine data piled up in your mainframe.

Installation Instructions

Download the app and unzip to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps on your Search Head
Restart Splunk
Generate a search that has a 'source', 'target' and optionally a count. 

Search Examples
Standard Source Destination Search



- index=firewall action=allowed
stats count by src_ip, dest_ip




Multi Relationship Mapping
This option allows you to add as many tiers of relationship mapping as neccessary.  Ensure that the number format is in XX rather than X.  For example node1 will not work, but node01 will work.
- index=firewall action=allowed | stats count by src_ip, dest_ip, dest_port | rename src_ip as node00, dest_ip as node01, dest_port as node03
- index=os | stats count by hardware, operatingsystem, asset_name | rename hardware as node00, operatingsystem as node01, asset_name as node03
- Tested up to 5 nodes.  
Configuration Options
Format

Theme Color - Changes background image color
Arrows - Enables direction arrows in force directed visualization
Line Stroke Width - Changes the width of the lines connecting nodes
Link Highlight Length - This number affects how many node children are higlighted when you mouseover a node.  i.e If you select '2' and hover over a node. Its connected nodes are highlighted and children of those.
Circle Radius - This will change the size in pixels of the circle
Pan/Zoom - This will enable pan/zoom.  Defaults to disable and is best used with embedded reports.

Force Configuration

Attract Force Strength - Strength of Attracting forces. 
Attract Distance Max - The maximum distance over which attraction force acts. If two nodes exceed distanceMax, they will not exert forces on each other.
Attract Distance Min - The minimum distance over which attraction force acts. If two nodes are close than distanceMin, the exerted forces will be as if they are distanceMin apart.
Repel Force Strength - Strength of Repelling force
Repel Distance Max - The maximum distance over which repel force acts. If two nodes exceed distanceMax, they will not exert forces on each other.
Repel Distance Min - The minimum distance over which repel force acts. If two nodes exceed distanceMax, they will not exert forces on each other.
Link Distance - The shortest distance between nodes in a link.

Collision Configuration

Collision Strength - How strict collision mechanism is
Collision Radius - The radius between a center of each node that can't be overlapped with each other
Force Collide - Superfluous setting
Collision Iterations - The number of times to

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2655,2022-01-10,08:12:45 AM,DECRYPT,,"Feb. 16, 2021","Installation
DECRYPT is a standard Splunk App and requires no special configuration.

Usage
DECRYPT is implemented as a single search command which exposes a number of data manipulation functions. It takes the required field to manipulate and then one or more functions as arguments.
Usage: decrypt [field=<name>] FUNCTIONS...
The following example will transform the sourcetype field into its hex representation:
... | decrypt field=sourcetype hex() emit('sourcetype')

Note: Fields must be output via the emit function. The input field is not modified in place.

Arguments
field
The field argument specifies the Splunk field to use as input.
... | decrypt field=""hostname"" ...

If no field argument is passed then _raw will be used by default.
If a field argument is passed and the field does not exist in the current record being processed, no error or warning will be given.
FUNCTIONS
Each function passed as an argument will be executed in order, with the output of the previous function provided as input to the next.
... | decrypt field=hostname b64 xor('s\x65cr\x65t') hex emit('decrypted')

The above example can be explained as:

Pass the value of the hostname field to b64 as input
Pass the output of b64 to xor as input with the argument 's\x65cr\x65t'
Pass the output of xor to hex as input
Pass the output of hex to emit with the argument 'decrypted'


Functions
btoa()
Encodes input to a Base64 string.
b64(), atob()
Decodes a Base64 encoded string.
b32()
Decodes a Base32 encoded string.
rotx(count)
Implements Caesarian shift. The count argument specifies the amount to shift and must be an integer.
rol(count)
Implements rotate-on-left to each character within the string using an 8 bit boundary. The count argument specifies the amount to rotate and must be an integer.
ror(count)
Implements rotate-on-right to each character within the string using an 8 bit boundary. The count argument specifies the amount to rotate and must be an integer.
xor(key)
Implements basic XOR cipher against the field with the supplied key. The key can be provided as a string or integer.
rc4(key)
Implements the RC4 cipher against the field with the supplied key. The key provided must be a string.
hex()
Transforms input into its hexadecimal representation.
unhex()
Transforms hexadecimal input into its byte form.
save(name)
Saves the current state to memory as name.
load(name)
Recalls the previously saved state name from memory.
ascii()
Transforms input into ASCII output. Non-printable characters will be replaced with a period.
emit(name)
Outputs the current state as UTF-8 to the field name.
substr(offset, count)
Returns a substring of the input, starting at the index offset with the number of characters count.

Function Arguments
Strings
Strings can be specified by encapsulating values in apostrophes (single quote). Strings accept Pythonic escape sequences, so hexadecimal and octal values can be specified with \xhh and \ooo respectively.
'This is a valid string'
'This is also \x61 valid string.'

Quotation marks (double quotes) cannot be used.
""This is not a valid string""

Integers
Integers can be specified numerically or as hexadecimal representations by prefixing values with a 0x.
The value 256 could be passed as is or as its hexadecimal representation 0x100.
Field References
The value of Splunk fields can be used in function parameters by passing the field name as an argument. All referenced fields must be complete words unbroken by whitespace.
... | decrypt field=_raw xor(sourcetype) ...

The above example demonstrates passing the sourcetype field as the key to the xor function.
Fields saved using the save command can also be referenced.
... | decrypt field=_raw substr(0,1) save('1byte') substr(1, 4096) xor(1byte) ...

Style
Functions which take no arguments do not need parenthesis in order for syntax checking to pass. The following examples will pass syntax checks and execute the same.
... | decrypt field=_raw b64 hex unhex
... | decrypt field=_raw b64() hex() unhex()
... | decrypt field=_raw b64() hex unhex

New lines can be used to break up command sequences for easier readability.
... | decrypt field=_raw
      b64
      hex
      unhex


Recipes
XOR
... | decrypt field=data xor('secret') emit('result')

ROT13 cipher
... | decrypt field=data rotx(13) emit('result')

Base64 decode, XOR
... | decrypt field=data b64 xor('secret') emit('result')

Base64 decode, XOR with first byte
... | decrypt field=data
      b64
      save('bin')
      substr(0, 1) emit('key')
      load('bin')
      substr(1, 9999) xor(key) emit('result')

Brute force RC4
... | decrypt field=data
      b64
      save('orig') rc4('secret') emit('rc4-secret')
      load('orig') rc4('password') emit('rc4-password')
      load('orig') rc4('abc123') emit('rc4-abc123')
      load('orig') rc4('aabbccdd') emit('rc4-aabbccdd')

Brute force XOR key
... | decrypt field=data
      b64
      save('data') xor(0x01) emit('xor0x01')
      load('data') xor(0x02) emit('xor0x02')
      load('data') xor(0x03) emit('xor0x03')
      ...

    JSON Configuration (USA - Dallas, Texas): { ""city"": ""Dallas"", ""country"": ""TX"" }
Searching Data
Here are a few ways to search for your new Weather Data.
The default sourcetype is wunderground, and each input has it's own source in the style of wunderground:. Each different Wunderground API feature presents its data differently, but all of it is returned in JSON. The TA-wunderground automatically extracts the fields, so here are few examples with that knowledge.
Time Chart Some Stuff
Assuming you are using the api feature ""conditions"" here is a quick search that timecharts some of the returned data.
sourcetype=wunderground source=wunderground:city-conditions |timechart span=1h avg(relative_humidity) as RH avg(temp_f) as ""Temp(f)"" avg(wind_mph) as ""Wind Speed (mph)""

Here is a search for a ""current conditions"" dashboard
sourcetype=wunderground source=wunderground:city-conditions|tail 1|stats latest(relative_humidity) as RH latest(current_observation.temp_f) as ""Temp (F)""

And here's one for fun! (Thanks jspears!)

Setup and Install
This TA is deployed on Forwarders, Indexers and Search Heads.
Indexer
This TA can be deployed to the indexer without any further changes.
It is recommended to create a new index called cacti.  An indexes.conf file is not included with this TA.
Search Head
Install and Deploy the app to the search head.
On the search head, the add-on will provide:
 * search time extractions, lookups, macros and event types
To complete the install, you will need to update the follow:
 * macros.conf
   * cacti_index: replace index=cacti with the appropriate index
Cacti Server / Universal Forwarder
To complete the ingestion of data, deploy the Splunk_TA_Cacti to the forwarder installed on the same host as your Cacti implementation.  If you have multiple installs, you can deploy it across multiple Cacti servers.
For this add-on to work, you will need to have installed the Cacti Mirage plugin to the Cacti servers.  
Cacti Mirage: http://docs.cacti.net/userplugin:mirage
Cacti Mirage Github: https://github.com/n00badmin/mirage
In addition, you will need the following information:
 * Path to Cacti install (i.e. /var/www/html/cacti or /usr/share/cacti)
 * Path to mirage_poller_output.log (i.e /var/www/html/cacti/log/mirage_poller_output.log)
 * Index to send data to (either default or index=cacti, etc)
For deploying the add-on, copy the following files from the default directory to the local directory.
 * inputs.conf
Edit the local/inputs.conf file and make the following changes:
 * enable all inputs stanzas: change disabled = true to disabled = false
 * modify all stanzas to reflect the appropriate destination index (i.e. index=cacti)
 * [monitor:///usr/share/cacti/log/mirage_poller_output.log*]
    * Set to the correct path to the mirage_poller_output.log file.  This file is generated by the Cacti Mirage plugin
 * [monitor:///usr/share/cacti/log/cacti.log]
    * Set to the correct path to the cacti.log file, which is most likely in the log/ folder inside the Cacti install.
 * [script://./bin/cacti_lookup_mirage.py /usr/share/cacti]
    * Change /usr/share/cacti to the folder where you installed Cacti",Version 1.0.1,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/5b664446-c6ce-11e5-81fc-0a2568125881.png,"IT Operations, Utilities",http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html,591,0,splunk,5,6,Menno Vanderlist,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/mvanderlist_splunk,"Products: Splunk Enterprise

Release Notes
v1.9.0 - Now Splunk Cloud supported!   Updated using Add-On-Builder 4.0 to set python version preference to python3 and pass cloud vetting (no changes in functionality).
Prerequisites

AppDynamics Collector URL (host & port)
AppDynamics User ID, Password
AppDynamics Account Name

Installation Instructions
Install the Splunk Add-on for AppDynamics on a heavy forwarder for data collection. The app contains modular inputs for data collection and requires Python. 
Install the Splunk Add-on for AppDynamics to your search heads to enable search time operations.  
(Optional) Install the Splunk App for AppDynamics on your search heads. The add-on is responsible for executing the REST calls and collecting the data from AppDynamics. The app provides the dashboards and saved searches. If you are using this add-on together with the Splunk ITSI Module for Application Performance Monitoring, only the add-on is necessary for integration.
Standard Configuration
The Splunk Add-on for AppDynamics contains three input types:
 - AppDynamics Summary
 - Single API Call
 - AppDynamics Analytics API
In most cases you will only need to use the AppDynamics Summary input.
If you are using this add-on together with the Splunk ITSI Module for Application Performance Monitoring, set your data collection interval to less than 300 seconds.
Start Searching
Once the Splunk Add-on for AppDynamics is installed and configured you can execute searches using:
sourcetype=""appdynamics_summary""
Note: If your data is stored in an index that is not searched by default for your Splunk user, you will need to add the specific index to the Selected indexes in Access controls > Roles > [ROLE NAME]
Additional Optional Configuration
In some cases you may not want all of the Summary data or you may only need a very specifc metric for a single application. For these cases, use the AppDynamics API input type. In this case, you will also need to specify an application name, the url path and the specific metric path found in the AppDynamics Metric Browser. 

While in the AppDynamics Metric Browser, identify the metric you would like to capture and right-click to copy the ""Full Path"". This is the value you will use for an AppDynamics API data input.
Click the Configure New Input button and select AppDynamics API 
Enter your API call parameters and save
Now start searching using

sourcetype=""appdynamics:api""
AppDynamics Analytics Events API Call
This input provides the ability to query data from AppDynamics Analytics Events API.  The inputs are very different from the other 2 inputs.   This input requires your 'Global Account Name' as well an API Key to access the data.  More details 
More details on this API can be found here:

Splunk app with security alerts to generate detections via Microsoft Sysmon and Windows Event Logs
This app provides alerts built with splunk search macros to detect a wide variety of suspicious activity in Windows environment. It is designed for 'blue-team' team members to identify suspicious activity in Windows environment.
Design
The app consists of a number of search macros which are also used in Splunk alerts to raise Triggered alerts. The macros are listed in Advanced Search > Search Macros with sysmon_detect_* being the detection rules leveraging Sysmon and Windows Event logs.
Other macros include:
 sysmon_search - Base search used to search Sysmon logs. Used across most detection rules. 
 winlog_search - Base search used to search Windows Event logs. Used across most detection rules.
 sysmon_rename_fields - Search used to rename/create new fields in Sysmon. Used across most detection rules.
 sysmon_rename_fields - Search used to rename/create new fields in Windows Event Logs. Used across most detection rules.
* sysmon_create_alert - Search used to add an alert to a lookup table. The fields in lookup table are based on Mitre Attack Framework
Setup
Install the app via Splunk Manage App.
Ensure that the Sysmon logs and Windows Event logs are enabled from relevant universal forwarder. 
Refer to this guide on how to forward Sysmon Logs to Splunk.
Refer to this guide on how to forward Windows Event Logs to Splunk.
By default, the app searches index=main for sourcetype=WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational (Sysmon logs) and sourcetype=WinEventLog:* (Windows Event logs).
If that is not the case, update the sysmon_search and winlog_search search macros with the log locations.
Detections
Currently, the following detections (as search macros / alerts) have been been added to this splunk app: 
 sysmon_detect_adhunttool - Detects ADHunt tool
 sysmon_detect_windows_powershell_suspicious_command_exec - Detects strings that contain suspicious powershell patterns typically associated with malware
 sysmon_detect_windows_powershell_long_command_exec - Detects very long powershell strings typically associated with malware
 sysmon_detect_windows_network_connections_beaconing - Detects regular outbound network connections/beacons
 sysmon_detect_windows_dns_connections_beaconing - Detects regular windows DNS connections/beacons

Summary Documentation
Custom Commands
bs4
Description
A wrapper for BeautifulSoup4 to extract html/xml tags and text from them to use in Splunk. A wrapper script to bring some functionality from BeautifulSoup to Splunk. Default is to get the text and send it to a new field 'get_text', otherwise the selection is returned in a field named 'soup'. Default is to use the 'lxml' parser, though you can specify others, 'html5lib' is not currently included. The find methods can be used in conjuction, their order of operation is find > find_all > find_child > find children. Each option has a similar named option appended '_attrs' that will accept inner and outer quoted key:value pairs for more precise selections.
Syntax
*| bs4 textfield=<field> [get_text=<bool>] [get_text_label=<string>] [get_attr=<attribute_name_string>] [parser=<string>] [find=<tag>] [find_attrs=<quoted_key:value_pairs>] [find_all=<tag>] [find_all_attrs=<quoted_key:value_pairs>] [find_child=<tag>] [find_child_attrs=<quoted_key:value_pairs>] [find_children=<tag>] [find_children_attrs=<quoted_key:value_pairs>]
cleantext
Description
Tokenize and normalize text (remove punctuation, digits, change to base_word). Different options result in better and slower cleaning. base_type=""lemma_pos"" being the slowest option, base_type=""lemma"" assumes every word is a noun, which is faster but still results in decent lemmatization. Many fields have a default already set, textfield is only required field. By default results in a multi-valued field which is ready for used with stats count by. Optionally return special fields for analysis--pos_tags and ngrams.
Syntax
*| cleantext textfield=<field> [keep_orig=<bool>] [default_clean=<bool>] [remove_urls=<bool>] [remove_stopwords=<bool>] [base_word=<bool>] [base_type=<string>] [mv=<bool>] [force_nltk_tokenize=<bool>] [pos_tagset=<string>] [custom_stopwords=<comma_separated_string_list>] [term_min_len=<int>] [ngram_range=<int>-<int>] [ngram_mix=<bool>]
similarity
Description
A wrapper for NTLK distance metrics for comparing text to use in Splunk. Similarity (and distance) metrics can be used to tell how far apart to pieces of text are and in some algorithms return also the number of steps to make the text the same. These do not extract meaning, but are often used in text analytics to discover plagurism, conduct fuzzy searching, spell checking, and more. Defaults to using the Levenshtein distance algorithm but includes several other algorithms (Damerau-Levenshtein, Jaro, Jaro-Winkler), including some set based algorithms (Jaccard, MASI). Can handle multi-valued comparisons with an option to limit to a given number of top matches. Multi-valued output can be zipped together or returned seperately.
Syntax
*| similarity textfield=<field> comparefield=<field> [algo=<string>] [limit=<int>] [mvzip=<bool>]
vader
Description
Sentiment analysis using Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner. Using option full_output will return scores for neutral, positive, and negative which are the scores that make up the compound score (that is just returned as the field ""sentiment"". Best to feed in uncleaned data as it takes into account capitalization and punctuation.
Syntax
* | vader textfield=sentence [full_output=<bool>]
ML Algorithms
TruncantedSVD
Description
From sklearn. Used for dimension reduction (especially on a TFIDF). This is also known in text analytics as Latent Semantic Analysis or LSA. Returns fields prepended with ""SVD_"". See http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.TruncatedSVD.html
Syntax
fit TruncatedSVD <fields> [into <model name>] k=<int>
 The k option sets the number of components to change the data into. It is important that the value is less than the number of features or documents. The documentation on the algorithm recommends to be set to at least 100 for LSA.
LatentDirichletAllocation
Description
From sklearn. Used for dimension reduction. This is also known as LDA. Returns fields prepended with ""LDA_"". See http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.LatentDirichletAllocation.html
Syntax
fit LatentDirichletAllocation <fields> [into <model name>] k=<int>
 The k option sets the number of components (topics) to change the data into. It is important that the value is less than the number of features or documents. 
NMF
Description
From sklearn. Used for dimension reduction. This is also known as Non-Negative Matrix Factorization. Returns fields prepended with ""NMF_"". See http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.NMF.html
Syntax
fit NMF <fields> [into <model name>] [k=<int>]
 The k option sets the number of components (topics) to change the data into. It is important that the value is less than the number of features or documents. 
TFBinary
Description
A modified implemenation of TfidfVectorizer from sklearn. The current MLTK version has TfidfVectorizer but it does not allow the option of turning off IDF or setting binary to True. This is to create a document-term matrix of whether the document has the given term or not. See http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html
Syntax
fit TFBinary <fields> [into <model name>] [max_features=<int>] [max_df=<int>] [min_df=<int>] [ngram_range=<int>-<int>] [analyzer=<str>] [norm=<str>] [token_pattern=<str>] [stop_words=english] [use_idf=<true|false>] [binary=<true|false>]
 In this implementation, the following settings are already set in order to create a binary output: use_idf is set to False, binary has been set to True, and norm has been set to None. The rest of the settings and options are exactly like the MLTK implementation.
MinMaxScaler
Description
From sklearn. Transforms each feature to a given range. Returns fields prepended with ""MMS_"". See http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html
Syntax
fit MinMaxScaler <fields> [into <model name>] [copy=<true|false>] [feature_range=<int>-<int>]
 Default feature_range=0-1 copy=true.
LinearSVC
Description
From sklearn. Similar to SVC with parameter kernel=âlinearâ, but implemented in terms of liblinear rather than libsvm, so it has more flexibility in the choice of penalties and loss functions and should scale better to large numbers of samples. See http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.LinearSVC.html
Syntax
fit LinearSVC <fields> [into <model name>] [gamma=<int>] [C=<int>] [tol=<int>] [intercept_scaling=<int>] [random_state=<int>] [max_iter=<int>] [penalty=<l1|l2>] [loss=<hinge|squared_hinge>] [multi_class=<ovr|crammer_singer>] [dual=<true|false>] [fit_intercept=<true|false>]
 The C option sets the penalty parameter of the error term.
ExtraTreesClassifier
Description
From sklearn. This class implements a meta estimator that fits a number of randomized decision trees (a.k.a. extra-trees) on various sub-samples of the dataset and use averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. See http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier.html
Syntax
fit ExtraTreesClassifier <fields> [into <model name>] [random_state=<int>] [n_estimators=<int>] [max_depth=<int>] [max_leaf_nodes=<int>] [max_features=<int|auto|sqrt|log|None>] [criterion=<gini|entropy>]
 The n_estimators option sets the number of trees in the forest, defaults to 10.

In more detail you can use the app to: 
- Predict potential outages using an improved workflow for generating predictive health scores in ITSI; 
- Determine similarity between different services using graph analytics, and use the similarity to generate episodes; 
- Identify root cause from episodes by analysing the relationships between the affected services and the KPIs they rely on; and 
- Help configure your KPI importance by presenting insights around the correlation between a service health score and the KPIs it relies on.
Dashboards
ITSI Predictive Analytics Workflow
Using this dashboard you can select a service to initiate the predictive analytics workflow. On selecting a service you will be taken to the service analysis section of the workflow where you can see some reports about the behaviour of the service. Progressing on from the service analysis section takes you to the correlation analysis stage, where the KPIs the service relies on are compared against the future health score. If the correlation analysis identifies good predictive indicators in the data for the service health score then you will be able to progress to the final stage of the workflow where you can train a set of predictive models and a recommendation will be made as to the most performant model for your data. If there is not good correlation in your data you can look at the ITSI KPI Assessment dashboard to see if tuning your KPI importance may lead to better results.
ITSI Service Tree Analysis
This dashboard allows you to analyse your service models using a label propagation algorithm. This algorithm will identify similar types of services based on the connections across all of the service trees in ITSI. The identified groups can be saved as a lookup, which can then be used to enrich your correlation search results and ultimately be used to group alerts into episodes.
ITSI Episode Analysis
On this dashboard you can view the episodes in ITSI and when clicking on an episode in the table root cause analysis against will be run to see the KPIs that appear to have the most impact on the services affected by the episode. Once the analysis is complete you can click on the root cause analysis table to view the episode in deep dive, where the service health score and root cause KPIs will be presented to you. 
ITSI KPI Assessment
On this dashboard you can select a service to analyse, and the panels will present the results of some correlation and causation analysis. Depending on the results of the analysis the dashboard may make some recommendations about how you could tune your KPI importance weights.
Macros
The app contains a single macro `predict_health_score(4)`, which expects four arguments: the id of the KPI you are predicting, the id of the KPI with hyphens replaced with underscores, a list of the KPIs used to make the prediction and the initials of the algorithm used to make the prediction. This macro is used in the predictive workflow section of the app.

Overview
This TA provides and external Python lookup that parses User Agents strings, such as those found in Web or Proxy logs.
Installation
To install:
1. Untar the tarball file in your $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps
   directory.
2. Restart Splunk.
Usage
The lookup expects a field in the events (http_user_agent). Once that field exists (via extractions, alias or rename). Once that field exists, you can use it in a lookup command, as such:
    index=web_proxy | lookup user_agents http_user_agent
The lookup will output the following fields:
  * ua_os_family: The name of the client OS.
  * ua_os_major: The major version of the client OS.
  * ua_os_minor: The minor version of the client OS.
  * ua_os_patch: The patch version of the client OS.
  * ua_os_patch_minor: The minor patch version of the client OS.
  * ua_family: The name of the UA (""Firefox"", ""IE"")
  * ua_major: The major version of the UA.
  * ua_minor: The minor version of the UA.
  * ua_patch: The patch version of the UA
  * ua_device: The type of device used in the event.
Customization
To add your own user agents, you can use the YAML file in TA-user-agents/bin/ua_parser/ named regexes.yaml.

Usage of the Funct command is relatively easy and works particularly well after a transforming command such as stats. Running the Funct commands requires that you specify the command (obviously), a source field, and output field. Optionally, you can specify a character limit. The default character limit is the first 1000 characters of a string. 

Use case(s):
Username formatting:
Truly determine the number of different username formats that are floating around on your network. The following query will quickly show you policy vs. reality when it comes to username naming conventions.
| tstats count FROM datamodel=Authentication WHERE Authentication.user=* NOT Authentication.user=*$* by Authentication.user

This Add-On Requires the user to download and install the SplunkStart App
from Splunkbase. It is at: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3577/
After installing SplunkStart, you can use this TA.
Installing the TA
Unpack the downloaded TA in whatever directory it is found in. Then from the command line, cd to the SplunkStart/bin directory. It is located in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SplunkStart/bin.
Run the script from the bin directory of SplunkStart:
./create_content.sh <path to directory of this TA>

Example:
./create_content.sh ~/Downloads/TA_SplunkStart_New_Dashboards

This will append the necessary files from the TA to the local directory and the default.meta in the TA to SplunkStart's metadata/local.meta directory. The titles files will also be copied from the TA to the src/titles directory
IMPORTANT: From command line, run cp <pathway to TA directory>/TA_SplunkStart_New_Dashboards/appserver/static/sw_* $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SplunkStart/appserver/static/. (make sure you include the . after the static/)
This is needed to copy the .js and .css files needed in 3 of the dashboard panels. 

Example: 
cp ~/Downloads/TA_SplunkStart/New_Dashboards/appserver/static/sw_* /Applications/Splunk/etc/apps/SplunkStart/appserver/static. 

Alternatively, just copy the .js and .css files in the appserver -> static folder of the TA into the appserver -> static of SplunkStart
You must now restart Splunk. Once it's up, go to the Web interface of Splunk and do a https://localhost:8000/en-US/_bump
Usage:
Go into the the SplunkStart App from SplunkWeb. Click on Configure Splunk Start App->Modify Dashboard Macros and notice that there are 10 new tabs. Within these 10 tabs, there are 36 macros that you can modify to use your own data with the TA. The common fields you would enter are your index name, your sourcetype, earliest time (-15m, -1d, -2Y, etc) and latest time (now). Some of the dashboard panels require you to download other apps-- to get the full functionality of this TA, download from Splunkbase:
Waterfall Graph
Calender Heat Map
Boxplot Viz
Location Tracker
Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit
Punchcard Viz

Status Indicator Viz
For more information about each of the macros and what fields you need to enter, go to the src folder within TA_SplunkStart_New_Dashboards -> macros folder -> macros_new_dashboards.txt 
Note that unlike SplunkStart and the SplunkStart Basic Security Essentials TA, the formatting for the panels are NOT found in the saved search, but rather in the dashboard XML. This means that the search and macro themselves are not associated with the chart type and formatting (in most cases) and that the XML is necessary in order to get the desired appearance of each panel. Changing the macro/saved search will not impact the XML, however, so you can make whatever changes and additions to macros that you want and the formatting of the panel will remain the same. You can also copy the XML and use it for dashboards not in this app! 
Some of the dashboard panel formatting (ie, XML) is taken from Splunk Dashboard Examples or Splunk demo

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3503,2022-01-10,08:13:40 AM,Internet Registry Lookup,,"Dec. 9, 2021","What does it do?
This add-on provides a lookup of all the public Internet subnets in the world. This includes IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. You can perform a CIDR lookup of any public IP address and know what subnet it is associated with at the regional Internet registry (RIR). The add-on provides an automatic mechanism to update this lookup.
What does it not do?
It does not replace iplocation, though it does give the country code when available. It does not identify the assignee by name, only by registration ID. There is no lookup available for these registration IDs, but it is possible (and sometimes useful) to search for ranges with the same registration ID. It does not give information about sub-assignments within ranges, only the direct assignments from the RIR.
Why would I want to use this?
If you ever wanted to know what subnet to block based on abuse or other undesirable traffic from one or more hosts, this add-on will quickly tell you what subnet anything on the Internet is on without having to manually look it up at the registry. If you ever wanted to monitor or measure traffic based on subnet, organization (resource holder ID) or country, this add-on can help you do it.
Where does it get its data?
Updates come directly from each RIR via HTTP. Each of the five registries maintains 'extended statistics' files for their address spaces.
IPv4 is assigned/allocated by range, not subnet. How does this add-on handle that?
CIDR lookup is only by subnet, thus this add-on breaks ranges down into a minimal set of subnets. Ranges that span multiple subnets represent a minority of IPv4 assignments and allocations.
Why include 'available' or 'reserved' ranges?
Sometimes, traffic mysteriously comes from address spaces that are not allocated or assigned.
How much of my license will this use?
None. The RIR data does not go into an index, only a lookup table. Splunk only indexes the Python script status events, and they go into the unmetered internal index (_internal).
Thatâs a lot of CSV data. Why not use the KV Store?
CIDR lookups against the KV Store are slow. Really, really slow.
Where is the documentation?

The Splunk for Snort app provides field extractions for Snort alert logs (fast and full) as well as dashboards, saved searches, reports, event types, tags and event search interfaces. It is compliant with the Splunk Common Information Model.
This app is maintained by Patrik Nordlen. Suggestions and bug reports are appreciated.
Installation
To install, extract the .spl file in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps
You will need to enable the appropriate inputs, either via inputs.conf, or through the Manager in the Splunk GUI. Splunk for Snort expects full alert logs to have a sourcetype of ""snort_alert_full"" and fast alert logs to have a sourcetype of ""snort_alert_fast"". Note that you don't need both types, any one will do - these distinctions are only there to make sure that Splunk parses the logs correctly. Sourcetypes are renamed to ""snort"" at search time, so if you do have both full and fast logs you won't need to worry about searching separately for each corresponding sourcetype.
Using Splunk for Snort
Field extractions
The most basic feature provided by this app is to extract fields from Snort logs. The following fields are extracted for both full and fast:

src_ip (Source IP address)
dest_ip (Destination IP address)
src_port (Source port)
dest_port (Destination port)
proto (Network protocol)
generator_id (ID value of the Snort generator)
signature (SID value of the signature)
signature_rev (Signature revision)
interface (Network interface)
name (Signature name)
category (Signature category)
classification (Signature classification)
priority (Signature priority)

The following fields are extracted for full only (as they are not available in fast):

ttl (Packet TTL)
tos (Type of Service)
id (Unique ID for the event)
iplen (Packet IP header length)
dgmlen (Packet total length)
bytes_in (Packet total length)

These field extractions are applied to all logs with sourcetype ""snort"" (which includes sourcetypes ""snort_alert_fast"" and ""snort_alert_full"" as they are renamed to ""snort"" at search time).
Snort event search
The app includes a custom search interface for Snort events, available under ""Snort event search"". This interface shows events tables and statistics for issued searches.
Dashboards and reports
A number of dashboards and reports are provided containing the most common information that is usually requested.
Map view
Splunk for Snort provides a dashboard for viewing geographical location of source IPs that have triggered alerts. This map is populated through a scheduled search that runs every hour.
PLEASE NOTE THAT TO VIEW THIS MAP YOU NEED THE MAXMIND APP:

The goal of this tool is very simple: It brings all the Information you need to create CIM compliance TA or check an existent TA at one single point. ThatÂ´s one main problem, to find all needed information because they are widely scattered, but the SA CIM developers do a great job and documented they work right in the data models. In addition, the apparently confusing logic of the CIM makes it hard to find a clear way to find all the relevant field mappings. The funny story is that CIM tries to normalize the Information and itself is full of redundancies und and double field names with different meanings. Of course, there is a leeway between being precise and a global view. This tool can help you balancing on the line.The CIM Buddy shows you which fields are relevant while you develop a TA with CIM compatibility and present the result of your development. You can examine if your fields are mapped correctly, if tagging works or what the SA CIM searches write into the data model.Watch the Walk Through in the main app folder.",Version 1.2.2,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/00a66656-6ca1-11ec-aa0d-ee63f89816e1.png,Utilities,https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,30,0,splunk,0,0,Christian Lauber,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/clauber,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

The app contains detailed installation instructions. We can provide installation support tailored to your needs if needed.
This app consists of:
- Technology Addon for Universal Forwarders (TA)
- Technology Addon for Indexers (TA)
- Supporting Addon for search head(s) (SA)
If you run in a distributed environment, The UF TA's should be deployed to the Universal Forwarders, preferably via the Deployment server. The indexer TA's can be installed on the indexers by hand, a cluster master or a deployment server. The Supporting addons should go on the search heads manually or via the deployer if you run a SHC.
The UF TA's on your endpoints execute the actual test suites and forward their results via the testrunner framework in a HEC-compatible format to a Splunk HEC endpoint. The Indexer TA's have a sample configuration for such an endpoint. If you already have infrastructure for a HEC endpoint, you can configure the testrunner to use that instead.
If you want to monitor endpoints that don't (or can't) run a Universal Forwarder then you can deploy the UF TA's via other means such as Ansible or Puppet. By executing the testrunner binary via something like cron, the test suites will be executed and the results will still be sent to the HEC endpoint, even though there's no UF installed.
The testrunner framework is open and will execute any test suite that you deploy alongside the UF TA's so it's easy to expand the existing test suites and even add completely new ones. Although this app is meant for endpoint compliance, it's easy to expand the scope to things such as ITSI metrics and other business data.",,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/df1e57d0-a0ca-11ea-ba1f-066424d922ac.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance",,34,0,splunk,0,0,SMT Simple management technologies,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/smt_nl,

Product Configuration

Proofpoint on Demand (PoD): PoD Log API service requires Remote Syslog Forwarding license. Please refer this document on how to enable and check PoD Log API: https://proofpointcommunities.force.com/community/s/article/Proofpoint-on-Demand-Pod-Log-APIÂ 

Deployment
Single Server Deployment:
In a single server deployment, single instance of Splunk Enterprise functions as data collection node, indexer and search head. In such deployment, install Proofpoint On Demand Email Security Add-on and Proofpoint TAP SIEM Modular Input. After that, install Proofpoint On Demand Email Security App.
Distributed Deployment
In a distributed deployment, typically a combination of forwarders are deployed for data collection, separate indexer nodes for data ingestion and search heads for data visualization are deployed. We recommend installing our TA's on both Forwarder and Search heads and the App on the search head.

Proofpoint on Demand configuration
Contact Proofpoint support to enable PoD Log API capability. This requires Remote syslog license on your deployment.
Make sure you have the Cluster ID and API Key before you start configuring the Add-on. The cluster ID can be found top right corner of your Proofpoint on Demand admin console and it looks like customername_hosted. The API key is a long series of 200+ alpha numeric characters. Optionally you can check if the API key is valid using a curl command. Here is an example:
curl -i --no-buffer -k  -v -H ""Connection: Upgrade"" -H ""Upgrade: websocket"" -H ""Host: logstream.proofpoint.com:443"" -H ""Authorization: Bearer <APIKEY>"" -H ""Sec-WebSocket-Key: SGVsbG8sIHdvcmxkIQ=="" -H ""Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13"" ""https://logstream.proofpoint.com:443/v1/stream?cid=<cluster-id>&type=message""

Splunk Configuration
There are two steps to configure the Proofpoint On Demand Email Security Add-on. First, configure an account profile that would be used to connect to Proofpoint Log service. Second, configure mail and message inputs that would use the configured account profile to download logs and tokenize them. Here are the detailed steps:

From the Splunk home page, click on ""Proofpoint On Demand Email Security Add On""
Click on the ""Configuration"" tab
Add button
Give an ""Account Profile"" name. For example, podlogapi
For ""Cluster ID"" input your cluster name.
For the ""API Key"" please past the API as received from Proofpoint. Please make sure to not add space or special character at the end of the API key.

Now that the account profile is created, next let's create input types.

From the ""Proofpoint On Demand Email Security Add On"" app context, select the ""Inputs"" tab
Select ""Create New Input"" on the right side, and select ""Proofpoint Mail Log""
On the next screen, for ""Name"" give a name for this log. For example, pps_mail_log
Retry Interval, use 60 seconds. Please note that this retry setting is only used when the connection is lost. It's not a polling frequency as the logs are pushed using websocket from Proofpoint.
For ""Index"", select the index you want the logs to be available on.
For ""Account Profile"" select the account profile from previous step.
Follow steps 2-6 again and create ""Proofpoint Message Log"" input type. Make sure the use the same index for both input types.

Verification
The Proofpoint On Demand logs are collected by the source type pps_maillog and pps_messagelog. In the search box you can verify the logs by searching for sourcetype=""pps_maillog"" and sourcetype=""pps_messagelog"". Note, if the sourcetypes are not created, that means there were no logs downloaded after the inputs were created.",Version 2.0.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/834318a6-b8bc-11ea-806a-02fa7700cf1c.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/30427798_proofpoint_data_license_agreement_december_2015.pdf,"3,652",0,splunk,3,2,Proofpoint Splunk Integrations,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/proofpointsplunkintegrations,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

The Cisco CMX App for Splunk runs searches on indexed data and builds dashboards using it. It provides different dashboards to get insight into CMX data.
REQUIREMENTS

Splunk version >= 6.3

Recommended System configuration


Splunk forwarder system should have 4 GB of RAM and a quad-core CPU to run this app smoothly.


Application can work on both Windows and Linux platforms.


Topology and Setting up Splunk Environment

This app has been distributed in two parts.

1) Add-on app, which runs collector scripts and gathers data from CMX devices, does indexing on it and provides indexed data to the Main app.
  2) The main app, which receives indexed data from Add-on app, runs searches on it and builds a dashboard using indexed data.


This App can be set up in two ways:
  1) Standalone Mode: Install the main app and Add-on app on a single machine.

Here both the app resides on a single machine.
The main app uses the data collected by Add-on app and builds dashboard on it



2) Distributed Environment: Install the main app and Add-on app on search head, Only Add-on on forwarder system and indexes.conf file from Add-on bundle on Indexer.
 * Here also both the apps resides on search head machine, but no need to configure Add-on on search head.
 * Only Add-on needs to be installed and configured on forwarder system.
 * Execute the following command on forwarder to forward the collected data to the indexer.
   $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk add forward-server <indexer_ip_address>:9997
 * On Indexer machine, enable event listening on port 9997 (recommended by Splunk).
 * The main app on search head uses the received data and builds dashboards on it.

Installation of App

This app can be installed through UI using ""Manage Apps"" or extract zip file directly into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ folder.
We have to setup the RESTSERVER ip , port , username and password to fetch image from the server for ""Floor Activity Map"" dashboard - (Optional Process)

External Data Source

This application fetches floor images from CMX device via REST API.

OPEN SOURCE COMPONENTS AND LICENSES

Some of the components included in Cisco CMX App for Splunk are licensed under free or open source licenses. We wish to thank the contributors to those projects.
jQuery version 2.1.0 http://jquery.com/ (LICENSE https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)

D3 JS version 3.3.5 https://github.com/d3/d3/releases (LICENSE appserver/static/components/d3/LICENSE)

Support

Email support will be provided as best effort.
CMX Connectors are supported by the CMX Cloud team at Cisco.
Cases can be opened by sending an email to cmx-cloud-support@external.cisco.com
Support requires a valid CMX installation and a CMX Advanced Licenses on applicable Access Points.
Cases can be opened 24x7

TEST YOUR INSTALL
The main app dashboard can take some time to populate the dashboards Once data collection is started. A good test to see that you are receiving all of the data we expect is to run this search after several minutes:
search `cmx_index` | stats count by sourcetype

In particular, you should see these sourcetypes:
 cmxhttp
 cmxanalytics
 cmxactive
 cmxmap
If you don't see these sourcetypes, check out logs under $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/CMX/ folder.",Version 1.3.4,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/83d1ab52-34c1-11e7-9ed7-02f13bdc2585.png,"IT Operations, DevOps",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,428,0,splunk,5,1,Crest Data Systems,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/neha10,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

Introduction
The RADAR Alert Action Add-on allows Splunk to create incidents in RADAR.
Requirements
To use the RADAR Alert Action Add-on, you will need a RADAR API token with Incidents Write scope.  You can create a token as a top-level RADAR administrator, or ask your local administrator to provide one for you.
Installation and configuration
To install the RADAR Alert Action Add-on, follow the instructions in the Splunk Add-ons documentation. Once the add-on is installed, perform the following steps:

Sign in to Splunk, click Settings in the top bar, then click Alert Actions. 
Click Setup RADAR Alert Action Add-on in the RADAR Alert Action row.
Create a RADAR API token. If you already have a RADAR API token with Incidents Write scope, skip to the next step.
In a separate tab or browser window, sign in to RADAR, go to the My Account page under the user menu in the upper right, then click the API Tokens tab.
Click Add Token, enter a name, then select the Incidents Write check box under Scopes.
Click Submit. Do not navigate away from this generated token page until you complete the next step; otherwise you will need to generate a new token.


Copy the entire token text, and paste it into the RADAR API token field in the RADAR Alert Action configuration screen. 
Click Save. If the update is successful, you should see a Splunk success message.

Usage
Create an existing alert with the RADAR alert action

In the Search & Reporting app, run a search for your string.
Confirm that the search results look as you expect.
Click the Save As dropdown link above the right side of the search box, then select Alert from the menu that appears.
Enter a title for your alert, along with a description if desired, and configure the standard alert fields related to permissions, scheduling, and trigger conditions according to your needs.
Under Trigger Actions, click + Add Actions, then select RADAR Alert Action.
Enter the incident name and description that you want RADAR to use when the alert is triggered, then click Save.  Your alert will be created, and Splunk will create an incident in RADAR any time it triggers.

Add a RADAR action to an existing alert

In the Search & Reporting app, navigate to the Alerts tab and locate the existing alert.
Click Edit, then select Edit Actions.
Click + Add Actions, then select RADAR Alert Action Add-on.
Enter the incident name and description that you want RADAR to use when the alert is triggered, then click Save. Spunk will now create an incident in RADAR any time the alert triggers.

Advanced usage
Default incident name and description
If you want a different default name or description for an incident, you can change this system-wide setting by manually editing a configuration file and restarting Splunk. 
The default values are defined in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/radar_alert_action/default/alert_actions.conf, but your changes go into the local configuration file that overrides these defaults: $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/radar_alert_action/local/alert_actions.conf. 
If this file does not already exist, create it with contents such as the following:
[radar]

param.radar_incident_name = New default name for created incidents
param.radar_incident_description = New default description for created incidents
Important: Overriding default configuration values will affect any existing alerts that used the previous defaults.
SSL certificate verification
The RADAR Alert Action Add-on uses HTTPS to securely communicate with Splunk and RADAR. Typically, a Splunk instance should be configured with an SSL certificate chain signed by a trusted certificate authority. When configured in this manner, HTTPS requests should succeed without additional configuration or intervention.
If you need to run Splunk and the RADAR Alert Action Add-on on a host without a trusted certificate authority chain, you have two options. Both of these are less secure than the recommended default and should only be implemented if you understand the security implications. The options are described in the following sections, although we strongly recommend taking the time to configure your system securely.
See the Splunk documentation about SSL for more on this topic.
Disabling SSL certificate verification
If you experience SSL certificate verification errors, the most straightforward option is to disable certificate verification. Only use this option if absolutely necessary, as disabling verification will remove a layer of security that is important for secure communications.
To disable certificate verification entirely, set the environment variable RADAR_SPLUNK_SKIP_SSL_VERIFY to any value (such as 1) when starting or restarting Splunk. For example:
RADAR_SPLUNK_SKIP_SSL_VERIFY=1 $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk start
or
RADAR_SPLUNK_SKIP_SSL_VERIFY=1 $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk restart
Once this is done, internal HTTPS requests between the RADAR Alert Action Add-on and Splunk will proceed without certificate verification. This should resolve any SSL-related errors that arise when configuring or using the add-on.
Adding the default Splunk certificates to your system's keychain
Splunk provides a set of default certificates that can be used out of the box. The certificates are self-signed, meaning they are not signed by a trusted certificate authority. Although not as secure as trusted certificates, using the default certificates is an option that can be made to work if for some reason you cannot set up a properly secured certificate and do not want to disable verification entirely.
The process of adding certificates will depend on your system and can be troublesome to get right. Here are some tips that may be useful:

The default Splunk certificates can be found at $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/auth/cacert.pem
Depending on your system, you may need to provide an environment variable to Splunk when starting or restarting to tell Splunk where the certificates can be found. For example, REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/auth/cacert.pem splunk start
If you continue to experience errors in the browser, check $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log for more information. Of course, you can always contact us with any questions and we will do our best to help.

Troubleshooting
Server error when attempting to configure RADAR Alert Action
If you see an error page that displays a 500 Internal Server Error when attempting to access the configuration page for the RADAR Alert Action Add-on, one possible cause is SSL certificate verification failure. You can check
$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunkd.log for diagnostic output to help determine if this is the case. If so, please see the above sections under SSL Certificate Verification for instructions.
If you continue to see 500 errors or other kinds of failure messages in splunkd.log, or are unable to resolve the problem with the instructions in this document, please contact RADAR.
Server error when saving the add-on configuration
When you click Save on the add-on configuration page, the system connects to RADAR to verify the provided API token. If you receive an error, please double-check that your token was set up with the Incidents Write check box selected and that it has been copied and pasted correctly.
Incidents not appearing in RADAR
If expected incidents do not appear in RADAR, check the following to narrow down the problem.
Every attempt to create an incident will be mentioned in $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunkd.log. Check this file to confirm that incident creation is being attempted, keeping an eye out for any errors that may have been logged in case of failure.
It can also be helpful to monitor triggered alerts to confirm whether triggers are happening when expected. You can set this up in Splunk by adding an alert to a list of triggered alerts.
When you add an alert to a list of triggered alerts, you can see records of recently triggered alerts from the Triggered Alerts page or from an Alert Details page.  Any alerts that would have created incidents in RADAR will display here. 
If you continue to experience issues, please contact RADAR and we will be happy to help.

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/335,2022-01-10,08:15:39 AM,split,,"June 30, 2010","There are a few occasions when log messages can end up lumped together. Sometimes it's because the log format has changed, sometimes the configuration was made badly, and sometimes things just go wonky.
To help deal with this a little, I've created this command for you lovely people to use called split. Using this command, you specify a regular expression that describes the beginning of a new event. For example, the log format for app foo changed yesterday, so we ended up with a bunch of entries in splunk that were blobbed together.
sourcetype=""foo"" | split start=""^\d+-""
In this case, the pattern says ""one or more numbers, followed by a dash, at the beginning of a line"". This matches ""2010-"" at the beginning of the log messages in question.
You can then further filter the events, if you only want some of them:
sourcetype=""bar"" error | split start=""^\d+-"" | search error
Caveats...
All of the field values from the previous message are copied along. This includes the date, so the date will be whatever was at the beginning of the chunk. If you need a field in the split log message, then they will need to be reparsed using kv, rex or eval.

Within the app there is a pipeline on top of the Machine Learning Toolkit that allows users to follow some simple click-and-select steps to load their ticket data and select some important features in the data. The app then decides how it should be processed by an ML algorithm â including automatically deciding how the data should be pre-processed in preparation for an algorithm.
Ultimately the app provides non-expert users identify frequently occuring types of tickets

This app requires a specific search query that generates a table or chart with at least 3 specific columns (ObjectID, X_Percentage, Y_Percentage) in order to properly show the visualization. The X and Y percentages are relative to the background image and should be calculated prior to using the app. It is recommended to store these coordinates in a lookup file since they should not change after being calculated.

With the SolarWinds add-on for Splunk, you have the ability to ingest the following SolarWinds data sources:
1-      SolarWinds alerts
2-      SolarWinds asset Inventory (network devices and their various attributes)
3-      SolarWinds queries which is a generic data input that allows you to index the output of any SolarWinds select statement/query
Installation
Deploy the spl file as a splunk app from Splunk Web using ""Install App from File"".
Configuration

Using Splunk web go to âSolarWinds Add-on for Splunkâ App 
Click on âConfigurationâ tab
Enter the Credentials under the âAccountâ tab. These are the credentials needed to authenticate to the SolarWinds API. The username/password used should have the minimum permission needed to run the SolarWinds query via REST API
Enter the Solarwinds Server and port under âAdd-on Settingsâ
Configure proxy if you have proxy between  Splunk and SolarWinds

Starting Data collection

Click on âInputâ Tab from within the âSolarWinds Add-on for Splunkâ App 
Add new Input. You have 3 types:
SolarWinds Alerts: This is an incremental poll that keeps track of last alert indexed in checkpoint file and queries the deltas for just the new alerts on next poll iteration. To configure, select the account used for authentication. Set the initial start time. Format allowed should follow ""yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss.%3f"" for example â2017-01-16 10:15:01.54â. 
SolarWinds Node Inventory (network devices and their various attributes): This is snapshot poll. This input allows you to take a snapshot of all assets at every poll. We recommend keeping the poll interval high 12h (43200 seconds) or higher
SolarWinds Query: This is a generic data input that allows you to index the output of any SolarWinds select statement/query. You can enter any SolarWinds select statement and index the output in splunk.

Overview
The Avalon Add-On for Splunk enables the interchange of data between Avalon and Splunk to support security investigations leveraging both platforms. The add-on provides custom search commands that allow for both the creation and update of Avalon workspaces from a Splunk search, as well as the retrieval of node and workspace data on demand. All add-on activity, to include details about workspaces and nodes, are visible in the Avalon Summary dashboard. Retrieved data can be filtered and configured for inclusion in a Splunk ES instance as a custom threat feed for further alerting. 
For more information or to request a demo, please visit www.kingandunion.com/splunk.
Installation & Configuration
The Avalon Add-On for Splunk can be installed directly from Splunkbase within your Splunk instance (Apps > Find more apps) or by uploading the file downloaded outside of Splunk (Apps > Manage Apps > Install app from file).
IMPORTANT In distributed Splunk architectures, the add-on must be installed at the search head tier. The search commands that interact with Avalon run on the search head only. Some commands will result in data being indexed to the avalon index. To allow for indexing to occur in a distributed environment, create the avalon index on your indexer(s). 
Once installed, login to your Splunk instance and perform the following configurations: 
Step 1 - Add API Key:

On the Avalon App installed Splunk instance, navigate to Apps > Avalon Add-on.
Inside the Add-on, Navigate to the Configuration tab > add-on settings:
Enter your Avalon Accountâs API key from your Avalon User Profile avalilable here
Enter the Avalan URL you use to login to avalonand click save - this most commonly is: https://avalon.kingandunion.com. (Leave the URL as default If unsure) 

Step 2 - Create Avalon Index:


Navigate to Settings from the menu bar and click on indexes. 


In the indexes Page, click New Index and create a new index with the name avalon. Leave all other settings as their defaults and click save. 


Step 3 - Create Add Avalon Nodes Input:

Navigate back to the Avalon Add-on from Apps > Avalon Add-on
Inside the Add-on navigate to the Inputs tab in the Add-on and click on the Create New Input button.
Give the input a name - any name will do.
Enter a refresh interval, 3600 is recommended.
Select index as avalon, created in Step 2 above. If you wish, you can use a different index, but be sure to slease select the Use a different Index checkbox.
With these settings click on the Add button. The input should be added without any errors. 

Step 4 - Verify Functionality:

Navigate to Avalon Summary tab.
Scroll down to the All Workspaces table and wait for loading to finish. 
Verify that you see workspace ID and Title from each workspace your user can see in Avalon.
By clicking on a workspace Title in this table, you can open the Avalon workspace in a new browser tab.
By clicking on an ID in this table, you will be able to index nodes data for each workspace from Avalon. Try clicking on few IDs to pull nodes from those workspaces.
Once the data is pulled, the nodes data and Workspace details should be visible throughout the dashboard. 

ES Integration
The Avalon Add-on for Splunk is capable of pulling nodes with tags from Avalon. If your Splunk Instance hosts the Enterprise Security app, you can now automatically send node data from Avalon into ES as a Threat Feed for better detection. Since investigations in Avalon may contain data that is not alwasy malicious but merely provides context to the investigaiton, tagging must be used by the analyst in order to take advantage of this automation. It is recommended that an organization develop a specific tagging shcema for IOCs that they wish to pull into Splunk ES as follows:
Step 1 - Creating Tags In Avalon:

Inside Avalon, while an analyst is performing an investigation, select 1 or more nodes > double click a node > click on tags
In the box, type in a tag like IsThreat and click create ""IsThreat"" to add the tag to the nodes. 

Step 2 - Configuring the Threat Feed for Splunk ES:

Back in the Avalon Add-on for Splunk, pull the nodes from the workpace in Step 1
Once these nodes are pulled into the Avalon Add-on by clicking on the workspace ID in the All Workspaces table, or by using the |pullnodes id=<workspace ID> command in the Splunk search bar. 
Click on the ES Integration tab. This will open the ES Integration Dashboard.
Choose the tags that will need to be added to the ES Threat Feed. 
Once selected, verify the nodes are showing up in the ES Integration Dashboard. Once added here, the nodes will be forwarded as Threat Artifacts into ES app. This process is scheduled to run every hour. 

Operation
The Avalon Add-On for Splunk provides the following custom search commands for interacting with Avalon inside of Splunk Enterprise: 

avalon: Create or update workspaces with data from a Splunk search. 
pullworkspaces: Retrieve workspace data from Avalon. 
pullnodes: Retrieve node data from Avalon. 

Creating a Workspace
Create a search in Splunk that results in the values you would like to send to Avalon in a table format. Once the results are to your liking, pipe to the avalon create_workspace command.
Consider the following example:
index=apache clientip=10.10.5.* | dedup clientip | table clientip | avalon create_workspace=âhttpdâ
This search would result in all 10.10.5.* client IP addresses being added to a new workspace named httpd. The new workspace will be immediately available in Avalon. 
When data is sent to Avalon, an event is written to the avalon index. To review the indexed data, run the following search over the desired time range:
index=avalon sourcetype=avalon_push
Updating a Workspace
Create a search in Splunk that results in the values you would like to send to Avalon in a table format. Once the results are to your liking, pipe to the avalon update_workspace command. 
Consider the following example:
index=apache clientip=10.10.7.* domain=*.gov | dedup clientip domain | table clientip domain | avalon update_workspace=âhttpdâ
This search would result in all 10.10.7.* client IP addresses and .gov domain values being added to the httpd workspace previously created. Based on the prior example, the httpd workspace would now contain nodes reflecting the 10.10.7.* and the 10.10.5.* client IP addresses, as well as the .gov domains. 
When data is sent to Avalon, an event is written to the avalon index. To review the indexed data run the following search over the desired time range:
index=avalon sourcetype=avalon_push
Retrieving Node Data
Run the pullnodes command by itself with either a workspace ID or title to retrieve node and workspace metadata. 
| pullnodes id=123 would retrieve node data and workspace meta from the workspace with an ID of 123.
| pullnodes title=âhttpdâ would retrieve node data and workspace meta from the httpd workspace.
The search command will show the data that was returned in the Splunk interface. It also writes an event to the avalon index. To review the indexed data run the following search over the desired time range:
index=avalon sourcetype=avalon_nodes
Retrieving Workspace Data
Run the pullworkspaces command to retrieve a list of available workspaces and metadata. 
| pullworkspaces
Beyond providing the means to quickly view what workspaces are available, the command is also called hourly via saved search to populate a lookup containing the workspace ID and workspace title. 
Reporting
The Avalon Summary dashboard provides visibility and insight into the add-onâs operation. The dashboard panels are as follows and are scoped by workspace, node type, and time range unless otherwise indicated: 

Total Nodes: The distinct count of nodes retrieved by the pullnodes command and indexed in Splunk.
Overlapping Nodes: The number of nodes that exist in more than one workspace. 
Total Pulls: The number of times the pullnodes command was run. 
Total Pushes: The number of times the avalon create_workspace and avalon update_workspace commands were run. 
Last Pull: The most recent timestamp of the last pullnodes execution. 
Last Push: The most recent timestamp of the last avalon create_workspace or avalon update_workspace execution.
Nodes by Workspace over Time: The count of nodes by workspace. 
All Workspaces: The list of all available workspaces, workspace meta, and node count. The list is pulled from indexed events and also the workspaces lookup table.
Clicking on a value in the Last Pull or ID columns will open a new window and run the pullnodes search command for the particular workspace.
Clicking on the Title or Node Count values will open the workspace in Avalon.
Count by Node Type: A chart showing a breakdown of nodes by node type and workspace. 
Activity over Time: A chart showing all âpushâ and âpullâ activity between Splunk and Avalon. 
Nodes: A list of nodes with node type and the workspace(s) the node is found in. The list may be further refined by entering a value in the Node Search field.
Clicking on a table row will drill down to search for the node in your indexed data.
Clicking the Node Search link will search for all nodes in your indexed data. 
Clicking the Update Lookup link will write the results in the Nodes table to the avalon_nodes lookup. 

The avalon_nodes lookup can be used with your other searches, reports, and alerts to add context or otherwise enrich data in Splunk. For example, an alert could be created that sends an email or performs another action when a particular node value appears in your indexed data.",Version 1.0.1,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/2427846c-4915-11eb-b708-0281150c11dc.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,151,0,splunk,5,2,King and Union,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/king_and_union,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

Highlights

Real-time dashboards, panels, and search fields to easily view and investigate Blue Coat data
Contains latest performance and scalability improvements
Correlate Blue Coat data with other data sources in Splunk Enterprise to detect and remediate additional advanced threats

Dependencies
The app requires the Google Maps (http://splunk-base.splunk.com/apps/22365/google-maps) app from Splunkbase.  You do not need to install this apps if you do not wish to use the mapping features. However, the main dashboard will not render properly without the above apps.
Installing
If you want to use the map feature, install the app dependencies from Splunkbase.  If you are running a distributed splunk setup, the app contains an Add-on that you can install on the indexers.  Otherwise, you just need to install the app from splunk base.
Getting data in
In Splunk, you will need to add a new TCP Data input.  The app expects the source type to be bcoat_log.  You may choose something different, but you will need to modify the app as well. Too add this input, log into Splunk and click on Manager.  Under the Data section, click on ""Data inputs"".  Then click on ""Add new"" for a TCP input.  On this page, you can enter the port number, 20108 for example.  You can optionally override the source name as well.  Leave ""Set sourcetype"" as ""From list"", and choose bcoat_log from the dropdown list.  Click on more settings, and set the index for this source to be bcoat_logs.
In Blue Coat, you will have to set up custom client for the logs you want to forward to Splunk.  You will need to give it the Splunk indexer IP address and the TCP port you specified earlier.
If you are using a different index, in addition to modifying the bcoat_request macro, you will need to modify the bcoat_overview dashboard.  To do this:

From the Splunk for Bluecoat app, click on Manager on the top right portion of the screen
Click User Interface
Click Views
Click bcoat_overview
In the text-editor, search for index=bcoat_index and replace it with the correct index
Click Save
Navigate back to the app, and the splash page should now work.

Configuring the app
You may have to modify the incoming sourcetype, transforms.conf, and props.conf depending on your BlueCoat configuration.  By default, the app expects the incoming logs to be in the bcreportermain_v1 format for ProxySG 6.2.x and above.  Specifically, it expects these fields: 
date, time, time_taken, c_ip, cs_username, cs_auth_group,
x_exception_id, filter_result, category,http_referrer,
sc_status, action, cs_method, http_content_type, cs_uri_scheme,
cs_host, cs_uri_port, cs_uri_path, cs_uri_query,
cs_uri_extension, http_user_agent, s_ip, sc_bytes, cs_bytes,
x_virus_id, x_bluecoat_application_name, x_bluecoat_application_operation

If you are running an earlier version of SGOS, you can create an entry in the bcoat_proxysg section of your local props.conf file to use the brceportermain_v1_old format. It's the same format but without x_bluecoat_application_name and x_bluecoat_application_operation.
If you use a different log format than those, you will need to create an entry for it in your local transforms.conf file.  Then in the bcoat_proxysg section of your local props.conf, you will need to set REPORT-main to the name you specified in the transforms.conf.  You may need to set appropriate field aliases as well.
Modifying the macros
The app uses macros to define the categories for WFA issues and possible infections.  Depending on your policies, you may want to modify these macros to suite your needs.  These are located in the macros.conf file.",Version 3.0.7,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/6df6a6ce-6900-11e3-b4de-005056ad5c72.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAAFA,"12,276",0,splunk,2,11,Will Hayes,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/will,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

This is a notice to inform you that support for Splunk Cloud Gateway will end on October 11, 2021.
Weâre upgrading and improving the Splunk Mobile and Connected Experiences experience by replacing Splunk Cloud Gateway with a revamped and streamlined application called Splunk Secure Gateway. 
Upgrading to Splunk Secure Gateway
If you haven't done so already, we strongly recommend that you migrate from Splunk Cloud Gateway to the Splunk Secure Gateway app before the End of Support on October 11, 2021.
Splunk Enterprise 8.1 or higher and Splunk Cloud 8.1.2103 and higher already include Splunk Secure Gateway. Enable Splunk Secure Gateway and use the migration feature in the app to migrate your devices.
Upgrading to Splunk Cloud Gateway v1.13.3
If your Splunk deployment is running versions below these Splunk platform versions, update your Splunk Cloud Gateway app to version 1.13.3 before October 11, 2021 to continue using the app without interruption. After October 11, 2021, all versions of Splunk Cloud Gateway below 1.13.3 will no longer function.

About PAVO Endpoint App for Splunk
Overview
Most sourcetypes contain endpoint events of some sort. This app provides Splunk dashboards, forms, and reports which can be used to explore your endpoint events across your different sourcetypes.
To do this, the app relies on the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) for endpoint events. This means that the app can report on any endpoint data, as long as it has been on-boarded properly, and is available through the Endpoint data model.
A note on Splunk Data Model Acceleration and Disk Space
This app requires data model acceleration, which will use additional disk space. If you are using the Splunk App for Enterprise Security, this is already enabled, and should have been factored into your retention policies. If not, you should review the documentation on data model acceleration, how it uses disk space, and how to plan for it.
A note on the Splunk Common Information Model
As mentioned above, the app uses the CIM for endpoint events. The CIM allows you to take events from a number of sources or products, and report on them in one cohesive manner, using a common set of names for fields and event types.
Available Dashboards
Endpoint Overview
Provides a starting point for exploring your endpoint events. Most panels will drill-down to other pages in the application.

Prerequisites
Because this App runs on Splunk Enterprise, all of the Splunk Enterprise system requirements apply.
This app depends on data models included in the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on, specifically the Endpoint data model. Please review the information on installing and using the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on and information on configuring the acceleration on the data model.
The Splunk Common Information Model Add-on can be downloaded from Splunkbase.
This app has been tested with versions 4.12 of the CIM add-on.
In order to make the app respond and load quickly, accelerated data models are used to provide summary data. For this data to be available, the Endpoint data model must be accelerated. Information on how to enable acceleration for the Endpoint data model can be found here. The data model must be accelerated for the length of time for which you would like to see reporting.
Lookups
PAVO Endpoint App for Splunk does not contain default lookup files.
Macros
There are macros that are used to standardize pulling events from the Endpoint data model. There are also macros that rename fields to make standard fields.

Upgrade the App
If there is already older version of app installed in your Splunk instance, then you can upgrade app by following two ways:


Using the latest version available on Splunkbase.

From the Splunk Web home screen, click the gear icon next to Apps. 
There will be option to update the App to the latest version in column name as - ""Version"".
Click on ""Update to [version]""
Follow the installation steps to update the App.



You can download latest version of App from Splunkbase and you can upload it into Splunk by navigating to 

From the Splunk Web home screen, click the gear icon next to Apps. 
Click on, Install app from file -> Choose File 
Choose the location of App's build downloaded and make sure you have checked checkbox of ""Upgrade app.""
And then click on Upload
Restart the Splunk



Configuration
Admin will have to update/replace name of the index in 'get_sg_index' macro if StorageGRID data is being indexed in any index other than main. There is no additional configuration required.  
Update index in macro

On Splunk web go to Settings > Advanced search > Search macros.
Select NetApp StorageGRID App for Splunk in App. Change Visible in the App to Created in the App.
Search for macro name get_sg_index and click on it to edit.
Change definition of macro with the new index or indexes configured.
Ex. (index=storagegrid)
Click on Save.

Lookups

sg_account_mapping - This is CSV file based lookup which consists details of tenant accounts having their names and ids.
sg_hierarchy - This is CSV file based lookup which consists details about hierarchy of configured storageGrid.
sg_storagenode_mapping - This is CSV file based lookup which consists details of all storage nodes.

Saved Searches
This app contains the following saved searches, which are used for populating data in the dashboard:

SG-accountMappingLookup - Used to populate - ""sg_account_mapping"" lookup and is triggered at an interval of 15 minutes.
SG-hierarchyLookup - Used to populate - ""sg_hierarchy"" lookup and is triggered at an interval of 15 minutes.
SG-storagenodeMappingLookup - Used to populate - ""sg_storagenode_mapping"" lookup and is triggered at an interval of 15 minutes.

Troubleshooting
Test Your Install
The main app dashboard can take some time to populate the dashboards Once data collection is started by Add-on. A good test to see that you are receiving all of the expected data is to run below given search on Main app search dashboard after several minutes:
search `get_sg_index` | stats count by sourcetype

In particular, you should see these sourcetypes:

grid:rest:api
grid:auditlog

If you don't see these sourcetypes

Verify the macro configurations in the App. Refer to ""Configuration > Update index in macro"" section for more details.
Please check troubleshooting guide for the NetApp StorageGRID Add-on for Splunk.

If the dashboard filters are not being populated

Make sure all the saved-searches in the App is enabled.
Try restarting Splunk search head. In standalone restart Splunk.

| croniter input=cron_schedule start_epoch=timestamp_field end_epoch=timestamp_field
Note that if both ""iterations"" and ""end_epoch"" are specified, the end_epoch will take precedence.
Sample Search
Starting now, show the next 25 expected runs for scheduled searches using a cron schedule and combine them to show which times have the highest number of searches scheduled.
| rest /servicesNS/-/-/saved/searches splunk_server=local
| where disabled=0 and is_scheduled=1
| table cron_schedule,title,disabled,is_scheduled
| croniter iterations=25 input=cron_schedule
| stats values(title) as searches,dc(title) as dc_searches by croniter_return
| convert ctime(croniter_return) timeformat=""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S""
| sort 0 - dc_searches
Same as the previous except start the iterations at a timestamp 2 days previous:
| rest /servicesNS/-/-/saved/searches splunk_server=local
| where disabled=0 and is_scheduled=1
| table cron_schedule,title,disabled,is_scheduled
| eval start_epoch=relative_time(now(),""-2d@d"")
| croniter iterations=5 input=cron_schedule start_epoch=start_epoch
| stats values(title) as searches,dc(title) as dc_searches by croniter_return
| convert ctime(croniter_return) timeformat=""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S""
| sort 0 - dc_searches
Search using an end epoch instead of iteration count as the marker for stopping the generation:
| rest /servicesNS/-/-/saved/searches splunk_server=local
| where disabled=0 and is_scheduled=1
| table cron_schedule,title,disabled,is_scheduled
| eval myendepoch=relative_time(now(),""+3d@d"")
| croniter end_epoch=myendepoch input=cron_schedule

Overview
The JDS AppDynamics Ingester Technology Add-on (TA) for was created to support use with Splunk Cloud as well as Splunk Enterprise and to provide the following features:

Stores data in the Splunk Metric Store (as opposed to an Event Index),
Certified for Splunk Cloud, with support for installation within the Splunk Inputs Data Manager (IDM) environment, removing the need for data to traverse the clientsâ network when running Splunk in the cloud and using the AppDynamics SaaS platform.
Significantly lowers the administration effort in configuring metrics to be ingested by providing easily configurable filters and toggling for applications and metric types.
Easy configuration of in-scope applications, with the ability to configure an index per app if required.
Easy configuration of in-scope metric types for all controllers/applications or specific controllers/applications.
Support for all metric types including Application Monitoring (APM), End User Monitoring (EUM), Databases, Servers & Analytics
Support for multiple controllers, with configuration of HEC endpoint and metric indexes per controller.
Supports the Google SRE Golden Signals concept to reduce the administrative effort in metric selection.

Availability and Licensing
The add-on is currently only available from JDS Australia and is not generally available to Splunk users publicly. Contact JDS for more information.
Addon Overview
The AppDynamics Ingestor TA is designed to take advantage of the Splunk Metric Store which is optimised for ingestion and retrieval of metrics. This provides for greater storage efficiency, significantly faster query times and allows you to take advantage of the Metrics Workspace. The Splunk Metrics Workspace provides a user interface that enables you to monitor and analyze metrics and other time series data without using SPL.
The TA provides a simple configuration page to configure applications and metric types without needing to understand the AppDynamics API or provide low level configuration. 
The AppDynamics TA supports the following AppDynamics Metric types:


Metrics gathered from AppDynamics Application agents, such as:

Overall App / Tier / Node performance metrics
Business Transaction metrics
Service Endpoints metrics
Information Points metrics
Remote Service metrics
Database metrics (application-side)



Infrastructure Visibility (Server/Database) metrics

OS-level metrics such as CPU, Memory, Disk I/O, Network I/O
Database Monitoring KPI metrics (database-side)
Container metrics



End-User Experience metrics

Browser metrics
Mobile metrics
Synthetics monitoring metrics



Business iQ

Analytics Custom Metrics



The JDS AppDynamics Ingestor TA can be deployed on a Splunk Heavy Forwarder for Splunk Enterprise users or Inputs Data Manager (IDM) for Splunk Cloud.
Only key Service Level Indicators (SLI) or Golden Signals are ingested into Splunk by this add-on to allow blending with other data sources for summary dashboards or to include KPIs or leading indicators in health calculations in Splunk IT Service Intelligence (ITSI). It is not intended to replicate all AppDynamics data into Splunk. Detailed troubleshooting, analysis and dashboarding should continue to be performed in AppDynamics. 
External data sources & inputs
The TA retrieves data from your AppDynamics Controller via the metric APIs. This may be an AppDynamics SaaS Controller or on-premise Controller.
There are 3 modular inputs that do this job on a schedule: 
* AppDynamics Application List * Periodically retrieves the list of applications available on enabled AppDynamics Controllers and stores their metadata in the Splunk KV store. 


AppDynamics Metric List: Periodically retrieves metric metadata for each enabled application, targeting metrics specified in the metric filter config. 


AppDynamics Metric Ingest: Periodically retrieves metric data for each metric that matches the enabled metric filters, pulling 1 minute data for the time period since the previous retrieval (up to max 2 hours)


Requirements
Splunk requirements


This TA has been tested with Splunk Enterprise v8.1 and 8.2. It may work on 8.0 but is untested. 


Requires Python 3.7 (part of Splunk 8.x)


Requires the Splunk KV Store to be enabled on the Heavy Forwarder, Splunk Cloud Inputs Data Manager (IDM) or Search Head that it is installed on, with REST API enabled


Requires one or more metric indexes to be available.


Requires a HTTP Event Collector (HEC) to be provisioned, and access from the TA to that HEC address/port open. If a default metric index isn't set for the HEC, then the desired index must be set in the TA configuration page. 


Requires an Event Index to be available for internal diagnostic events (e.g. ingest rates, errors etc)


The TA must have network connectivity to your AppDynamics API(s) address/port. If you have ACLs or firewalls between your Splunk installation and your AppDynamics installation, these must be opened. Forward proxies are not currently supported.


Administrator privileges are required for a user to configure the TA on the instance (eg HF/IDM) the TA is deployed to. 


AppDynamics Requirements


Requires a user account or API Client account (preferred) to be created in AppDynamics, with read privileges for all applications and data types that are to be ingested. A user account must be local or LDAP. SAML accounts are not usable with AppDynamics APIs.


Has been tested with AppDynamics Controllers 21.x. Should work with Controllers 4.5.10 and above, but 4.5.x and 20.x are untested and some data types may not work as expected. 


Currently does not explicitly support privately signed SSL certificates. You will need to ensure your AppDynamics API URL uses a publicly signed SSL certificate, or you will need to manually add the certificate to be trusted by Splunk (not possible for Splunk Cloud).


Configuration

JDS will include detailed configuration information and support as part of a license/purchase agreement for this add-on and can help with installation and setup.
There are 4 main configuration screens
Inputs: configure the app list, metric list and metric ingest jobs. 
Controller Config: enter and maintain AppDynamics controller and HEC details including credentials. Credentials are stored using the Splunk Password storage API which encrypts secrets at rest.
Application Config: list the applications from the enabled controllers and allows them to be enabled/disabled for ingestion. 
Metric Filter Config: create and maintain filter configs for each desired metric type to be ingested, with options to limit the filter to specific controllers/apps.



Third party libraries
The following open source libraries are used in this TA in addition to libraries packaged with Splunk: 
 https://pypi.org/project/six/
 https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/1.4/ (includes a tar.gz package of timezone information)

For built-in data inputs, alert actions, and commands, create API Keys with the correct permissions in the Carbon Black EDR and then configure Splunk to use those keys.
Data Onboarding
To properly onboard the VMware CB EDR data, please follow the documentation. Once the data is configured via HEC, AWS S3, or file with UF, refer to this documentation to continue configuration.
Configuring Event Forwarder & S3 Inputs
Requirements and recommendations
The AWS add-on for Splunk is required for configuring S3 inputs. The add-on can be downloaded from Splunkbase. This add-on will be used to configure inputs for this Splunk app. Before configuring any inputs, you should create separate queues and S3 buckets for alert and endpoint events. A Carbon Black Event Forwarder must also be configured in order to forward data to the S3 buckets and to efficiently take in data, see the Event Forwarder Configuration section below.
Event Forwarder Configuration
An event forwarder must be created before any input can be received. This forwarder will be responsible for routing data to an S3 bucket where it can then be taken as input by Splunk. Configure your forwarder with filters to limit the amount of event data forwarded to Splunk in order to reduce costs. The forwarder installation guide for VMware CB EDR is located at Developer Network. It is recommended to follow the guide there, and then proceed with the installation and configuration of Splunk.
More details can be found at the CB Event Forwarder on Github.
User Guide
Initial Application Configuration
VMware Carbon Black EDR is configured from the Application Configuration menu option under the Administration menu.


VMware Base Configuration


The options configured on this page will update settings in local/eventtypes.conf.


VMware CB EDR Base Index: specify where the events from EDR will be searched. Required on the searching tier.


VMware CB EDR Action Index: specify where events generated from alert actions will be stored and/or searched. Required on the searching tier. Should be a single index. index=main




API Token Configuration

Use this tab to configure access to VMware Carbon Black EDR. The application supports multiple API Configurations to enable data from multiple Carbon Black EDR organizations to be ingested.



Alert Actions


All available alert actions will be displayed on this page.


See the Alert Actions section below for configuration details and considerations




Custom Commands

See the Custom Commands section below for configuration details and usage examples
NOTE: Do not modify any configurations in ``/default``. Doing so will cause your changes to be overwritten when the app is upgraded. If required or directed to by support, create the appropriate configuration files in ``/local`` and include the stanza attributes that are being changed.



Alert Actions


Alert Configuration Notes: The global configurations referenced below are configured under Administration/Application Configuration under the Alert Actions tab.


ALL search results that are being passed to the alert actions are required to have a host field that corresponds to the correct Organization Name as configured in the API Configuration Tab.


If you use multi-tenancy, include the host field with the corresponding value in the Splunk search query. This value is the Organization Name found in the API Token Configuration.


By default when a new alert is created in Splunk the parameter action.*.param.api_config = \<api_config guid> will be added to the savedsearches.conf file in the VMware Carbon Black EDR local directory. If you need to change credentials used on an alert action in the Application Configuration dashboard then all previously created alerts that were using the old credential needs to be changed. After updating credentials, delete the above parameter from the savedsearches.conf file for the appropriate saved search and restart Splunk.

Splunk App for Amazon Connect helps you analyze your contact center data from Amazon Connect. The app uses the connect data that is generated by several data sources such as Contact Records, Agent events from Kinesis streams, Reports and Transcripts from S3, connect application logs, contact flow logs and metrics via cloud watch to help gain insight on the current state and understand how customer service is being impacted at your contact center.

Support
This application can be installed on both On-Prem and Cloud deployments of Splunk.
Requirements

Splunk Add-on for AWS (for various inputs)
Timeline Viz (custom visualization)
Event Timeline Viz (custom visualization)

Installation
Install the application on Forwarders and Search Heads
Configuration

Connect Events [sourcetype=aws:connect:firehose]
Connect generates two type of events - Contact Trace Records (CTR) and Agent Events. Once data streaming for Connect is enabled, it generates CTRs after a contact session ends and these events are sent to Kinesis Streams.
There are two eventtypes for Agent events - HEART_BEAT and STATE_CHANGE events. The HEART_BEAT eventtype is periodically generated and STATE_CHANGE events are generated at specific times when the Agent/Contact has an internal state change. These events also use the same method of transport as CTRs. Splunk uses both of these event types to determine Agent Status and decode contact information. Be sure to use the aws:connect:firehose sourcetype for these data sources.
These events are then sent to Splunk via a Kinesis Firehose using Splunk Kinesis Data Firehose (KDF) integration. A HTTP Event collector input needs to be setup on Splunk and a Firehose delivery stream then has to be setup to relay messages from streams to Splunk.
NOTE:
Follow guidelines to create a firehose stream to Splunk: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/creating-the-stream-to-splunk.html
Connect S3 Reports [sourcetype=aws:connect:s3:reports]
Connect admin can generate scheduled reports and send them to a S3 bucket. These reports contain historic queue and agent metrics and can be scheduled in the Connect instance via the historical metrics tab.
The Amazon Connect app for Splunk uses the Queue Contact metrics and Agent Performance metrics. These reports (CSV) are pulled from S3 using the SQS-based S3 input provided in the Splunk AWS TA. Be sure to use the aws:connect:s3:reports sourcetype for this data source.
NOTE:
Splunk expects the above reports' file names to have the specific prefixes - historic_agent_performance_all_metrics-.csv and historic_queue_contact_all_metrics-.csv
Under Table Settings, select all metrics for Queue Contact and Agent Performance.
Modify respective source's csv header names in transforms.conf accordingly if you wish to not select all metrics for the Queue Contact or Agent Performance.
Connect API metrics [sourcetype=aws:connect:firehose]
Connect API metrics, both historic and realtime queue metric data are retrieved from the application's API endpoints. A lambda function is used to query Connect's REST endpoints every 60 seconds and the records are then coalesced with queue information and sent to the above configured Kinesis Streams. The API data is streamed into KDF from Kinesis Streams for Splunk to read using HEC input. Use the aws:connect:firehose sourcetype for this data source. (See in Artifacts for the Lambda function and configuration details)
Contact Lens Analysis Reports [sourcetype=aws:contactlens:s3]
Contact Lens Analysis Reports [sourcetype=aws:contactlens:s3]
Connect admin can generate voice analysis reports for every voice call using the Contact Lens service. When enabled, the service analyzes the voice call after the call is complete and publishes a report to a S3 bucket. Splunk pulls these JSON reports from S3 using the SQS-based-S3 input provided in the Splunk AWS TA. Splunk uses this data to provide bidirectional sentiment analysis for each contact. Use the aws:contactlens:s3 sourcetype for this data source.
Connect Instance Metrics [sourcetype=aws:connect:cloudwatch:metrics]
Connect Instance Metrics [sourcetype=aws:connect:cloudwatch:metrics]
Connect generates instance and application specific metrics. These metrics are sent to Cloudwatch. Splunk pulls these metrics using the Splunk AWS TA. Use the aws:connect:cloudwatch:metrics sourceytpe for this data source.
NOTE: The connect metric namespace has to be setup in the TA before the metric data can be pulled. See below in the Artifacts section for examples
Contact Flow Logs [sourcetype=aws:connect:cloudwatchlogs]
Contact Flow Logs [sourcetype=aws:connect:cloudwatchlogs]
Connect admin can generate contact flow logs for each contact flow. When contact flow logging is enabled in Connect, the logs are sent to Cloudwatch logs. Splunk can pull those logs from the specific cloud watch log groups using Splunk AWS TA. Use the aws:connect:cloudwatchlogs sourcetype for this data source.
NOTE: Permissions for Lambda functions used by contact flows need to be added to Connect configuration to invoke those functions. (Splunk can pull those lambda function logs from the respective cloud watch log groups using Splunk AWS TA. Use the aws:cloudwatchlogs sourcetype for this data source).
Artifacts
Use the publicly available serverless application (splunk-amazon-connect-api-metrics-processor) to query Connect API metrics and send the data to a kinesis data stream.

USER GUIDE
Key concepts for SA-geodistance

<base_search> | geodistance latfield=<field> longfield=<field> output_field=<field>
                miles=<bool> group_by=<group> haversine=<bool>

This app can return distances as miles or kilometer (default).  To return distances in miles,
pass the miles=True as an argument to the command.
It computes the vincenty distances by default. To use haversine instead, add the paramter haversine=True or haversine=T
It can also compute the adjacent distances for different groups by passing the grouping criteria, group_by=group.
This currently supports grouping by a single field. A future update will support grouping by multiple fields.


Note: The first event in the result will also have a distance of 0.0


Events that do not have latitudes or longitudes, as is the output when geocoding private non-routed IP addresses,
     will be given a distance of 0.0. The next relative distance will still be based on last public address found.


Example 1
This can be used to easily obtain the distance between multiple VPN authentication attempts
which could indicate a compromise where relative distances are above a maximum/expected commutable distance.
index=vpn | stats count by src_ip , user |
iplocation src_ip |
fields src_ip, user, lat, lon  |
geodistance latfield=lat longfield=lon output_field=distance group_by=user
Example 2
This example has been written around the sample app that comes with Splunk.
THis example was carried out using the data generated by the sample app that ships disabled with Splunk Enterprise.
This search extracts the clientip field from the relay field,
and geocodes using the inbuilt iplocation search command.
The relative distance in (Km) of each adjacent event is then computed using the geodistance command.
S1:

Add-on Homepage: https://apps.splunk.com/apps/id/TA-aws_waf
Author: Hurricane Labs
Description
The purpose of this add-on is to provide value to your AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) logs. This is done by making the logs CIM compliant, adding tagging for Enterprise Security data models, and other knowledge objects to make searching and visualizing this data easy. This add-on also provides a concise guide for how to get your AWS WAF logs into Splunk using AWS Kinesis Firehose (see README for more details).
+Built for Splunk Enterprise 6.x.x and higher
+CIM Compliant (CIM 4.0.0 or higher)
+Ready for Enterprise Security
+Built around JSON format from AWS Kinesis Firehose
++https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/Firehose/ConfigureFirehose
++https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging.html
Useful Information

This add-on assumes you are using the sourcetype ""aws:waf"". If you need to use another sourcetype, copy default/props.conf into local/props.conf and change the sourcetype stanza. You could also use a source based stanza if needed.
This add-on requires the data be in the JSON format from Kinesis Firehose. This was only tested using AWS Kinesis Firehose sending to Splunk using HEC (best practice).
Theoretically you could have WAF stream to Firehose and have Firehose write to an S3 bucket or SQS in JSON format and use the AWS Add-on to pull from there. As long as you have it in the exact same  format, there's no reason this add-on wouldn't work. I'd still recommend using HEC over S3/SQS because it's more efficient and scales better. I have not tested this.
--a. https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876/
If you want to save on license at the cost of operational awareness, you can trim out default allowed WAF events
--a. https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/trimming-aws-waf-logs-with-amazon-kinesis-firehose-transformations/
If you want to map ruleGroupId to a human readable rule name, you can use a lookup table (utilizing an automatic lookup) to do so. This would go on your Search Head(s):

$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-aws_waf/lookups/aws_waf_rule_lookup.csv
rule,ruleGroupList{}.ruleGroupId
rule01_sql_injection_rule_id,16d7c32b-d853-478c-9540-5538167d202b
rule02_auth_token_rule_id,96730828-e43c-4613-98f0-1fee90d092b2
$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-aws_waf/local/transforms.conf
[aws_waf_rule_lookup]
batch_index_query = 0
case_sensitive_match = 1
filename = aws_waf_rule_lookup.csv
$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-aws_waf/local/props.conf
LOOKUP-aws_waf_rule_lookup = aws_waf_rule_lookup ""vendor_rule"" OUTPUTNEW rule
INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
Search Head: Add-on Always Required (Knowledge Objects)
Heavy Forwarder: Add-on Possibly Required (Data Collection and Event Parsing)
Indexer: Add-on Possibly Required (Data Collection and Event Parsing)
SH & Indexer Clustering: Supported
Add-on Installation Instructions

Install this add-on on the Splunk Enterprise instance that has the HEC inputs/token.
--a. Restart Splunk to ensure the add-on settings (line breaking and timestamp) are in place before proceeding.
Install this add-on on your Search Heads where the knowledge objects are required.
--a. A Splunk restart will not be required. If the knowledge objects do not appear, run a debug/refresh.
--b. To increase tagging efficiency, copy default/eventtypes.conf to local/eventtypes.conf and add ""index=XYZ"" where XYZ is the index you're using.
Proceed to follow ""Data Ingestion Instructions""

Data Ingestion Instructions

Setup a HEC input and token to be used in AWS. Set the index to whatever you prefer, and set the sourcetype to ""aws:waf"". Make sure to enable indexer acknowledgement as well. All of this will be in inputs.conf (see example inputs.conf below).
[http://aws_waf]
disabled = 0
index = aws
indexes = aws
sourcetype = aws:waf
useACK = true
token = <HEC_TOKEN_HERE>
--a. Where the token goes is going to vary greatly depending on your environment. Here are some use cases ranked in order of preference:
----1. Best Practice: Use an Indexer Cluster & a third party Load Balancer (this is NOT a Splunk component/feature). Load Balancer should listen on TCP/443 and distribute requests to TCP/8088 on the indexers. HEC token and input should be distributed from your Cluster Master to the indexer peers.
------a. https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/Firehose/ConfigureanELB
----2. Single Indexer: If you have a standalone indexer (not clustered), have your indexer listen on TCP/8088. Setup the HEC inputs and token locally, or use your Deployment Server.
----3. Heavy Forwarder: A Heavy Forwarder is required if you can't setup an external load balancer in front of your indexer cluster. Have your Heavy Forwarder listen on TCP/8088. Setup the HEC inputs and token locally, or use your Deployment Server.
Configure WAF to stream to Kinesis Firehose: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging.html
--a. Keep in mind your end goal is to keep these events separated logically and in JSON format containing all the fields listed from above. If you do something that deviates, you may need to adjust some regex in local/props.conf.
Configure Kinesis Firehose to send data into Splunk over HEC (HTTPS): https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/Firehose/ConfigureFirehose
--a. If you're using an external load balancer, your endpoint will be the load balancer. Otherwise, it will be the Splunk instance you're sending directly to.
--b. You should choose ""raw"" as the endpoint type.
--c. This is the step where your HEC token will be used.
--d. You do NOT need this add-on installed. It's only linked here for the helpful documentation.
Verify data is coming in and you are seeing the proper field extractions by searching the data:
--a. Example Search: index=* sourcetype=aws:waf

Supported
Required
Comments




Search Heads
Yes
Yes
This add-on contains search-time knowledge. It is recommended to turn visibility off on your search heads to prevent data duplication errors that can result from running inputs on your search heads instead of (or in addition to) on your data collection node.


Heavy Forwarders
Yes
No (but recommended)
It is recommended to install this add-on on a heavy forwarder for data collection.  Data collection should be configured in only 1 place to avoid duplicates.


Indexers
Yes
No
Not required as the parsing operations occur on the forwarders.


Universal Forwarders
No
No
Universal forwarders are not supported for data collection because the modular inputs require Python and the Splunk REST handler.



Configuration
Ensure the prerequisites are met above.

Access Splunk Web on the node of your Splunk platform installation that collects data for this add-on.
Launch the add-on, then click the Configuration menu item > Account > Add
Enter the username and password to use for the add-on.  Refer to the minimum permissions needed for the account above.
Select the Inputs menu item > Create New Input
Give the input a name.
Enter an interval (how often this input collects data).
Select an index.
Select an input mode.
Continuously Monitor will poll for new data based on the interval
Index Once requires a start date and end date and will only index the data in the given date range.


Select the account.
Specify the Query window size (minutes).  When Continuously Monitor is selected, each time this input runs a start date is calculated for the Office 365 API query.  The end date for the Office 365 API query will be the calculated start date plus the number of minutes specified by this parameter.  For example, if the calculated start date is 2018-01-01T00:00:00 (midnight on January 1, 2018), the end date for the query will be 2018-01-01T00:01:00 (one hour after midnight) if the query window size is 60 minutes.
Specify the Delay throttle (minutes).  Microsoft may delay trace events up to 24 hours and events are not guaranteed  to be sequential during this delay ( reference ).  This parameter specifies how close to ""now"" the end date for a query may be (where ""now"" is the time that the input runs).  Continuing from the example above, if ""now"" is 2018-01-01T00:02:00 (two minutes after midnight) and the delay throttle is 60 minutes, the input will exit because the end date for the query is only 1 minute away from ""now"". Each time the input runs, the input will exit and do nothing until the end date is at least 60 minutes away from ""now"".
Select a Start date/time to specify how far back to go when initially collecting data.  This parameter is optional when Continuously Monitor is selected, but the parameter is required when Index Once is selected.
Specify an End date/time if Index Once is selected.

The ssdeep project (http://ssdeep.sourceforge.net) allows to create fuzzy hashes, which turn to be useful for malware analysis. Unlike sha, md5 etc. it is not creating a whole new string when a single element has changed. It is a quick and neat way to compare two files etc.
This addon is here to provide lookups from your Splunk data, as well as your local files to create fuzzy hashes, and compare them.
Examples
Hashing the content of the field ""foobar"":
* | `ssdeep_hash_buf(foobar)`
Hashing the content of the file ""/tmp/foo"" on your filesystem:
* | eval filename=""/tmp/foo"" | `ssdeep_hash_filename(filename)`
Comparing two hashes:
eval sig1=""384:v7JMIgq+DZfCgnMeCTs6Jcb2H295Ku30pXOp9YXaLNZcp7FpFdVRTIYlNzHVhv1l:fgqgqxeC3H295Ku30pXI9YXaLfcQLA"" | eval sig2=""384:v7JMIgq+DZfCgnMeCTs6Jcb2H295Ku30pXOp9YXaLNZcp7FpFdVRTIYlNzHVhv1l:fgqgqxeC3H295Ku30pXI9YXaLfcQLA"" | `ssdeep_compare(sig1, sig2)`

Deployment
Single Server Deployment:
In a single server deployment, single instance of Splunk Enterprise functions as data collection node, indexer and search head. In such deployment, install the add-ons Proofpoint Email Security Add-On and Proofpoint TAP SIEM Modular Input. After that, install Proofpoint Email Security App For Splunk.
Distributed Deployment
In a distributed deployment, typically a combination of forwarders are deployed for data collection, separate indexer nodes for data ingestion and search heads for data visualization are deployed. We recommend installing our Add-Ons on both Forwarder and Search heads and the App on the search head.

Proofpoint On Demand Email Security App Configuration
Changing the Index
By default this app uses the ""main"" index to look for Proofpoint logs. To change this to an index that the Proofpoint On Demand Email Security Add-on uses, you need to edit the pps_get_index macro. Here are the steps:

Navigate to Settings->Advanced Search and select ""Search macros""
Change the app context to ""Proofpoint On Demand Email Security App""
Select the macro named ""pps_get_index""
Change index=main to the correct index. Please make sure this index matches the one used by the Proofpoint On Demand Email Security Add-on.
Save the configuration.

Accelerate the Data Model
By default, the data model acceleration is not enabled. You need to enable this to make sure the dashboards show the realtime data.

Login to Splunk as admin and select Settings then Data Model.
Make sure to select ""Proofpoint On Demand Email Security App"" app context.
On ""Proofpoint On Demand Email Security Data Model"", click the ""Edit"" and select ""Edit Acceleration""
Select the ""Accelerate"" checkbox.
For ""Summary Range"" select week, month, year or all time depending on how much data you would like to see on the dashboard.
Save the configuration

Verification
Note: Please wait few minutes after the changing the Acceleration settings to check the dashboard.

Currently, there seems to be no easy way to report on and dump out all all your alerts without clicking the mouse 1000+ times - especially if you have say 800+ alerts defined and running.Wouldn't it be nice to have the ability to dump outall of the Splunk alerts you defined to a .csv file and review all your alerts with Excel?Now you can.This app provides a way for an organization or an individual to convert user defined alertscontained in internal splunk savedsearches.conf files to a user friendly readout provided by a .csv file.When you save searches and create alerts - Splunk stores them for you in a number of savedsearches.conf files.You may have alerts defined in only one savedsearches.conf file or in many savedsearches.conf files depending on if different users are defining their own alerts.The work flow to dump out the alerts is fairly easy:First install this app.Then select the app.Once the app is selected:The app has a search bar.Enter a search of "" |  exportalerts list"" (without the "")  to get a list of where your savedsearches.conf files are stored.For a list of relative paths to your savedsearch.conf files enter ""| exportalerts list"". Then run the search again with ""| exportalerts PATH "".  Where the PATH is a path you have cut and pasted from the ""| exportalerts list"" search The "" | exportalerts list"" command or search will give you a list of one or more paths to the savedsearch.conf files relative to this app.Highlight and cut or copy each line and paste it into the "" | exportalerts "" command as a suffix.For example:| exportalerts ../../search/local/savedsearches.confWould be a correct search string to cause the app to list your alerts defined in this particular savedsearches.conf fileAnd once you get a list of your alerts then:Lastly save this search with all your alerts listed below as a REPORT. Then run the report and export as a csv file.To export a report as a .csv file - look in the far upper right of the app screen for a downward pointing arrowinto a horizontal bar. This is the export / download to .CSV icon which you want to use from a REPORT.You can only download to a .csv file when you SAVE your search as a report.For example: You located a savedsearhes.conf file and you issued ""| exportalerts ../../username/savedsearches.conf"" file and you see alerts below. Next - open the report. You will see the alerts listed below in the report.Go to the upper right menu bar of the report. Look for export and export to .csv. The symbol / icon is a downward arrow into a horizontal line.You can name the .csv file and it starts to download from your browser.Once the .csv file is downloaded to your desktop use Excel.For more detailed help on how to use this app:Select this app in the drop down.

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/936,2022-01-10,08:18:03 AM,haversine,,"March 20, 2015","Haversine calculates the distance between two points represented via latitude and longitude using the haversine formula. It augments each event with the calculated distance, storing the result in a field named 'distance' or another field optionally specified by the user.
While the distance between two points is a relatively basic piece of data, this tool provides a piece of information absent from many tools that provide location awareness (a common example might be an IP geo-location utility).
Knowledge of distance between two points can enhance understanding of user behavior and demographics, origin of security events, illustrate patterns of movement and velocity, and identify anomalies related to specific locations.
---
General usage information:
Latitude and longitude for input must be represented in decimal degree format (e.g. ""-44.11,78.23""), though separate input fields may be specified for each. The default unit of distance is the kilometer, but output in miles may be optionally requested by the user. The point of origin relative to which distance is calculated can be specified as a static value or dynamically from data provided in each event.
---
Syntax:
haversine outputField=fieldname units=mi|km (origin=""latitude,longitude"" | originField=fieldname) (inputFieldName | inputFieldLat=fieldname inputFieldLon=fieldname | inputLatitudeFieldName inputLongitudeFieldName)
---
Example Use
Calculate the distance of a lat/lon pair stored in field 'latlon' relative to a static point of origin, storing result in a custom field named 'dist'
... | haversine origin=""-39.44,88.12"" outputField=dist latlon
... | haversine origin=""-39.44,88.12"" outputField=dist lat lon
Specify input field names for latitude, longitude, and origin; the relevant field values are extracted from each event. Stores the calculated distance (using miles as a unit of measure) in an output field named 'dist'.
... | haversine originField=my_location units=mi inputFieldLat=lat inputFieldLon=lon outputField=dist
Calculate the distance of a lat/lon pair stored in field 'latlon' relative to an origin, storing result in the default output field 'distance'

Choose FortiGateActions and select the field to block if an event matches the search.



After logs matching the search has been detected, there will be a firewall policy
added in the FortiGate which trigged the event. The policy will include a
comment ""fgt_ar"" for users to easily identify.



Troubleshooting:
If the policy is not created on FortiGate after running active response action:


Make sure the add-on has been set up with FortiGate's information including correct device id, admin password, IP address and the IP address enables https access.

If you are using this app in an on-prem Splunk Enterprise deployment, you may be able to continue using this app, but Splunk will not provide support in case of issues and we strongly recommend discontinuing use. If you are currently using this app in a Splunk Cloud deployment, it will be phased out in the near future. We strongly recommend upgrading to Splunk Add-on for Windows 6.0.0 or later, which has incorporated the functionality of this add-on as well as Splunk Add-on for Windows DNS.https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/tips-and-tricks/end-of-availability-splunk-built-apps-and-add-ons.htmlThe Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Active Directory provides the necessary Active Directory knowledge objects for a Splunk App for Microsoft Exchange or Splunk App for Windows Infrastructure deployment. The add-on helps you better understand and get the most out of your Windows Server Active Directory or Microsoft Exchange environment. Download the add-on to integrate into your Splunk App for Microsoft Exchange or Windows Infrastructure deployment or use it to provide Active Directory data to your own Splunk app.The Splunk Add-on for Windows Active Directory version 1.0.0 is not supported when installed alongside the Splunk Add-on for Windows version 6.0.0. The Splunk Add-on for Windows version 6.0.0 includes both the Splunk Add-on for Windows DNS and the Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Active Directory.",Version 1.0.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/1f8ac810-3cb8-11e6-8c55-06caea5ac9f9.png,"IT Operations, Utilities",http://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-software-license-agreement.html,"34,006",0,splunk,4,4,Splunk Works,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/splunklabs,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

This Splunk application is specifically designed to work with the Ansible Splunk Callback maintained by Deloitte. This Splunk application provides guided navigation for the monitoring and diagnostics of Ansible plays.

Getting Started Overview
Below is an overview of how to get this Splunk application and the Ansible Splunk Callback working:

Install this Ansible Monitoring & Diagnostics using the normal Splunk process
In Splunk add a HTTP Event Collector data input with a sourcetype of _json. Ensure to enable tokens and disable SSL
Place the splunk.py Ansible callback file, currently in the apps bin directory, into a directory within the root of your Ansible playbook called callback_plugins
Update your ""ansible.cfg"" with settings from the Splunk HTTP Event Collector data input as below

callback_whitelist = splunk
[callback_splunk]
url = http://mysplunkinstance.example.com:8088/services/collector/event
authtoken = f23b1ad6-5965-4537-bf69-b1aa54B1aa88
Now when you run your ansible plays, detailed JSON formatted results will now be sent to Splunk.
Support Ansible Versions
Ansible => 2.5
Known Issues
With Ansible 2.4 the following errors occur:
callback set_options() got an unexpected keyword argument 'task_keys'
Please avoid using Ansible versions below 2.5
Ignoring Invalid SSL Certificates:
We are aware that there is currently no way to ignore invalid SSL certificates when using HTTPS on the Splunk HTTP Event Collector. Valid SSL certificates work fine and here is a link to using Lets Encrypt to get valid certificates. A whilst this outlines the process for Splunk Web the same process slightly modified works fine for the HTTP Event Collector.

Deloitte & Splunk DataPaaS
Deloitte are a global Splunk specialist partner and we developed this application for internal use for our DevOps teams who use and develop Ansible extensively. Our Splunk specialists deploy all customer Splunk deployments using our Data Platform as a Service tool kit which is Ansible based and provides a CI/CD solution for deploying and managing Splunk at large scale.

index=_internal (host=idx* OR host=sh*) source=""*metrics.log"" instance_guid=* component=Metrics group=instance earliest=-6h
| stats latest(instance_guid) AS guid by server_name
| rename server_name AS splunk_server | outputlookup meta_woot_server_guid
This will be updated in a future release.
New Changes in Version 4.0

Added descriptions for each dashboard to aid in understanding
Meta Woot! no longer consumes Splunk license
Filters added to allow for index exlusion from Meta Woot! Latency and Indexing Compliance dashboards 
New functionality added to report on estimated license usage 

Upgrades from Version 2 to Version 4
If you are upgrading from version 2 to version 4 you must run the search named ""Migrate Meta Woot Key"" one time following the upgrade. This search will modify the key used for the KV store and remediate an issue where keys could potentially be duplicated. Important: You do not need to run this if you are already on version 3 or higher.
- If you do not run this search, then any existing records will not be updated going forward until you do. 
- You only need to run this search one time, then you can disable it.
Overview
The app leverages a tstats search to populate/update a KV store based lookup on a periodic basis with accurate metadata, specific to host, sourcetype and index. In addition, each time the lookup is updated, the rows being updated are written to a summary, which will allow for event count trending, latency and license usage over time by host, sourcetype and index.
Why is this useful?
You can use the data generated by Meta Woot! to:
- Instantly correlate hosts with sourcetype and index
- Quickly identify data sources that are logging behind / ahead of time.
- Identify hosts that might be sending one sourcetype but not another
- Create metrics to measure whether data sources have stopped coming in
- Accurately measure event count volumes by splunk server, index, sourcetype and host
- Calculate license volumes by index, sourcetype, host and even individual events!
- See all the hosts associated with each sourcetype and all the sourcetypes associated with each index
- Estimate license costs associated with your data sources and hosts
Why not just use tstats or the metadata command?

The metadata command is not guaranteed to be accurate at scale
The metadata command is silo'd - meaning you cannot correlate host, sourcetype and index together
The tstats command takes time to run over longer time frames - especially when focused on index time

How do I install this?
The app is simple to install.
1. Download the app from Splunkbase
2. Install the app on a search head or search head cluster.
3. Go to the search manager page and enable the ""Generate Meta Woot Server GUID Lookup"" search and RUN THE SEARCH to initially generate the lookup. (NOTE: See known issue at top - this must be edited for Splunk Cloud)
4. Go to the Data Models page and enable the acceleration for the Meta Woot License Usage data model. Default acceleration range is 7 days, but feel free to select a longer period.
5. Go to the search manager page and enable ONE of the ""Generate Meta Woot Every X Min"" searches. All searches are disabled by default. The 15 min search is typically a good one to use.
6. (optional) If you wish to have the summary data write into a different index, go the macro page and edit the meta_woot_summary macro.
7. (optional) If you wish to filter out certain indexes, sourcetypes, splunk_servers or hosts, go to the macro page and edit the meta_woot_index_filter, meta_woot_sourcetype_filter, meta_woot_splunk_server_filter and/or meta_woot_host_filter macros.
8. (optional) If you wish to have the summary data read from a different index, go to the macro page and edit the meta_woot_read_summary macro. Defaults to use the meta_woot_summary macro.
9. (optional) If you wish for Meta Woot! to clean out records that have not been updated for X seconds, enable the ""Remove Meta Woot Stale Data"" search. You can define X in seconds by editing the meta_woot_stale_data_secs macro. The default time is 2592000 secs, which is 30 days.
10. (optional) If you wish to enable accurate license cost reporting, go the macro page and edit the meta_woot_license_cost_per_gb and update with the approximate cost you are paying per Gb.
11. Restart the Splunk SH after installing.
That's it - the search will run and the KV store will populate after the search has run for the first time.
How Does It work?
The app is focused on 'Index Time' data. Essentially every time the search runs, it looks back over a certain index time period. One search runs every 15 mins and looks back over a 15 minute index time range (20m@m to -5m@m). Another search runs every 5 mins and looks back over a 5 minute index time range (-10m@m to -5m@m). There is also now a 30 mins search as well. To take into account some processing delays in index time, we leave a 5 minute buffer. In addition to this rolling time window the search has outer time parameters of -4d and +24h. This is to account for latent data or data logging with future timestamps. This sounds inefficient, but the search runs pretty fast and the index time criteria helps focus the search down.
We chose to focus on index time, as we can then have a rolling window with some degree of accuracy. For example, if a host sends data into Splunk right now, but the data is 4 hours late; the index time would be the time it hits Splunk (i.e. now), so we would catch it. The only time we would not pick up the data is if data comes in that has an event timestamp more than four (4) days behind or in the future. If this case applies to your data, then you can adjust the time range accordingly - although you should really fix your data sources!
Each time the search is run, the events for that specific Index time window are gathered. The data, together with event counts is then summarized using the collect command to a summary index. The search then continues and updates the KV store with the latest data. Existing records are updated and any new records are added.
What Does the Meta Woot KV Lookup contain?
Meta Woot generates a KV state table of every host, sourcetype, index combination that has been seen in Splunk. It is continually updated every time the search runs. The following fields are in the lookup:
host - the hostname
sourcetype - the sourcetype
index - the index
hash - an md5 hash of host.sourcetype.index
recentTime - the index time
lastTime - the last timestamp for that data set
firstTime - the first timestamp for that data set that Meta Woot! has seen
lastUpdated - the last time the row in the KV store was updated
What does the summary index contain?
The summary index contains snapshots of the data found each time the search runs. For example, if you choose to run the 15 minute search, then there will be a summary dump each 15 mins of the data identified within that 15 minute index time windows. In addition, we capture event counts for each host, sourcetype, index combination. The event counts allow you to trend data counts over time. You would simply do something like | timechart span=15m sum(count) as count by host  etc.
The summary index that is used can be set by amending the meta_woot_summary macro.
The sourcetype for the summary data is meta_woot.
host - the hostname
sourcetype - the sourcetype
index - the index
recentTime - the index time
lastTime - the last timestamp for that data set
firstTime - the first timestamp for that data set that Meta Woot! has seen
count - the event count
_time - the time that the dump was created
Using the default summary index, you can search for this data using index=summary sourcetype=meta_woot
What does the Meta Woot License Usage Data Model do?
The Meta Woot License Usage Data Model maps and accelerates the internal license data in Splunk. This data is then correlated with event volumes to calculate license volumes per event and host. The volume by host in the license internal data by itself is typically not accurate in large environments, so integrating this data and correlating with event volumes allows us to fairly accurately calculate license volumes by host and even by individual event. Pretty cool! In order for this to work, Meta Woot! must be installed on a Search Head that has visibility into the license logs. Typically we would encourage installing Meta Woot! on the same host as your DMC environment.
Are there dashboards/reports?
Yes, there are seven dashboards
- Meta Woot! Search - leverages the KV store data to report on the hosts, sourcetypes and indexes
- Meta Woot! Trends - leverages the summary data to show event count trends over time
- Meta Woot! Latency Compliance - leverages the summary and KV store data to report on data latency
- Meta Woot! Indexing Compliance - leverages the summary and KV store to report on data sources that have stopped sending data
- Meta Woot! First Time Report - Reports on data sources that have been seen for the first time over a selected past timeframe
- Meta Woot! License Volume Usage - leverages the license usage data model to show license usage by sourcetype, index and over time
- Meta Woot! License Event Usages - uses the KV store, license usage data model and summary data to show license usage per host and event
Important Stuff
Requirements:
- Only works on Splunk 6.3 and above
- You must have a 64 bit version of Splunk installed
- In large environments, ensure that you have hardware that meets Splunk's requirements - the KV store can get big if you have a lot of hosts, sourcetypes and indexes.
- For the license model and reporting to work, Meta Woot! must be installed on a Search Head that is able to search the internal license data
Other Points:
- In some large environments the 30 min search may be more efficient than the search that runs every 5 mins. The selection of the right search will depend on how real-time you need the data to be and how long the search takes to run.
- Default search now looks back over 4 days, instead of 10 days, for better scalability in large environments
- It is recommended that Meta Woot! be installed on the same SH that you run the Splunk Monitoring Console (DMC)
How to Set Default Compliance Thresholds
The default thresholds for both the Meta Woot! Latency Compliance and the Meta Woot! Indexing Compliance can be changed. Simply edit the default values for the text box inputs. These values will automatically be passed down to the rest of the panels within the dashboard.
For Meta Woot! Latency Compliance edit: âMedium Latency (mins)â and âHigh Latency (mins)â
For Meta Woot! Indexing Compliance edit: âDelayed Thresholds (mins)â and âLate Threshold (mins)â
How to Change Cell Value Colors
If the colors used for cell highlighting need to be changed, the hex values can be edited in the CSS file for the appropriate class. The CSS file is located:
$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/meta_woot/appserver/static/metawoot_cell_highlighting.css

Installation

Install whatever Splidget app you want. Currently there are three. Feedback, SearchFu!, and or Splunkpad. You will see an icon at the bottom right that will persist and provide you a way to access your Splidget from any of the other Splidget apps you have installed by default. E.g. As you install other Splidgets, their icons will show up in the group as well.  If you would like the same icons in any of your other apps simply drop the dashboard.js file from the Splidget appserver/static directory of any Splidget app into the desired apps appserver/static directory. You will need to bounce the Splunk server to register the new dashboard.js file.  The icons WILL NOT SHOW UP ON THE SEARCH DASHBOARD PROVIDED BY SPLUNK. This page is locked down. Bummer, but that is the way it is.

What is GuardDuty?
Amazon GuardDuty, announced at re:invent 2017, is a continuous security monitoring service that requires no customer-managed hardware or software. GuardDuty analyzes and processes Amazon VPC Flow Logs and Amazon CloudTrail event logs. GuardDuty uses security logic and AWS usage statistics techniques to identify unexpected and potentially unauthorized and malicious activity. This can include issues like escalations of privileges, uses of exposed credentials, or communication with malicious IPs, URLs, or domains.
GuardDuty informs you of the status of your AWS infrastructure and applications by producing security findings that you can view in the GuardDuty console or through Amazon CloudWatch
events.
GDI
A short video that walks through pushing CloudWatch Events generated by GuardDuty to Splunk is available here. Note that these events are delivered to Splunk over HTTP Event Collector
Usage
The ""TA"" is purely for storing KOs to make the specific dashboards work - it does not handle data collection. Since these are CloudWatch Events, both the AWS Lambda Blueprints and SQS-based Mod-Input in Splunk_TA_aws are sufficient.
Both simplexml dashboards (guard_duty.xml and guard_duty2.xml) are examples that can be integrated into the existing splunk_app_aws or extended for your own use.",Version 1.0.4,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/def4fc4e-3922-11e8-b08a-02f13bdc2585.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-software-license-agreement.html,"4,961",0,splunk,0,0,Splunk Works,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/splunklabs,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

AssetDB is a Splunk application that allows merging distinct data sources into an asset data base, without the need for Splunk Enterprise Security. The app is currently in beta and may be prone to bugs. 
Support
This app is currently unsupported for Internet Explorer
Usage
Navigate to the ""Configure"" tab to configure AssetDB
Asset Lookups
Create lookup files and corresponding lookup generation searches for each unqiue data source that provides asset information. 


Add lookup file: Click the Add Lookup button to add a lookup file to be used to populate the merged Asset Database. A demo lookup file, assetdb_demo_assets.csv is provided by default. 


Delete lookup file: Click the Delete link next to an existing lookup file in the Lookups Table to remove the lookup and prevent its contents from being merged into the Asset Database.


Asset Fields
Create fields to be stored within the Asset Database and merged between all input lookup files. 


Add field: Click the Add Field button to add a new field into the Asset Database. See the Field Properties section below for more information on field properties. Predefined fields are provided by default, but can be edited or deleted if needed. 


Edit field: Click the Edit Field button to edit an existing field into the Asset Database. See the Field Properties section below for more information on field properties. 


Delete field: Click the Delete Field button to delete an existing field from the Asset Database. Deleting a field, does not remove that field from any underlying lookup files. 


Field Properties
The following field properties can be set when adding a new field or editing an existing field. 



Property
Description




Field Name
The name of the field. Must consist of alphanumeric characters or underscores. Field names _key and asset are automatically created during the asset merge process and cannot be overwritten.


Key Field
Whether the field is a key field or not. Key fields are fields that define a unqiue asset and are used during the asset merge process. See How AssetDB Merges Assets for more information on.


Case Sensitive
Wether the field is case sensitive or not. A value of No will set all field values to lower case.


Ignore Values
(Optional) A comma seperated list of field values to ignore (e.g. null,none,unknown).


Fill Null
(Optional) A static value to fill null entries of a field with (e.g. a default asset priority).


Field Type
Defines the type of field. Use a single value, keep all unique entries as a multivalue, or use an eval expression to define this field.


Merge Method
(Only applicable when Field Type is Single) Defines how a single value is derived across the input lookup table files.- Latest: the most recent value- Min: minimum value, only applicable to numeric field values- Max: maximum value, only applicable to numeric field values- Avg: average value, only applicable to numeric field values- Coalesce: define a precedence by ranking the source data with the Coalesce property


Coalesce
(Only applicable when Merge Method is Coalesce) Defines the precedence of source data to be used for this field.


Max Values
(Only applicable when Field Type is Multivalue) The maximum values the multivalue field can have. Excess values are trimmed. Large mutlivalue fields can lead to reduced performance.


Eval Expression
(Only applicable when Field Type is Eval) An SPL eval expression to define the field.



How AssetDB Merges Assets
AssetDB uses Key Fields to merge assets together into a single Asset Database. A detailed example, with pictures, can be found at https://github.com/alatif113/assetdb
Asset Merge Search
Merging is done via a custom command adbmerge and saved search assetdb-lookupgen that runs on a user defined frequency. By default, this frequency is once a day. The saved search is automatically updated based on Lookup and Field configurations. Merged assets are outputted to the assetdb KV store.",Version 1.4.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/3c3c6420-214e-11ec-a49c-da63f6e04afc.png,Utilities,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alatif113/assetdb/main/LICENSE,68,0,splunk,0,0,Mohammed Latif,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/alatif113,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise
