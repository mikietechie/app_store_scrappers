If they differ, the suggested change is shown in the ""definition_data"" field. There could be a difference because some data is no longer present and the macro could/should ""shrink"" or because there is new data and the macro could/should ""expand"".  Use the ""URL"" field (cut & paste to browsser) to jump directly to edit any datamodel's index macro.This app also contains a set of macros to greatly increase the flexibility and accuracy of SIEM drilldowns (there is an example correlation search that demonstrates this).",Version 0.0.9,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/71e7d72e-5f8f-11ec-86d4-b2ae16c94785.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html,11,0,splunk,0,0,Gregg Woodcock,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/woodcock,"Products: Splunk Enterprise

Simple modular input written in Go which starts a webserver and listens for incomming requests. Data received in the request body or form params is the indexed by Splunk. This can be used to receive data from Webhooks.
Dependencies

Splunk 5+ (tested with 6.1)
Linux, MacOSX or Windows (Windows is untested but should work)

Usage
Install the app in Splunk Manager and go to Settings -> Data Inputs -> URL Receiver to add a new input.
Input Settings


port (int, required)
TCP Port to list for incoming HTTP requests.


path (string, required)
URL path to match against to associate an incoming request to a configured input. Requests not matching the path of any input will receive a HTTP 404 response and will not be indexed.


data_retrieval (string, default ""raw_body"")
""Define how data is extracted from incoming HTTP requests. Possible values are:
""raw_body"" - Index the raw body content of the HTTP request
""form_field"" - Index the content of a particular form field (see form_field)
""form_kv"" - Index generated key-value pairs for all POST- or GET params
""full_request"" - Dump full request details (including request line, headers and form data)


form_field (string, default """")
(For data_retrieval=form_field) Read and index the value of a form field of incoming HTTP requests. The form field can either be the value of a param of the decoded POST/PUT body (either url-encoded or multipart) or the value of the query string for a GET request.


host_from_clientip (boolean, default false)
If enabled use the IP address of the client sending the HTTP request as the host field of the indexed event.


debug (boolean, default false)
Enable debug logging for this input (logs to splunkd.log)


response (string, default ""OK"")
Text send back to the client after successfully receiving data.

Flagging an event simply sets the annotate field as 'flag'. 
---Important---
When performing an annotation, you MUST wait for the search job to finish. Or else, Annotate cannot access the search ID to find the event. 
How to annotate events

Perform a Splunk search using any application
In the search string, add: 
| eval annotate=""YOUR NOTE"" 
What is typed inside the quotes will be added as the annotation to the event
This will render the same search output, but allow us to add a custom field value


Open an event, and find the Event Actions 
Click ""*Annotate: "" to annotate a single event
Click ""*Annotate All: "" to annotate all events found in that search job



How to flag events

Perform a Splunk search using any application
Open an event, and find the Event Actions 
Click ""*Flag: "" to flag a single event
Click ""*Flag All: "" to flag all events found in that search job



View annotated events

All
Shows all the events that are annotated or flagged  


Annotations 
By default shows all annotated events
Allows you to search for annotated events
For multi-worded annotations, you can search subsets of the annotation


Flags
Shows all flagged events  


Search
Just normal Splunk searching



Removing annotations

Navigate to splunk/etc/apps/annotate/lookups
Open the file ticket_correlation.csv (text editor works just fine)
Find the event(s) you want to delete, and remove the row(s)

Customizations


You can remove/disable workflow actions from Settings->Fields->Workflow Actions. If you don't think you will ever need an action, just disable it.

Tango is a set of scripts and Splunk apps which help organizations and users quickly and easily deploy honeypots and then view the data and analysis of the attacker sessions. 
Requirements

You will need to add your own VirusTotal API key to the Splunk app, which can be configured at /opt/splunk/etc/apps/tango/bin/vt.py  The API is free to obtain, you will just need to follow the procedures found on their website to receive one. Please note that you are limited to 4 requests per minute, so if you attempt to do more than that, you will not receive any information. This pertains to the File Analysis section of the Splunk Honeypot Intelligence app.
In order for the VirusTotal custom command to work, you'll need to add the Python library ""requests"" source into the tango app's bin directory /opt/splunk/etc/apps/tango/bin/. Requests can be found here: Kenneth Reitz Github. 
To install requests, you can run git clone https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/ in /tmp, then move the folder called requests from inside that directory into `/opt/splunk/etc/apps/tango/bin'
If you want to add some visualizations to Tango, you will need to install the dendrogram splunk app, which can be found here. Once installed, you'll want to run the command below to move the contents over to Tango:

$ cp -r /opt/splunk/etc/apps/hobbes3_dendrogram/appserver/static/ /opt/splunk/etc/apps/tango/appserver/static

By default, this app displays the count and values of the nodes, which can be visually distracting. If you wish to remove these values from being displayed, edit the autodiscover.js file in /opt/splunk/etc/apps/tango/appserver/static/dendrogram/dendrogam.js and change lines 206 and 207 to:

var long_label = d.name
var short_label = d.name

Restart Splunk after you made the above changes.

Before You Begin
There are a few things that should be noted before you install:

The Tango Honeypot Intelligence Splunk App is built to use JSON formatted data from Kippo, this was made available in the fork maintained by Michel Oosterhof, which can be found on his github. He recently added this feature, so you will need to grab the latest copy for this app to work properly (if deploying the honeypot and Splunk separately.)
If you want to automatically deploy preconfigured honeypots alongside a Splunk Universal Forwarder, you can use the other tools included with Tango, which can be found at the Tango GitHub project page

Using the Tango Honeypot Intelligence Splunk App
Once you enter the app, you'll be first taken to the ""Attack Overview"" portion of the app, which shows a broad overview of the attacks against your sensors. This includes Attempts vs. Successes, Latest Logins, Attackers logging into multiple locations, etc.
You'll notice at the top of the app, in the navigation pane, there are multiple categories of reports available to you, which include:

Attack Analysis
File Analysis
Network Analysis
Sensor Management
Threat Feed

Below we will go through each section and describe some of the data available in each section.
Attack Analysis
Attack Overview
This dashboard shows a broad overview of the attacks against your sensors. This includes Attempts vs. Successes, Latest Logins, Attackers logging into multiple locations, etc.
Session Playlog
This is one of the most beneficial dashboards available in the app, since it actually shows you what the attacker is doing on your honeypot. At the top of the dashboard, you can see the most recent sessions along with a filter to select a particular sensor. Clicking on a session will populate the panels below, which includes the passwords attempted/accepted, the commands entered, any files downloaded during the session and the raw logs for the session.
Attacker Profile
Using this dashboard, you can inquire about a certain IP and if seen in the app, you can get valuable information pertaining to that IP to include:

Geolocational data
Times seen
SSH Client versions
Sessions seen
Files Downloaded
Malware Downloaded Visualization

Session Analysis
This series of dashboards contains some analytical information, to include the % of sessions with interaction, the various SSH versions seen, some environment details extracted by the session, and a Human vs. Bot Identification dashboard.
Location Overview
In this section, you are able to see various geographical data related to each session and attacker. There are currently three dashboards available:

Top countries from which attackers have logged in from
Top countries where attackers have scanned from
Top sensors that have been attacked

We also include a map which includes the location of attackers seen.
Username/Password Analysis
Currently, this dashboard contains the top usernames and passwords seen being attempted by the attackers, as well as the top username/password combinations.
Malware Analysis
File Analysis
Starting at the top of this page, you can see the latest files downloaded by attackers, which includes the following:

URL of file
SHA256 Hash of file
Sensor which the file was seen being download
The session identifier of the session, which the file was downloaded
The time that the file was downloaded

Below that is the latest ""Attempted"" file downloads. This contains URL's that were seen in a session that do not have a corresponding SHA256 hash (which indicates a successful download). This can be due to a server error on the hosting website, an incorrect spelling of the file, or if this URL was seen elsewhere in the command, perhaps as an argument or target site of the malware.
Lastly, is a panel which you are able to look up a particular SHA256 hash seen previously downloaded in VirusTotal to retrieve the following information:

Date Scanned
SHA256 Hash
How many AV vendors identified this file
The various signatures of the file

Please note that the VirusTotal API is limited to 4 requests per minute. With that being said, you can use this panel to quickly lookup the file hashes seen by in your sessions.
This ""lookup"" will produce a local ""cache"" to use in other dashboards, so it's useful to run lookups on any malware you see. This was created do to limitations in the Virustotal API, and will be used as a workaround for the time being.
Malware Analysis
This dashboard will show the Top 10 Malware Signatures we've seen over time, as well as the most recent legitimate malware. This dashboard is populated from the VirusTotal local ""cache"" found on the File Analysis page. This dashboard will also show you files that have been downloaded, but, produced no signatures in Virustotal.
Malware Campaigns
This set of reports give you information on possible campaigns associated with your sessions. Currently this includes:

Potential Malware Campaigns (By URL)
Potential Malware Campaigns (By Domain)
Potential Malware Campaigns (By Filename)
Potential Malware Campaigns (By SHA Hash)

This section will continue to be developed to include other possible campaign attribution by looking at other TTP's associated with each session. This could include commands entered during each session, terminal variables (size, language, SSH keys, etc.). For now, we can see the URL's, Domain's and Filenames that have been seen being used by multiple attackers.
Network Analysis
Network Analysis
This dashboard currently includes reports on the following:

Top Domains Seen
Same URI on Multiple Domains
Latest IP Addresses Seen

Network Visualization
This dashboard provides a graphical representation of the malware downloaded onto each sensor by each attacker, along with the URL and SHASUM of the malware.
Sensor Management
Add Sensor
This page contains the necessary commands to run on a system to install a honeypot using scripts from the Tango repository.
Edit Sensor
In this dashboard, you are able to edit a few fields for your sensors, these fields are:

Owner
Owner Email
Comment

Sensor Status
This dashboard provides geographical information pertaining to each sensor currently deployed. You will find the following information available to you in this dashboard:

Sensor Name
Last Active
Sensor IP Address (External IP)
ASN
ASN Country
Network Name
Network Range

This dashboard also provides you with a map populated with the locations of all your sensors deployed.
Threat Feed
Lastly, this dashboard contains feeds which you can download and integrate with other network monitoring solutions, which will hopefully be automated in the future.
The feeds currently available are:

IP Addresses
Potentially Malicious URLs
SHA File Hashes
Potentially Malicious Domains
File Names

To-Do

Utilize Data Models to speed up searches
Auto-extract indicators inside of malware
TOR Exit Node Identifier

Known Issues

The sensor management page will not update automatically, it is currently set to populate new sensors at midnight. I'm working to do this a better way.

Simply call | refresh in the search bar to reload the endpoints. Use | refresh entity=all to also reload the splunktcp cooked REST endpoint (can result in data loss!)
Or specify an entity to be reloaded | reload entity=foo
Installation

clusterstats is an external python search command packaged as an add-on for
Splunk.
I wrote clusterstats to give stats about clusters of anomalous (slow)
transactions. The search I was working with used transaction to tie related
events into a transaction and add the duration field. I then piped the results
into a command to filter out the normal transactions and leave the slow ones:
| search duration > 3
The command expects to be passed a maxspansecs=X argument and it expects to be
piped events which contain _time and duration fields, and it expects the results
to be in reverse order since it needs to process in time order to calculate the
start of a cluster, the end of a cluster, the number of transactions in the
cluster, the max and mean duration for the cluster. Keep in mind that the max is
probably accurate but the mean is only averaging the duration from the filtered events so it is the mean duration for the cluster of events > than 3 seconds if the above filtering search is used.
The command returns a new set of events to splunk web which represent timings
and statistics from each cluster identified in the original set of events as
determined by the maxspansecs window. The following fields are returned:
_time :                the start time of the cluster
cluster_end_time :     the calculated end time of the event based on the latest
                       transaction end time (transaction start + duration).
cluster_max_duration : the highest duration value from cluster transactions
cluster_mean_duration : the mean of the duration values for the cluster
As a starting point I use the following to nicely format the epoch times and float values after my base search, the transaction command, and the search duration filter above:
| clusterstats maxspansecs=30
| convert timeformat=""%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S"" ctime(cluster_end_time)
as cluster_end_time
| convert timeformat=""%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S"" ctime(cluster_last_txn_start)
as cluster_last_txn_start
| table _time cluster_end_time cluster_txn_count cluster_max_duration
cluster_mean_duration
| eval cluster_max_duration=round(cluster_max_duration,2)
| eval cluster_mean_duration=round(cluster_mean_duration,2)
| rename _time as cluster_start_time
|convert timeformat=""%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S"" ctime(cluster_start_time)
as cluster_start_time

Compatability
The app and TA extracts information and knowledge from Zeek (formerly known as Bro) via Corelight Sensors or open-source Zeek, resulting in powerful security insights through key traffic dashboards such as:

Intel: Find IOCs from external sources matched in network traffic.
Notices: See situations flagged by the Notice policy for further investigation.
IP Interrogation: Identify anomalies by reviewing top protocol usage, internal vs. external connections, top connections by bytes transferred and more.
Log Hunting: Accelerate your hunt by narrowing down many logs to only the logs that matter.
Detections: Find and respond to off-port protocol usage, IOC matches, and other potentially interesting events.
Connections: Gain situational awareness using lists of top services, ports, dataflows, originators, and responders.
HTTP: Find suspicious HTTP transactions by reviewing a list of top host headers, originators, rare user agents and rare host headers.
DNS: Detect DNS exfiltration by spotting queries to non-existent domains and high connection counts.
Files: Find executables hidden in benign extensions and compressed files.
Corelight Egress Monitor: Find risky North/South user connections to weak SSL versions.

Deployment Guide
Note: Installing the VMware EDR TA or IA on the same node as the App is an unsupported configuration that may result in instability or errors. If you are seeing the error message More than 1 VMware EDR App detected, refer to the recommendations below for which Apps/Add-ons should be installed on which node and fully delete (not just disable) extra copies of VMware EDR apps/add-ons from nodes where they are not needed. Then restart Splunk on that node.

Data Onboarding
To properly onboard the VMware CB EDR data, please follow the documentation. Once the data is configured via HEC, AWS S3, or file with UF, refer to this documentation to continue configuration.
Configuring Event Forwarder & S3 Inputs
Requirements and recommendations
The AWS add-on for Splunk is required for configuring S3 inputs. The add-on can be downloaded from Splunkbase. This add-on will be used to configure inputs for this Splunk app. Before configuring any inputs, you should create separate queues and S3 buckets for alert and endpoint events. A Carbon Black Event Forwarder must also be configured in order to forward data to the S3 buckets and to efficiently take in data, see the Event Forwarder Configuration section below.
Event Forwarder Configuration
An event forwarder must be created before any input can be received. This forwarder will be responsible for routing data to an S3 bucket where it can then be taken as input by Splunk. Configure your forwarder with filters to limit the amount of event data forwarded to Splunk in order to reduce costs. The forwarder installation guide for VMware CB EDR is located at Developer Network. It is recommended to follow the guide there, and then proceed with the installation and configuration of Splunk.
More details can be found at the CB Event Forwarder on Github.
User Guide
Initial Application Configuration
VMware Carbon Black EDR is configured from the Application Configuration menu option under the Administration menu.


VMware Base Configuration


The options configured on this page will update settings in local/eventtypes.conf.


VMware CB EDR Base Index: specify where the events from EDR will be searched. Required on the searching tier.


VMware CB EDR Action Index: specify where events generated from alert actions will be stored and/or searched. Required on the searching tier. Should be a single index. index=main




API Token Configuration

Use this tab to configure access to VMware Carbon Black EDR. The application supports multiple API Configurations to enable data from multiple Carbon Black EDR organizations to be ingested.



Alert Actions


All available alert actions will be displayed on this page.


See the Alert Actions section below for configuration details and considerations




Custom Commands

See the Custom Commands section below for configuration details and usage examples
NOTE: Do not modify any configurations in ``/default``. Doing so will cause your changes to be overwritten when the app is upgraded. If required or directed to by support, create the appropriate configuration files in ``/local`` and include the stanza attributes that are being changed.



Alert Actions


Alert Configuration Notes: The global configurations referenced below are configured under Administration/Application Configuration under the Alert Actions tab.


ALL search results that are being passed to the alert actions are required to have a host field that corresponds to the correct Organization Name as configured in the API Configuration Tab.


If you use multi-tenancy, include the host field with the corresponding value in the Splunk search query. This value is the Organization Name found in the API Token Configuration.


By default when a new alert is created in Splunk the parameter action.*.param.api_config = \<api_config guid> will be added to the savedsearches.conf file in the VMware Carbon Black EDR local directory. If you need to change credentials used on an alert action in the Application Configuration dashboard then all previously created alerts that were using the old credential needs to be changed. After updating credentials, delete the above parameter from the savedsearches.conf file for the appropriate saved search and restart Splunk.

It consists of a set of rules and dashboards for visualization of multiple security checks on Sysmon’s events of Windows hosts. It allows to detect anomalies (further analysis is needed to check if they are caused by malware, user's data leakage intentions, etc.).
Sysmon itself includes the following capabilities:
- Logs process creation with full command line for both current and parent processes.
- Records the hash of process image files using SHA1 (the default), MD5, SHA256 or IMPHASH.
- Multiple hashes can be used at the same time.
- Includes a process GUID in process create events to allow for correlation of events even when Windows reuses process IDs.
- Include a session GUID in each events to allow correlation of events on same logon session. Logs loading of drivers or DLLs with their signatures and hashes.
- Logs opens for raw read access of disks and volumes
- Optionally logs network connections, including each connection’s source process, IP addresses, port numbers, hostnames and port names.
- Detects  changesin  file  creation  time  to  understand  when  a  file  was  really created. 
- Modification  of file  create  timestamps  is  a  technique  commonly  used by malware  to cover its tracks.
- Automatically reload configuration if changed in the registry.
- Rule filtering to include or exclude certain events dynamically.
- Generates  events  from  early  in  the  boot  process  to  capture  activity  made  by even sophisticated kernel-mode malware.
Thus SYSMON Integration Framework Basic is able to provide multiple security checks on Sysmon’s events by SIEM:
- Ransomware or Data Leakage detection by alert of rapid creation of large number of new files;
- Detection of long commands (it may be obfuscated malicious code);
- Detection of processes that have cmd (powershell, cscript.exe, wscript.exe, rundll32.exe) as child process on workstations;
- Visualization of TOP non-browsers executables with direct connections to Internet;
- Anomaly detection: different files with the same hashes; rare system executable files (i.e. if cmd.exe differs on one host of your corporate environment).

Splunk app with security alerts to generate detections via Microsoft Sysmon and Windows Event Logs
This app provides alerts built with splunk search macros to detect a wide variety of suspicious activity in Windows environment. It is designed for 'blue-team' team members to identify suspicious activity in Windows environment.
Design
The app consists of a number of search macros which are also used in Splunk alerts to raise Triggered alerts. The macros are listed in Advanced Search > Search Macros with sysmon_detect_* being the detection rules leveraging Sysmon and Windows Event logs.
Other macros include:
 sysmon_search - Base search used to search Sysmon logs. Used across most detection rules. 
 winlog_search - Base search used to search Windows Event logs. Used across most detection rules.
 sysmon_rename_fields - Search used to rename/create new fields in Sysmon. Used across most detection rules.
 sysmon_rename_fields - Search used to rename/create new fields in Windows Event Logs. Used across most detection rules.
* sysmon_create_alert - Search used to add an alert to a lookup table. The fields in lookup table are based on Mitre Attack Framework
Setup
Install the app via Splunk Manage App.
Ensure that the Sysmon logs and Windows Event logs are enabled from relevant universal forwarder. 
Refer to this guide on how to forward Sysmon Logs to Splunk.
Refer to this guide on how to forward Windows Event Logs to Splunk.
By default, the app searches index=main for sourcetype=WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational (Sysmon logs) and sourcetype=WinEventLog:* (Windows Event logs).
If that is not the case, update the sysmon_search and winlog_search search macros with the log locations.
Detections
Currently, the following detections (as search macros / alerts) have been been added to this splunk app: 
 sysmon_detect_adhunttool - Detects ADHunt tool
 sysmon_detect_windows_powershell_suspicious_command_exec - Detects strings that contain suspicious powershell patterns typically associated with malware
 sysmon_detect_windows_powershell_long_command_exec - Detects very long powershell strings typically associated with malware
 sysmon_detect_windows_network_connections_beaconing - Detects regular outbound network connections/beacons
 sysmon_detect_windows_dns_connections_beaconing - Detects regular windows DNS connections/beacons
 sysmon_detect_rubeus_via_command_line_params - Detects rubeus hacking tool in the use via command line params

Overview
This application uses fields defined in the Common Information Model to harvest and display details about network traffic dropped by firewalls.  This is useful for base lining and monitoring the traffic required by applications running in protected networks (servers in a DMZ, critical systems within electronic security perimeters, etc.).  
If you have the Splunk Add-on for Cisco ASA installed, the dashboards in this application will display information about traffic dropped by Cisco ASA, Cisco PIX, and Cisco Firewall Service Module devices without any additional configuration.
Prerequisites
The following pre-requisites are required:


Firewalls you wish to monitor using the dashboards in this application must be configured to send event data about dropped traffic to Splunk.    


Field extractions must exist for the following CIM defined fields: host, src_ip, dest_ip, dest_port, transport, and action.  


Field extractions for Cisco ASA, PIX, and Firewall Service Module firewalls are available by installing the Splunk Add-on for Cisco ASA (https://apps.splunk.com/app/1620/).  Extractions for devices from other manufacturers may be added to this application in future versions, or made available by other Splunk Add-ons or Technology Adapters.


Installation
To install this app, download the file compressed tar file for the most recent version from http://www.synacktek.com/dropped-traffic.  Save this file on your system, then load it onto your Splunk server(s) by choosing Apps / Manage Apps / Install app from file.  
Click the Choose File button, and find the installation archive file you downloaded from www.synacktek.com, then click the Upload button to install the app.
Configuration
By default, the application dashboards are configured to look events that have action=blocked for the sourcetypes cisco:asa, cisco:fwsm, and cisco:pix.  If you are using different sourcetype names for your data you will need to modify the dashboard to accommodate this.
To modify the sourcetypes used by the dashboard, open the SYNACKTEK Dropped Traffic Dashboard and select Edit Source from the Edit menu in the upper-right corner of the screen.
Once the source XML is open, find the query field and modify the list of sourcetypes being queried to match what you need for your environment.  Click the Save button when your changes are complete.
Note that you can make other changes to the search criteria by editing the XML source as well.  If you want to exclude events from specific hosts, for example, you could add the text NOT host=HOST_TO_BE_REMOVED in the query field.
Use Cases
The dashboards included in this application are designed for hardening and monitoring secure systems within your larger enterprise network; security zones where you can quantify the expected inbound and outbound traffic you should see traversing your security boundaries.  
Events generated by security devices connected to the public Internet may generate a lot of noise and reduce the effectiveness of the dashboards; you may need to modify the dashboards to omit events from edge devices.
The following are some specific use cases this where this application can be best used:
System Hardening – When implementing a new system in a secured environment it can be difficult to identify all the traffic that needs to be white-listed in your security devices.  More often than not, this becomes a trial-and-error process that requires security engineers to monitor traffic attempting to traverse a firewall, then either adding policies to permit the traffic or disabling the unneeded services which are generating the traffic.  The dashboards provided in this application make it easy to find traffic being dropped by source, destination, or frequency so it can be addressed.
NERC CIP ESP Monitoring – ICS and Control Center networks used to support NERC CIP assets for electrical utilities require comprehensive monitoring to detect unexpected traffic.  Luckily, the traffic footprints in these environments can be made very predictable.  By capturing events from your electronic access points and displaying them in the dashboards provided by this app you can quickly detect unauthorized traffic and determine its source.
Misconfiguration / Malicious Traffic Detection – Once your secure systems and security policies are normalized, you should see very little unexpected traffic being dropped by your security devices.  Spikes in dropped traffic are typically either an indication of a misconfigured device, or the result of malicious traffic trying to cross your security boundaries.  These spikes are easy to identify using the dashboards provided in this app. 
To Do List
The following is a list of updates we plan to make available to users of this application in the future:
-   Provide field extractions (or links to other technology adapters) for additional network security devices

Addition of a configuration page that will eliminate the need to manually edit the XML source code for the dashboards

Splunk Enterprise is the leading platform for real-time operational intelligence. When you download Splunk Enterprise for free, you get a Splunk Enterprise license for 60 days that lets you index up to 500 megabytes of data per day.
When the free trial ends, you can convert to a perpetual Free license or purchase an Enterprise license to continue using the expanded functionality designed for multi-user deployments.
Dashboards
System Info
This Dashboard contains information on the FreeNAS system(s)


Inputs
For this app to work completely the REST API Modular Input is required, install the REST app first (thanks to the awesome Damien Dallimore)
FreeNAS API
http://api.freenas.org/index.html
This app utilises the FreeNAS api for some data.
Check either inputs.conf, or if you are a novice you can just change the details in the “data inputs” section of Splunk.
You will need to configure for your environment;

Your FreeNAS IP address or host name
Your FreeNAS ROOT password (currently the FreeNAS API only allows the root user)

.SH files
There are several .sh scripts in /TA-SH_files_for_FreeNAS directory that need to be placed on a persistent dataset on the FreeNAS server with a cron job associated with them, set to run every few minutes.
https://doc.freenas.org/9.3/freenas_tasks.html
these scripts output to “logger” - which is the syslog output
Also once copied over this command may be your friend :)
chmod 777 foo.sh
Syslog
You need to configure FreeNAS to log to a central server (Splunk®) for the data to be ingested, point to port 1514 e.g. 
192.168.1.2:1514

https://doc.freenas.org/9.3/freenas_system.html#general

This technology add-on gathers capacity, general and health data regarding your Splunk environment.  It can send the data to our team of Splunk Certified Consultants at RTP Technology Inc. if you choose to do so.  Otherwise you can use the saved searches in the app for your own diagnosis.
If you do choose to submit your data to RTP Technology Inc., you will be contacted by an account representative who will schedule a follow up presentation whereby a RTP Consultant will review the Health Check results with you and/or your team.
Installation Instructions:

Install the app 
Open the app
You will be asked to configure the app on first run (if this is not the first run, you will need to click on setup)
Enter your contact details, and select the appropriate options
Click Save
Wait for Splunk to tell you a restart is needed, and then restart splunk
Thats it, Sending your data to RTP Technology is a one time automated process that occurs when you restart Splunk. 

After restarting, splunk will execute the saved searches and create lookups which are then sent to RTP Technology Inc., along with your contact details (assuming you agreed to the license, selected the options to send data and didn't select ""I dont have internet""). 
If you do not accept the license agreement or do not check a box to send any data, then no searches will execute and no data will be sent when you restart splunk.  
If you select ""I do not have internet"" then you must manually send the data found here, $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Splunk_TA_RTP-Health-Checker/lookups/offline_package.tar.gz, to RTP Technology. You can send it to Splunk@RTPTech.com or call (201) 796-2266 and ask to speak with someone on the Splunk team for more options or any other questions you may have.
As a final step to all of the above scenarios, when Splunk is restarted for the first time after installing the app, the scripted input will execute a python script that disables the scripted input. Except if you did not select to send any data, in which case the scripted input never gets enabled.
Troubleshooting:
The application logs to index=_internal.  You can find any errors or exceptions using this search: index=_internal rtp*.  If you do experience any difficulties, please contact us at Splunk@RTPTech.com or by telephone at (201) 796-2266.",Version 1.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/0848b3a8-5114-11e7-8d3f-02f13bdc2585.png,"IT Operations, Utilities",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,155,0,splunk,5,3,Michael Bentley,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/jkat54,"Products: Splunk Enterprise

The product is delivered with a host of modular inputs for receiving Ziften endpoint agent data and currently populates a multitude of the Common Information Model (CIM) data models. The backend is now supported by Apache Kafka and uses Splunk's HTTP Event Collector (HEC) to achieve increased performance.
The Ziften Zenith Add-on also includes Adaptive Response actions that can be taken on endpoints running the Ziften Zenith agent. This version includes actions to kill processes and quarantine systems from network access. In addition to these standard actions, custom actions are also able to be added for anything scriptable in Powershell or Bash (contact Ziften for details).
Installation:

Install the Ziften Zenith Add-on available on Splunkbase at https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1872/.
    a. During the install process you will be prompted for a VirusTotal key. (You will need to get a key to use the VirusTotal feature of the app. This can be added later by clicking on Manage App and choose the setup option)
Enable the Global HTTP Event Collector (HEC) in Splunk Data Inputs if not already done. (Note: In order to use HTTPS with the HTTP Event Collector, your Splunk system must have a valid certificate for Zenith to communicate)
Create a new HTTP Event Collector token (A sample token was created, this can be used for testing if desired)
    a. Give the new input a name
    b. For sourcetype choose Select and pick 'ziften:zenith:hec'
    c. Index and other parameters are optional to your environment
In the Ziften Zenith console, configure the Splunk integration settings by navigating to Admin -> System Configuration -> Splunk Forwarding.
    a. Set FEATURE_SPLUNK_ENABLED to ""True""
    b. Set SPLUNK_URL to your Splunk instance's URL and use the HTTP Event Collector URI /services/collector and port (default is 8088). Your entry would look like http://<IP_ADDRESS_OR_HOSTNAME>:8088/services/collector
    c Set SPLUNK TOKEN to the Splunk HEC token you just created",Version 2.1.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/a9a5c056-61cc-11e7-9237-02f13bdc2585.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",http://ziften.com/end-user-license-agreement-third-party-content/,762,0,splunk,5,4,Ziften Support,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/ziftensplunk,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

This app looks at clamav and freshclam log files to report on usage, scan summary, and virus' discovered.

ClamAV (https://www.clamav.net/). ClamAV® is an open source antivirus engine for detecting trojans, viruses, malware & other malicious threats.
ClamAV is a registred trademark of Sourcefire, Inc. and Cisco Technology, Inc.

The author of this splunk app has no connection whatsoever with ClamAV, Sourcefire, and or Cisco. Other, than I think it's a f'ing cool product and no-one else has made a splunk app for its logs. :)
Getting Started
This app has been created to work correctly with a stand-alone, distributed, and cloud installs of Splunk. Read the install notes carefully below with your splunk platform in mind.
You will need two apps:

This App provides filtering logic (whitelisting) for events in Splunk. It has been originally
developped to migrate from Alert Manager Suppression rule (https://github.com/alertmanager/alert_manager) to Splunk Enterprise Security and not losing the whitelisting work that has been done previously, but you can use Event Masker on every dashboard or query in Splunk search bar.
Event Masker consists in multiple components:

A custom search command (mask). The command take three arguments :
the scope of the mask rule, the scope on the command must match the scope defined in the Event Masker Rules
the log argument (true/t or  false/f) that specifies whether to log or not the masking made by the command. It is true by default.
the timefield argument used only when you set a startDate and endDate to mask events on a specific timerange.
A kv store lookup that contains the masking rules
A masking rules editor
Audit logs to track events that were masked by the command. These logs are pushed daily from the _internal index
   to the _audit index with the help of a scheduled report (mask_command_logs_audit) to benefit from a longer
   retention.
Dashboards to audit the masking and check the masking rules
A workflow action from Enterprise Security to facilitate whitelisting from a notable. It will extract fields from the notable raw in order to fill Event Masker form. 

For documentation, see https://github.com/scrt/event_masker
We also published articles about Event Masker and its features on our blog, see https://blog.scrt.ch/category/analytics-2/
Configuring Splunk
Install this app into Splunk Searh Head (standalone) by doing the following:

Log in to Splunk Web and navigate to ""Apps » Manage Apps"" via the app dropdown at the top left of Splunk's user
   interface
Click the ""install app from file"" button
Upload the file by clicking ""Choose file"" and selecting the app
Click upload

When update this app, please restart Splunk. Some time, you need to refresh Splunk cache (https://<your_splunk_url>/en-US/_bump)
Command usage
Once the app is installed, you can open ""Event Masker"" app from the main launcher. You need to create at least 1 rule to use it.
Once the masking rule has been created, just add the following command at the very end of the Splunk Savedsearch/Correlation search. Transforming command must be used at the left of this command.
index=<index> | table <field1>, <field2> | mask scope=<the_scope_of_the_created_masking_rule>
If you have set startDate and endDate fields, you must set timefield option. You should write the name of your time field with the format %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f.
Example :
index=<index> | table <field1>, <field2>, _time_ | eval _time=strftime(_time,""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f"") |mask scope=<the_scope_of_the_created_masking_rule> timefield=""_time""
The search will be launched and if everything is correct, the events that were to be masking should not appear in the set of results. 
To check that the masking rule and the search have been correctly implemented, go to the Event Masker Logs
dashboard. 
You have to know : If conditions, validity perriod or error occurs, Event Masker return splunk search without modification.
Usage information
By default, you need to be Splunk Admin (admin group) or Enterprise Security Admin (ess_admin group) to see Event Masker and make modifications on rules. To give read-only capabilities to a specific user, you have to add it in Enterprise Security Analyst or User groups (ess_analyst or ess_user). 
To ensure that application logging works as expected, the groups mentioned previously (admin and ess_admin) needs to have the right to write in _internal index. This capability will provide logs regarding modifications made by users on Event Masker rules. 
In Event Masker Rules list (default page):
 Add rule need at least title and scope
 Renaming a rule has no impact in mask command
 To use multiple rule as the same time, you can use the same scope as another rule and use it in mask command
 AND rule need at least 2 conditions
 To edit a rule, click on title field
 ""Start Date"" and ""End date"" are available to filter your events with a specific timerange. You must use timefield option to do that. If you not set these fields, your rule will mask events all the time. 
* Import file must have the following JSON format :
   [
    {
      ""title"": ""rule1"",

          ""comment"": ""My comment on my condition""
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
Do not forget that fields title, scope and match_type are mandatory (and conditions, of course)
In Event Masker rule editor (edit conditions):
 Right click on the table displays a context menu that enables you to add/delete a row or copy/paste data. You can also save as CSV the table and order data by headers.
 Values can be copied from splunk search result and pasted in the table bellow. This add row automatically.
 Use ""fieldname"" (without quotes) to refer to a field from results
 By default, values are case insensitive
Do not forget : All of the conditions must be true for a valid application. Make sure it works by testing your rules (for example : search * | table myfield | mask scope=""rule scope"")
Known Limitations


Splunk multi-value (MV) field are supported by Event Masker but at this time, masking rule hide the whole line when conditions are matched.


It is possible that importing and exporting takes time and freeze the browser. This will be patched in a future version but for now, take the opportunity to have a coffee :coffee:

NTPDrifter is a splunkapp that you deploy to a universal forwarder to measure the NTP drift between the
servers local clock and the time given by your local NTP source.
It does not correct for any time difference, it just tells you what it is so you can do somthing about it.
Some suggested Ways to use the data are given at the bottom of this readme.
Version History:

v1.0 24th Nov 2012 - Initial release
v1.2 29th Nov 2012 - Removed Client/location specifc dependancies/quirks for upload to splunkbase
v1.3 6th  Aug 2013 - Numerous spelling corrections,alert search syntax tweak, update for release of new Splunk Apps site.

Tested ok on:
Windows XP Professional
Windows 7
Windows 2003 R2
Windows 2008 R2
Requirements:
cscript.exe must be available on your target hosts
NTP Source hostname must be edited into the VB script as indicated.
Target hosts must be able to query NTP ie no firewall.
CAUTION - Standard disclaimer applies in this case.
This script/SplunkApp has no brain, so you must use your own before executing it.
I accept no liablilty for damage to your or any one elses computer network system as a result of using this app.
You use this app at your own risk.
Copyright 2012
Conradejohnston@gmail.com
Deployment:
Deploy using deployment server to target your windows servers as required.
Splunk Requirements:
The app will write its data to an index named ""windows_perfmon""
Sourcetype is ntp_drift
I have the interval set to 360s. This way you can see the servers drifting inbetween NTP sync operations
All these settings can be changed to suit your situation and needs.
The location of the script is assumed to be the default install location.
Usage: ##
General Purpose Daily Report
Generate a daily report style email giving you the top n-outliers in either direction.
index=windows_perfmon sourcetype=""ntp_drift"" host=""<HOSTMASK>"" | head 500 | dedup host | rex ""(?i):ntpDrift=(?P<ntpDrift>[^\]]+)"" | sort +ntpDrift, +host | reverse | head 10 | append [ search index=windows_perfmon sourcetype=""ntp_drift"" host=""ps*"" | head 500 | dedup host | rex ""(?i):ntpDrift=(?P<ntpDrift>[^\]]+)"" | sort +ntpDrift, +host | head 10 | sort -ntpDrift ] | table host, ntpDrift
Configure this as a scheduled search that emails you once a day. Thius way you get the benefit of a daily heath report and get to see what the extreme outliers are.
Targetted Alert
If you don't want a daily repor; You could configure an alert to only notify you whenever a host or hosts exceed a maximum variance from source for a given time.
Historical Tracking
The data can also be graphed overtime to show how well (or not so well) your servers are tracking and whether you need tweak your NTP polling periods. Interesting to see that not all servers track time as closely asor uniformly as you might think!.
index=windows_perfmon sourcetype=""ntp_drift"" host=""<HOSTMASK>"" | eval host=lower(host) | rex ""(?i):ntpDrift=(?P<ntpDrift>[^\]]+)"" | timechart span=6min max(ntpDrift) by host
Choose line chart, labels and time period to suit. Long time periods may reuqire you to tweak the span component to reduce data points.  (see example screenshot - hostnames blurred for modesty)

Prerequisites - This application is dependent on version 1.1.0 of CloudKnox Add-on for Splunk (TA-CloudKnox)
Compatible with:
Splunk Enterprise version: 7.3.x and 8.0.x
CloudKnox API v2
OS: Platform independent
Browser: Safari, Chrome and Firefox



Release Notes Version 1.1.0

Added support for CloudKnox alerts
Added alert that triggers when a new super identity is indexed in Splunk

Upgrade Steps
No special steps are required to upgrade the CloudKnox App for Splunk from version 1.0.0 to version 1.1.0.
RECOMMENDED SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

Standard Splunk configuration

TOPOLOGY AND SETTING UP SPLUNK ENVIRONMENT


This app has been distributed in two parts.

CloudKnox Add-on for Splunk, which collects data from CloudKnox using REST API calls.
CloudKnox App for Splunk, which adds dashboards to visualize the CloudKnox data



This app can be set up in two ways:

Standalone Mode:
Install the CloudKnox App for Splunk and CloudKnox Add-on for Splunk.
The CloudKnox App for Splunk uses the data collected by CloudKnox Add-on for Splunk and builds dashboards on it.


Distributed Environment:
Install the CloudKnox App for Splunk and CloudKnox Add-on for Splunk on the search head. User does not need to configure an account or create an input in CloudKnox Add-on for Splunk on search head.
Install only CloudKnox Add-on for Splunk on the heavy forwarder. User needs to configure account and needs to create data input to collect data from CloudKnox.
User needs to manually create an index on the indexer (No need to install CloudKnox App for Splunk or CloudKnox Add-on for Splunk on indexer).





INSTALLATION
CloudKnox App for Splunk can be installed through UI using ""Manage Apps"" > ""Install app from file"" or by extracting tarball directly into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ folder.
CONFIGURATION
Configure Macros:
Follow the below steps to configure the macros:

Go to ""Settings"" > ""Advanced search"" > ""Search macros"".
Select ""CloudKnox App for Splunk"" in ""App"" context dropdown.
Click on cloudknox(2) macro from the shown table.
In the macro definition default value will be index=""main"" sourcetype=""cloudknox:$authSystemtype$:$category$"". Update the definition with the index you used for data collection and save the configurations. For example: index=""<your_index_name>"" sourcetype=""cloudknox:$authSystemtype$:$category$"".
Search cloudknoxindex macro and repeat the above step. The user is required to configure this macro in order to user the ""cloudknox_super_identities_alert"".
Next search cloudknox_url_without_scheme macro and replace ""xyz.cloudknox.io"" with the URL of your CloudKnox instance. The user is required to configure this macro in order to use the drill-down functionality in the ""CloudKnox Alerts"" dashboard.

Note: If the user has selected a default index (Note: By default, Splunk considers only main index as default index) in ""Data Input"" configuration during CloudKnox Add-on for Splunk's configuration step, then no need to perform steps 3, 4 and 5.
Configure Savedsearches:
This App contains below 2 schedule searches:
 cloudknox_super_identities_snapshot: This savedsearch updates cloudknox_si_snapshot KV store lookup to contain the latest super identities.
 cloudknox_super_identities_alert: This alert is generated when any new super identity is added.
Configuring savedsearches is only required if the user wishes to use ""cloudknox_super_identities_alert"" which triggers an alert when a new super identity is indexed in Splunk. Follow the below steps to configure the savedsearches:

Navigate to Settings > Searches, reports, and alerts
Find ""cloudknox_super_identities_snapshot"" search
Click on Edit > Edit Schedule
Enable the search and optionally update the ""Schedule"" and ""Time Range"" as per the requirement.
Thereafter find the ""cloudknox_super_identities_alert"" alert
Click on Edit > Edit Alert
Optionally modify the ""Time Range"" and ""Cron Expression"" as per the requirement
Add appropriate action to perform when the alert is triggered
Click ""Save"" to update the settings and enable the alert

TROUBLESHOOTING

If you do not see any results in search then check whether you have correctly configured index in the cloudknox(2) macro. Also you can verify if the data is there in the index by running the search query index=""<your_index_name>"" source=""cloudknox"".

UNINSTALL & CLEANUP STEPS

Remove $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/CloudKnoxAppforSplunk
To reflect the cleanup changes in UI, restart Splunk instance. Refer https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.0.6/Admin/StartSplunk documentation to get information on how to restart Splunk.

Note: $SPLUNK_HOME denotes the path where Splunk is installed. Ex: /opt/splunk

Specifically props_config_lookup, props_score_raw, & stitch_props_trans. The section is the following eval
| eval sourcetype = if(isnull(sourcetype), title, sourcetype)
should be changed to something like this - previous Splunk 6x versions could probably work with just the len statement but left isnull in just in case
| eval sourcetype = if(isnull(sourcetype) OR len(sourcetype)<1, title, sourcetype)
Whereas apps like Splunk on Splunk are designed to help the Splunk admin understand what is happening with their deployment at an engine level, this app is designed to help the Splunk admin understand and assess the maturity of their deployment at a data level. 
Splunk 6.x is required due to frequently used internal REST searches, use of the foreach command, and the changes to simple xml.
No new indices are created though there are 3 scheduled searches which ship enabled. Once the app is installed it might take a few hours before a few of the panels will show data. As everyone's environment is different from both a data and hardware perspective there are 2 dashboards under Knowledge Management to help you assess the coverage these searches provide relative to search frequency and length. You may find the searches need to be tweaked.
The props and field extraction score methodologies are documented in the app. At a high level there are 7 props settings that should be assigned to each sourcetype to help Splunk onboard your data - this app looks for their presence. On the field extraction side a comparison is made between the combined byte length of fields to the byte length of _raw. This is admittedly not a perfect science; however, it allows you to make a high level judgment on how much field definition is taking place on a sourcetype by sourcetype basis.",Version 1.3,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/image/default_icon.png,"IT Operations, Utilities",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,"1,481",0,splunk,5,4,Mark Runals,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/Runals,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

The Upgrade Readiness App checks for:
-   Python 3 incompatible code in custom Mako templates.
-   Python scripts that might fail in Python 3.
-   Lower versions of jQuery prior to jQuery 3.5.
-   Templates and dashboards with versions lower than 1.1.
-   References to JavaScript files that Splunk software does not support.
In clustered environments, the app performs these checks on search heads and indexers and provides a merged report with remediation steps.
Which apps does the scan include
This app scans all apps and add-ons in the  $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps  and  $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/slave-apps  directories, with some exceptions. The app scans private apps that you have created for your own organization, as well as public apps installed from Splunkbase, including third-party apps and Splunk supported apps.
Python version switch on Splunk Cloud Platform
On the Splunk Cloud Platform version of the app, the Python Version tab is enabled by default for the  sc_admin  role. This lets Splunk Cloud Platform admins see the current default Python version of the cluster and, if the default version is Python 2, request an upgrade to Python 3. All upgrade requests made by the user are listed on the page.
When you request an upgrade from Python 2 to Python 3, the application sends a request to Splunk Support to upgrade the default version of Python across the entire cluster
Install the Upgrade Readiness App
Install the Upgrade Readiness App on all instances of your Splunk platform deployment that run apps or on a single test Splunk platform instance with all your apps installed on it.
The Upgrade Readiness app is installed by default on Splunk Enterprise version 8.2 and higher. If you are on a Splunk Enterprise version prior to 8.2 but after 7.3, you can download the Python Upgrade Readiness App from Splunkbase and install it on your deployment.
The Upgrade Readiness app is installed by default on Splunk Cloud Platform version 8.2.2107 and higher. You do not need to install or update the app on Splunk Cloud Platform.
Requirements

Splunk Enterprise version 7.3, 8.0, 8.1, or 8.2, or Splunk Cloud Platform version 8.2.2107 or higher.
Installed apps or add-ons.
KV store must be enabled.
A role must hold the  admin_all_objects  capability to install the app on Splunk Enterprise. The admin role holds this capability by default.
Consider increasing the splunkd session timeout value, depending on the number of custom apps in the environment.

Install the app on a search head cluster
To install the app on a search head cluster, use the deployer. For detailed instructions, see  Use the deployer to distribute apps and configuration updates  in the  Distributed Search  manual.
Performance considerations
The Upgrade Readiness App generates a final report that includes all apps after a few cycles of scanning.
On Splunk Enterprise, since the app scanning process runs asynchronously, there is no visible impact on the performance of standalone instances.
On Splunk Cloud Platform, apps that exist only on the remote location do not immediately appear in scan results. All data from all apps on the remote instance will be available in the final merged report after a few scans.
Note that the user session timeout limit is 60 minutes by default. To ensure the user session does not timeout during the app scan, increase the session timeout limit before scanning large numbers of apps, as mentioned in the requirements section.
Manage permissions for the Upgrade Readiness App
After you install the Upgrade Readiness App, you must grant permissions to any roles other than admin that you want to allow to run scans.
Prerequisite
To edit app permissions in Splunk Enterprise, your role must hold the  admin_all_objects  capability. The admin role holds this capability by default. To edit app permissions in Splunk Cloud Platform, you must have the  sc_admin  role.
To grant permission to roles to run scans:
1.  In Splunk Web, click the Apps gear icon.
2.  In the row for the Splunk Python Upgrade Readiness App, click  Permissions.
3.  Under App permissions, select the check box under  Write  for all roles that you want to grant permission to run scans.
4.  Click  Save.
Scan a Splunk platform instance with the Splunk Upgrade Readiness App
Prerequisites
To run scans, a role must hold the  admin_all_objects  capability. See  Manage permissions for the Upgrade Readiness App. Also ensure that the KV store is enabled.
Make sure to take performance factors into consideration. See  Install the Upgrade Readiness App.
The Upgrade Readiness App no longer supports manual scans.
To scan your Splunk platform instance:
1.  The Upgrade Readiness App automatically scans all apps daily by default. The Python scan runs at 1 AM, and the jQuery scan runs at 4 PM. Scan results appear automatically after the scan completes.
2.  Review the scan results for each app in the Python and jQuery tabs.
3.  (Optional) Click  Export Results  to export your scan results. You can choose to export in JSON format.
4.  (Optional) Click  Email Result  to email your scan results. Make sure to configure email settings.
5.  Dismiss any failed files in your private applications if you want to mark it as an exception.
You can also run scans using the REST API. For more information, see the  REST API reference for the Upgrade Readiness App.
Some Splunk apps are too large to scan. If you cannot scan a Splunk app, refer to the app's documentation for updates.
Schedule a scan
The Upgrade Readiness App scans all apps daily by default. The Python scan runs at 1 AM, and the jQuery scan runs at 4 PM. You can modify the app scan schedule, as follows:
1.  In Splunk Web, launch the Upgrade Readiness App.
2.  Select either the Python or jQuery tab to modify that scheduled scan.
3.  Click  Manage Scan Schedule.
4.  Select  Scan my apps on a custom schedule, then specify the scan interval.
5.  Click  Save.
The scan schedule applies to both local search heads and remote indexers.
Disable the scan
You can disable the scan at any time, as follows:
1.  Click  Manage Scan Schedule.
2.  Select  Turn Scan Off.
3.  Click  Save.
    Your request is saved to the KV store, but the schedule change can take up to 2 hours to be reflected on the indexing tier.
After you disable the scan, you must explicitly enable it to rerun the scan at the defined interval. Changing the schedule in the Manage Scan Schedule dialog does not reenable the scan. Any modification to the scan schedule will be reflected on indexers (remote instances) and search heads (local instances) after 2 hours.
Disable app list updates
The Upgrade Readiness App pulls Splunkbase apps and metadata daily 7 minutes past every 8th hour. You can disable automatic app list updates, as follows:
1.  Click  Settings > Data inputs > Scripts.
2.  Find the  pura_get_all_apps.py  script in  python_upgrade_readiness_app.
3.  Click  Disable.
Disabling app list updates applies to standalone instances and not to Splunk Cloud Platform.
Act on Python scan results with the Upgrade Readiness App
After you scan your Splunk platform instance with the Upgrade Readiness app, you can review and act on the results to prepare your deployment for Python 3.
Public Apps
Review and act on the scan results for all of your public apps. Public apps are apps that are available on Splunkbase.
The Upgrade Readiness App scan results of public apps include Splunk-supported apps and third-party apps supported by partners and developers. App owners are responsible for updating their apps and releasing new versions that meet the upgrade readiness requirements of the Splunk Enterprise Python 3 release.
If you've extended an app or customized anything locally, review the results for any custom file paths that you've added to that app and take action on those to prepare for the upgrade. Otherwise, you can wait for the app owner to make updates.
For third-party apps, you can contact the developer directly using their contact details on Splunkbase to learn more about their upgrade plans. If the developer does not plan to update the app, you can make the updates yourself using the guidance in the private scan checks.
If you have a version of a public app that is not compatible with Splunk Enterprise 8.0 and higher and Python 3, but a compatible version is available, then the scan results will direct you to download that version from Splunkbase to pass the check.
The Public App status will fail and display a warning icon for any public app that does not have a version available in the splunkbase.csv list. This list is shipped with the app and updated at 7 minutes past every 8th hour in a sync to Splunkbase. In the event that a connection to Splunkbase fails, the most recent or the shipped .csv will be used in respective order as a failsafe.
Private apps
Review and act on the scan results for all of your private apps. Private apps are apps that are private to your organization and not available on Splunkbase.
Resolve blocking issues in your private apps and your customized Splunkbase apps, if any, as these will block successful upgrade to the Splunk Enterprise Python 3 release. Check all other file paths flagged by the app and determine what actions you must take to make them upgrade ready.
If one or more checks in an app is marked ""SKIPPED"", this means that the Upgrade Readiness App wasn't able to complete the check due to the way the app is packaged. You can repackage the app using the Splunk Packaging Toolkit and run the scan again, or check for the upgrade compatibility issues manually. For more information, see  Overview of the Splunk Packaging Toolkit  on the Splunk developer portal.
Apps that are compatible with Splunk Enterprise 8.0 and higher, and Python 3, are marked as ""PASSED"", and you might not need to take any further action. It is still recommended to test the app thoroughly.
Update Mako templates
In the Splunk Enterprise Python 3 release, some app server components of Splunk Web will use the Python 3.7 interpreter. Update all Mako templates to be Python 3 compatible so they will work on Splunk Web in the new release. If you want the app to continue to work on previous Splunk platform releases, make the syntax dual compatible with Python 2 and 3. If your organization requires you to remove Python 2 syntax completely by a certain date, you can rewrite the Mako templates to use dual-compatible syntax as an intermediate step during your upgrade process, then rewrite them to use Python 3 syntax at a later time.
Update all other Python files
The Splunk Enterprise Python 3 release will initially include interpreters for both Python 2 and 3. In that release, for all Python code not dependent on Splunk Web or the app server, Splunk platform administrators can choose to use either interpreter by default and on a script-by-script basis. In a later release, Splunk plans to remove the Python 2 interpreter.
As a best practice, update Python files in your apps to be compatible with both Python 2 and 3 so that they are backwards compatible with previous releases, compatible with either Python interpreter in the Splunk Enterprise Python 3 release, and compatible with future releases when the Splunk platform removes the Python 2 interpreter. If your organization requires you to remove Python 2 syntax completely by a certain schedule, rewrite them using Python 3 syntax.
To make Python scripts dual compatible, use a Python 2/3 compatibility utility such as six, provided by the Python Software Foundation. For more about the six library, see  https://pypi.org/project/six/.
If the Upgrade Readiness App identifies one or more Python scripts that are used in scripted alerts, convert those scripted alerts to custom alert actions. Scripted alerts are deprecated and might not work in future releases of the Splunk platform.
Act on jQuery scan results with the Upgrade Readiness App
After you scan your Splunk platform instance with the Upgrade Readiness app, you can review and act on the results to remove dependencies on lower versions of jQuery from your deployment.
Public Apps
Review and act on the scan results for all your public apps. Public apps are apps that are available on Splunkbase.
The Upgrade Readiness App scan results include Splunk-supported apps and third-party apps supported by partners and developers. App owners are responsible for updating their apps and releasing new versions after removing jQuery vulnerabilities.
If you've extended an app or customized anything locally, review the results for any custom file paths that you've added to that app and take action on those to prepare for the upgrade. Otherwise, you can wait for the app owner to make updates.
For third-party apps, you can contact the developer directly using their contact details on Splunkbase to learn more about their upgrade plans. If the developer does not plan to update the app, you can make the updates yourself using the guidance in the private scan checks.
If you have a version of a public app that is failing, but a compatible version is available on Splunkbase, then the scan results will direct you to download that version from Splunkbase to pass the check.
The Public App status will fail and display a warning icon for any public app that does not have a version available in the splunkbase.csv list. This list is shipped with the app and updated at 7 minutes past every 8th hour in a sync to SplunkbaseIn the event that a connection to Splunkbase fails, the most recent or the shipped .csv will be used in respective order as a failsafe.
Private Apps
Review and act on the scan results for all your private apps. Private apps are apps that are private to your organization and not available on Splunkbase.
Resolve blocking issues in your private apps and your customized Splunkbase apps, if any. Check all other file paths flagged by the app and determine what actions to take to make them upgrade ready.
You can repackage the app using the Splunk Packaging Toolkit and run the scan again, or check for the upgrade compatibility issues manually. See Overview of the Splunk Packaging Toolkit on the Splunk developer portal for more information.
If one or more checks in an app is marked ""SKIPPED"", this means that the Upgrade Readiness App wasn't able to complete the check due to the way the app is packaged. You can repackage the app using the Splunk Packaging Toolkit and run the scan again, or check for the upgrade compatibility issues manually. For more information, see  Overview of the Splunk Packaging Toolkit  on the Splunk developer portal.
Apps that have no jQuery vulnerabilities are marked as ""PASSED"", and you might not need to take any further action. It is still recommended to test the app thoroughly.
Public and Private apps
Review and act on the scan results with methods that apply to both public and private apps.
Dismiss file paths
The Upgrade Readiness App lets you dismiss individual file paths from the scan results. Dismiss file paths after you verify that they have no jQuery vulnerabilities to narrow down the list to files that still require attention.
When you dismiss a file path, you'll be able to see such file in a separate table and they won't be accounted as a failure in subsequent scans.
Dismiss apps
The Upgrade Readiness App lets you dismiss both public and private apps from the scan results. Dismiss apps after you verify that they have no jQuery vulnerabilities to narrow down the list to apps that still require attention.
When you dismiss an app, that app will be marked as an Exception and it won't be accounted as a failure in the subsequent scans. You'll still be able to execute scans on that app and view results.
Reinstating dismissed file
Take one of the following actions if you accidentally dismiss an app or file path and want to reinstate it in future scans:
-   Delete the Upgrade Readiness App from your Splunk platform instance and then reinstall it.
-   Run the following command in the Search & Reporting app to recover all the file paths you have ever dismissed:
    | outputlookup jra_remote_dismiss_file
-   Run the following command in the Search & Reporting app to recover all the apps you have ever dismissed:
    | outputlookup jra_remote_dismiss_app
Disable email notification
The Upgrade Readiness App sends an email notification to the  admin  or  sc_admin  users, which summarizes the count of failed apps during the latest scan. The notification is sent at 6 AM every Monday based on the Splunk system time zone. You can disable email notification, as follows:
1.  In Splunk Web, click  Settings > Data inputs > Script.
2.  Search for the  pura_send_email.py  script in  python_upgrade_readiness_app  and click  Disable.
Release notes for the Splunk Python Upgrade Readiness App

Who is this app for?
This app is for dashboard designers who want to compactly display parent-child relationships in their data.
How does the app work?
This app provides a visualization that you can use in your own apps and dashboards.
To use it in your dashboards, simply install the app, and create a search that provides the values you want to display.
Usecases for the Tree View Visualization:
 Grouping categories together, e.g. sourcetypes by host
 Providing a compact interface for generating tokens for drill-downs in a dashboard
 Creating a menu in a set of dashboards
 Visualizing the layout of files, running process, or perfmon stats on multiple hosts
The following fields can be used in the search:
 id (required): An identifier for the lable. Use this value when assigning child items. Will default to the label if not supplied.
 label (required): The value shown next to the item.
 parentid (optional): Sets the parent item based on id. Will create a parent folder with the same label as the ID if one doesn't already exist.
 iconFolder (optional): When using ""custom"" style, selects icon for folders.
* iconDoc (optional): When using ""custom"" style, selects icon for child items.
Example Search
index=_internal
| stats count by sourcetype, source
| rename source as id, sourcetype as parentId
| eval label = id
| table id, label, parentId
Tokens
Tokens are generated each time you click an item. This can be useful if you want to populate another panel on the dashboard with a custom search, or link to a new dashboard with the tokens carying across.

Label text : This is the display name of the selected item. Default value: $tv_label_token$
ID : This is the value of the selected group you clicked. Default value: $tv_id_token$
Parent ID : This is the value of the selected group you clicked. Default value: $tv_parent_id_token$

The following standard Splunk drill-down tokens are also generated:

row.label : The Label text
row.id : The ID
row.parentid : The parent ID
row.<fieldname> : the field ""fieldname"" from the search results.

Release Notes
v 1.1.0
 New option to have all folders open when the visualization starts. Options - General - Initial State = Closed / Open, Based on user request
 Added app manifest for Splunk Cloud
 Fixed some issues with drill-downs
 AppInspect now passes
v 1.0.0

Splunk (as of the time of writing in January 2019) has no native ability to use version control on its knowledge objects. This can lead to issues where an object is accidentally changed or deleted and there is no way to restore them beyond using OS-level backups, which are difficult to use in a search head cluster.
How does the app function?
The app uses two modular inputs to back up and restore configurations, Splunk Version Control Backup (or splunkversioncontrol_backup) and and Splunk Version Control Restore (or splunkversioncontrol_restore).
The backup portion of the app provides a Splunk modular input with the ability to serialize various Splunk knowledge objects into JSON format, which is then stored in a remote git repository and tagged based on each change to the backup.
These two inputs do not have to be on the same machine, however, they must be pointing to the same git repository and the gitTempDir must be unique on the filesystem if sharing the same machine.
The restore portion provides a Splunk modular input and a dashboard (SplunkVersionControl Restore) that can be used to request the restoration of a knowledge object.
How do I restore a knowledge object?
Use the SplunkVersionControl Restore dashboard to request that a knowledge object be restored to a prior version. You must be the author of the knowledge objects you wish to restore, or have the admin role. The application with the knowledge object in it must still exist on the Splunk server.
There are two unique dashboards with two different restoration methods, the original version is described below:
When a knowledge object restore is requested the dashboard (SplunkVersionControl Restore) outputs the knowledge object information to a lookup with the definition splunkversioncontrol_restorelist. The modular input then triggers the restore based on the contents of this lookup, the modular input either creates or updates the knowledge object with the requested git tag, or logs the failure to find the object in the logs.
Note that the above option is the option used with Splunk Cloud, the below option can be used on on-prem instances...
The newer dynamic version follows a similar process, but instead of adding the knowledge object restore information to a lookup file it runs a Splunk custom command postversioncontrolrestore that hits a REST endpoint on either a local or a remote server.
The REST endpoint then performs a few functions:
- Queries the source system and passes in the authentication token of the current user, this includes restore information and the splunkversioncontrol_restore input stanza name
- The remote system then sends a query back to the source ip it received the request from, using the token to check the username logged in
- The remote system then looks up the login information for the relevant splunkversioncontrol_restore input stanza and runs a remote query against it
- The said remote query runs a saved search named Splunk Version Control Audit Query POST
- To prevent issues just before running the above query there is a sleep period involved (configurable via the splunk_vc_timeout macro)
- If the report confirms the relevant user did indeed request a restore of some kind, the restore continues
- The restore now followed the previous process from this point triggering a restore process
- If multiple users attempt to run the restore at the same time, one of them will receive an error to advise a restore is in progress and to try again later
Security Concerns
The ability to restore/create configuration opens up a few obvious issues:
- What if the lookup file storing the list of objects to restore and the user who is performing the restoration is manually edited to add additional rows?
- What if a user attempts to restore the objects of another user?
- What if a user attempts to restore an object but re-own it to a different user?
To address these issues, a report named ""SplunkVersionControl Audit Query"" runs a query against the audit logs to determine if the lookup was updated by the saved search ""SplunkVersionControl AddToLookup"". This audit query returns a username and a time (it looks back/forwards one second from when the lookup was created).
The restoration script then validates that the username entered in the lookup file and the time match those found in the audit log. If they do not match then the restoration is rejected.
If you are using the dynamic version of the restore dashboard (custom command postversioncontrolrestore, an alternative report named ""Splunk Version Control Audit Query POST"" runs to check the audit logs, this report determines if the restoration request was made by the user in question. The report returns 0 or more results and if it returns results for the particular user, the restore proceeds.
Due to the above there is the possiblity that multiple users may trigger a restore while a restore is in progress, a kvstore is used to prevent this from occurring and an additional restore attempt when the restore process is in progress results in an error message to try again.
If a user attempts to restore the objects of another user, or attempts to restore the objects as a different user, this is allowed if the user has the admin role (which is determined by the saved search ""SplunkVersionControl CheckAdmin"").
Why use a lookup file and not trigger a remote command execution?
A custom command named postversioncontrolrestore and the accompanying dashboard splunkversioncontrolrestore_dynamic were created for this purpose in version 1.0.7
However this version wil not work in Splunk Cloud as it would require connectivity to an on-prem instance that can perform the backup/restore modular input functions
What is required for this application to work with a remote git repository?
The following assumptions are made:
- git is accessible on the command line, this has been tested on Linux & Windows with git for Windows installed
- git is using an SSH-based URL and the remote git repository allows the machine running the SplunkVersionControl application to remotely access the repository without a username/password prompt (i.e. SSH keys are in use)
- git will work from the user running the Splunk process over SSH, note that on Windows this will be the system account by default, on Linux the splunk user
- the git repository is dedicated to this particular backup as the root / top level of the git repo will be used to create backups 
Do the modular input backup and restore tasks need to be on the same Splunk instance?
No. However, the backup/restore modular input must have access to its own git temporary directory on the OS filesystem, the temporary directory should be unique for both backup and restore operations
When will a full application backup occur?
During the first run of the script (at which point the lookup file is empty) all applications and all objects will be backed up.
During each subsequent run of the script, if an application is found in the Splunk system but not on the filesystem then the backup of all objects within that application will occur
Otherwise an incremental backup of knowledge objects occurs (see below)
What gets backed up on each modular input run (incremental runs)?
There are two searches used to determine ""what"" has changed since the last run of the modular input:
- SplunkVersionControl ChangeDetector Non-Directory
- SplunkVersionControl ChangeDetector Directory
These two searches are passed in an epoch value, they then return a list of applications and the type of config that has changed.
For example if application search has had macros changed, then all macros in the search app will be backed up, however the savedsearches/dashboards/et cetera will not be backed up unless at least one of them in that app has changed.
How does the version control work?
Each backup run that results in more than 0 file changes will auto-commit all changes into git and tag with the current date/time including the minute of the hour. This will create tags such as 2019-01-10_0136, these tags can later be used to ""restore from"" in the ""SplunkVersionControl Restore"" dashboard.
The tags are recorded by outputting the tag list into the lookup definition splunkversioncontrol_taglist within the app, this same lookup definition is read by the dashboard to list available tags to restore from.
How will the restore work?
The restoration is based on a git tag, the relevant tag is checked out on the filesystem after running a git checkout master; git pull command.
Once checked out, the app/user/global directories are checked (depending on which scope was requested) to see if there is a relevant config item to restore, if found the remote object is either updated with the contents of git or created if it does not exist. By default the knowledge object is created with the same username that was in the backup, however there is an option on the SplunkVersionControl Restore dashboard to override the user on restoration, this is only able to be done by a user with an admin role.
What other lookup files are used by the app?

splunkversioncontrol_globalexclusionlist, this lookup definition records a list of excluded applications
splunkversioncontrol_restorelist, this lookup definition records what must be restored by the restore modular input (this is used by the non-dynamic dashboard)
splunkversioncontrol_taglist, this lookup definition records the tags available in git

Where are the logs?
On a Linux-based system
- /opt/splunk/var/log/splunk/splunkversioncontrol_restore.log -- this log will contain information about the splunk restore modular input
- /opt/splunk/var/log/splunk/splunkversioncontrol_backup.log -- this log will contain information about the splunk backup modular input
- /opt/splunk/var/log/splunk/splunkversioncontrol_postversioncontrolrestore.log -- this log contains information about the | postversioncontrol command
- /opt/splunk/var/log/splunk/splunkversioncontrol_rest_restore.log -- log log contains information about hits to the REST endpoint /services/splunkversioncontrol_rest_restore
Or the internal index which also has these log files with the sourcetype splunkversioncontrol
Installation guide
Standalone instance

Install this application on the Splunk standalone instance, if you are going to access a remote instance please ensure you can access the remote instance on port 8089
Create a new git repo and initialise the repo (it can have a README or can it be empty, but it must be at a point where the master branch exists)
The server doing the git backup must have SSH access to the repo without a username/password (in other words you need to have the SSH key setup so a git clone/git checkout/git push) all work without a prompt for credentials as the OS user running Splunk (as the modular input will run as this user)
If running on a standalone server the modular inputs can be configured either on the current standalone server, or another remote server, the app will work either way
If errors are seen when creating the modular inputs see the troubleshooting below, or raise a question on SplunkAnswers for assistance
If you are running the newer splunkversioncontrol_restore_dynamic dashboard the macros splunk_vc_name, splunk_vc_url, splunk_vc_timeout may need customisation to match your environment. In particular the splunk_vc_name assumes you have called your SplunkVersionControlRestore modular input ""Prod"". See the macros section of this document for more information
Ensure the directory where the git repository will be cloned to is empty (i.e. the git clone can create it)
Ensure the git repository has at least 1 commit (i.e. it is initialized and a git checkout master will work if you clone the git repo)
Ensure the git repository is not shared with anything other than this particular backup, as other items may be overwritten 
When you create the Splunk Version Control Backup (via Settings -> Data Inputs -> Splunk Version Control Backup), click ""More settings"" and set the backup interval you would like (tags will only be created if config has changed within Splunk)
When you create the Splunk Version Control Restore (via Settings -> Data Inputs -> Splunk Version Control Restore), if you are using the newer splunkversioncontrol_restore_dynamic dashboard then you do not need to set a run interval, if you are using the older method you want to run this on an interval to check if the lookup file has been updated and if a restore is required...

Search head cluster (on prem)

Install the SplunkVersionControl application on the SHC via the deployer as normal but do not configure the modular inputs on the search head cluster
Run the modular inputs on a standalone instance using the above instructions, and set the srcURL and destURL to a search head cluster member (or a load balanced REST port of the SHC)

Splunk Cloud

Install this application as per the standalone instance documentation above onto a non-SplunkCloud instance, install the VersionControl For SplunkCloud on the SplunkCloud instance
Note that in SplunkCloud the only option is the splunkversioncontrol_restore dashboard, the dynamic dashboard cannot be used in SplunkCloud
Configure the remoteAppName within the Splunk Version Control Backup & Splunk Version Control Restore modular inputs to ""SplunkVersionControlCloud""

How do I initialize a git repository?
github and other websites may offer to initialize the repository for you, if they do not the steps are usually similar to:
- git clone git@<website>:testing.git
- cd testing
- touch README.md
- git add README.md
- git commit -m ""add README""
- git push -u origin master
There are also many online resources to help with learning git
What do the parameters do?
Please refer to github or the README.md for the details
Additional notes
To get passwords into or out of the passwords.conf you may wish to use https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4013/
The context of the application name (default of SplunkVersionControl) will be checked first for the password, if that fails a query to all contexts /-/-/ will occur, realms will be ignored, only the name of the password is used for searching so any realm (or lack of realm) will work for storing the password
Macros
The following macros exist and are relate to the splunkversioncontrol_restore_dynamic dashboard
- splunk_vc_name - this macro is the name of the splunkversioncontrol_restore modular input name on the remote (or local) system where the restore occurs
- splunk_vc_url - this macro is the URL endpoint of the remote system, defaults to https://localhost:8089/services/splunkversioncontrol_rest_restore, you will need to change this if you have a remote instance performing the backup/restore operations, for example if you are on a search head cluster
- splunk_vc_timeout - this is the time delay between triggering the remote command and waiting for the _audit index to catchup with a log entry to advise the command was run, if set too short the restore may fail because the | postversioncontrolrestore search has not appeared in the _audit index yet
- sslVerify - defaults to ""False"", this can be set to the location of a CA file to be used by the python requests library to validate the SSL certificates in use
- requestingAddress - by default the REST endpoint splunkversioncontrol_rest_restore will make a HTTPS call back to the calling IP address, this overrides the address to call back, the default of False results in a call back to the requesting IP address which is used in most use cases 
- splunk_vc_ko_query, should be configured to point to an appname:searchname, the default is splunk_kom:splunk_vc_kom_audit_summary
Troubleshooting
In some Linux OS distributions an error similar to OPENSSL_1.0.0 not found may appear, os.unsetenv('LD_LIBRARY_PATH') appears to fix this however AppInspect does not allow modification of OS environment variables.
If you have this issue please add this into the python files to workaround the problem as required
Refer to this issue on github for more details
Note that you can run this from the command line if the logs are not getting populated:
splunk cmd splunkd print-modinput-config splunkversioncontrol_backup splunkversioncontrol_backup://<your_input_name_goes_here>
Finally the log files are mentioned under the ""Where are the logs?"" section of this document
Configuring the macro & savedsearch to work with the run_ko_query option
Please refer to the full README.md or github for all the details
Problems with the Splunk Version Control Restore or Splunk Version Control Backup modular input
Both inputs follow a similar validation process:
- Run a request against <srcURL>/servicesNS/nobody/<remoteAppName>/search/jobs/export?search=makeresults (where remoteAppName is SplunkVersionControl unless specified)
- Run the OS command (as the user running splunk) git ls-remote <gitRepoURL>
- If the above fails attempt to run ssh -n -o \""BatchMode yes\"" -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no <gitRepoURL>
- If the previous step was required re-attempt the git ls-remote step again
In 7.3.0 the Splunk process will kill -9 the modular input if it takes more than 30 seconds, if this occurs you can bypass validation by updating the inputs.conf file manually
Will this work on a search head cluster?
Yes but do not configure the modular inputs to run on the search head cluster, modular inputs run on each member at the same time which would not work well. What you want to do is configure a standalone server with the modular inputs for backup/restore and set the srcURL/destURL to the remote search head cluster member (or load balanced URL) on the REST port.
This would allow the modular inputs to run backup/restore and any customers to use the dashboard on the search head cluster member to request restoration of a knowledge object
Can I use this application on Windows?
Yes, please refer to the full README.md or github for all the details
Can I use this on a Splunk Cloud instance?
This application, no. But this application can be used to backup a SplunkCloud instance from a remote Splunk instance, the same remote instance could also be used to restore to the SplunkCloud instance.
To do this you will need to install Version Control For SplunkCloud on your SplunkCloud instance, and setup this application on a remote instance configuring an interval for both the Splunk Version Control Backup and Splunk Version Control Restore modular inputs

Overview
Many organizations is IDS/IPS devices and software as their first line of defense against attackers. This app provides Splunk dashboards, forms, and reports which can be used to explore your IDS events across your different sourcetypes.
To do this, the app relies on the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) for IDS attack events. This means that the app can report on any intrusion data, as long as it has been on-boarded properly, and is available through the Intrusion Detection data model, including network, host, wireless, and application products.
A note on Splunk Data Model Acceleration and Disk Space
This app requires data model acceleration, which will use additional disk space. If you are using the Splunk App for Enterprise Security, this is already enabled, and should have been factored into your retention policies. If not, you should review the documentation on data model acceleration, how it uses disk space, and how to plan for it.
A note on the Splunk Common Information Model
As mentioned above, the app uses the CIM for intrusion events. The CIM allows you to take events from a number of sources or products, and report on them in one cohesive manner, using a common set of names for fields and event types.
Available Dashboards
Overview
Provides a starting point for exploring your IDS events. Most panels will drill-down to other pages in the application.
Attack Source Profile
A view based on the source of IDS events.
Attack Destination Profile
IDS events where attacks are launched against the same destination.
Attack Signature Profile
Panels which focus on events which all are from the same identified with the same signature.
Attack Category Profile
A view focusing on attacks which fall into the same category (as defined in the events).
Attack Search
A form for finding events based on various field values.
Sourcetypes (Advanced)
Information about the sourcetypes which are present in the accelerated data.
Prerequisites
Splunk Versions
This app has been tested with Splunk versions 7.0 and 7.1. This app should be installed on the same search head on which the |data_model| data model has been accelerated.
Splunk Common Information Model Add-on
This app depends on data models included in the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on, specifically the |data_model| data model. Please review the information on installing and using the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on and information on configuring the acceleration on the data model.
The Splunk Common Information Model Add-on can be downloaded from Splunkbase.
This app has been tested with versions 4.9 of the CIM add-on.
Data model Acceleration on the Intrusion data model
In order to make the app respond and load quickly, accelerated data models are used to provide summary data. For this data to be available, the |data_model| data model must be accelerated. Information on how to enable acceleration for the |data_model| data model can be found here. The data model must be accelerated for the length of time for which you would like to see reporting.
Installation
This app should be installed on a search head where the |data_model| data model has been accelerated. More information on installing or upgrading Splunk apps can be found here.
Simple Installation Process

Make sure the field extractions and tags on your intrusion events are correct.
Install the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on (skip if you are installing on an ES search head).
Install the Aplura Intrusion App for Splunk for Splunk.
Enable accelerations on the |data_model| data model (skip if you are installing on an ES search head).
Wait for the accelerations to start. After the acceleration searches have run, you should start seeing the dashboards populate.

Overview


The UMFA App for Splunk is a forwarder monitoring app bringing together and enhancing multiple 
disjointed monitoring functions already in use in Splunk. This monitoring tool will provide details on 
any system that has sent an event to your indexer(s) including reporting on full instances of Splunk, 
Universal Forwarders, Heavy Forwarders, and even independent Stream forwarders. It also brings deployment
server information to your forwarder monitoring. At the click of a button see volume and connection stats,
find out exactly which apps and server classes are deployed to a forwarder, or see if there are inactive 
apps or server classes that may be cleaned from a deployment server. This app aims to be a one stop shop
for your forwarder monitoring needs.
Support
Questions or feature requests may be sent to Madison.Moss@jhuapl.edu and support may depend on availability. 
Support is to only include bug fixes in the case any feature or process does not work as described within
documentation. In this case I will work to resolve the issue and update the app with the fix in place. Feature 
requests may be sent but are not guaranteed in any future releases of the app.
Installation
The UFMA App for Splunk is an app that provides searches and visualizations and should be installed on a 
search head. The app will work in a standalone, distributed, or clustered environment. On a standalone 
search head place the app in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ and refresh Splunk
(https://<your_searchHead>:8000/en-US/debug/refresh)  or install from file directly from the web GUI. In 
a clustered environement place the app in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/shcluster/apps/ on the Deployer and apply 
the cluster bundle to the search head cluster (splunk apply shcluster-bundle -target <shcluster-captain>:8089).
After installation it is recommended to manually run ""Rebuild Asset Table"" under All Configurations to get
an initial table of forwarders.
Requirements
Users of UFMA must have permissions to view _internal index and access to REST capabilities. The recommended
role is ""admin"". In order to enrich your data with deployment server information your deployment server(s)
must be added as search peers on the search head where UFMA will be run. This is not required for forwarder
alerting but for functionality is recommended. Follow Splunk recommended requirements for OS and hardware
guidelines.
App Components


Many components in the app have customized drilldowns for filtering and to provide quicker deep dives.
Forwarders - Forwarder Summary
The Forwarder Summary dashboard is a complete overview of everything forwarding in your environment. It
will provide everything from a total count of forwarders to event stats and sending volume for individual
forwarders for the time range selected. This view may help you identify your most active forwarders, if your 
forwarders are load balancing properly, or if a once active forwarder is not active at all.  It will also tell 
you exactly where your forwarders are checking into if you use multiple deployment servers. Please note any 
deployment server information will appear as ""N/A"" if a forwarder is not configured to use a deployment server 
or the deployment server it is checking into has not been added as a search peer. Other information may appear 
as ""N/A"" if no data has been received for the forwarder within the selected time range.
Forwarders - Forwarder Detail
The Forwarder Detail dashboard is a deep dive into a single forwarder in your environment. It will provide
forwarding statistics for a forwarder for the selected time range as well as provide deployment server details
as to exactly which apps and server classes are on the forwarder. Please note, if an app has been deployed
directly to the forwarder and not through a deployment server the app will not appear in this information. It
also provides and overview of which sourcetypes the forwarder has sent over the selected time range. New in 2.0.0
there is now a hidden panel that will appear if _introspection has been enabled for the selected forwarder. This
will provide a deep dive into how Splunk is utilizing system resources and allow you to optimize forwarder
performance. Look for things like if entire CPU cores are consumed by Splunk and see whether those resources are
going to scripted input, registry monitoring (baselining can be CPU intensive), or other Splunk actions. Details
on how to enable this additional monitoring are available on the Forwarder Resource Usage Dashboard.
Forwarders - Forwarder Resource Usage
The Forwarder Resource Usage dashboard adds even more granularity into monitoring your forwarders. It dives into
resource usage of different Splunk components and helps enable you to look for anomalous systems that Splunk
may be consuming more CPU or RAM on for whatever reason. Drill down into different systems and it will direct you
to the Forwarder Detail dashboard for more details on a specific system.
Deployment Server Summary
The Deployment Server Summary provides details on apps, server classes, and every forwarder checking into your
deployment server(s). See what apps or server classes are deployed and which ones are inactive and might be able
to be cleaned from the deployment server. Also quickly be able to tell which forwarder and app or server class 
is deployed to.
All Configurations - Rebuild Asset Table
Tired of having to completely rebuild your asset table in the Monitoring Console and losing missing forwarders
that may still be important? Now you have the option to selectively remove missing forwarders from your asset
table while retaining your alerting for other missing forwarders. Select the default ""All"" to completely rebuild
the table or use the multiselect to pick missing forwarders to remove from the current list. Please note if a
selected forwarder has recorded activity within that timerange selected it will still appear in the table. Also,
the total forwarder number on this page may differ from that on the Forwarders - Forwarder Summary page as this
page accounts for all GUIDs which may have duplicate hostnames. The Forwarders - Forwarder Summary page will dedup
over hostname only taking the latest/active GUID.
All Configurations - Reports
A collection of all saved reports for UFMA. By default there is a single scheduled search, ""UFMA - Complete Asset 
List"",set to run every 5 minutes to update the forwarder asset table. You may adjust these settings to your 
environment's needs. Larger environments may want to reduce the frequency in which the report runs.
All Configurations - Alerts
A collection of all alerts for UFMA. By default there is a single alert, ""UFMA - ALERT - Missing Forwarders"",
checking for any missing forwarder set to run every 5 minutes. The alert action is currently set to list in 
triggered alerts. You may update this to your needs such as email alerting. This alert corresponds with the 
scheduled report ""UFMA - Complete Asset List"". A forwarder is considered missing if it has not connected to an 
indexer in the last 15 minutes. Using this combination of search and alert you should know if a forwarder is 
offline in about 20 minutes or less from the time the forwarder stops connecting. You may adjust this time by 
changing the ""900"" seconds used in ""UFMA - Complete Asset List"" to alter the 15 minute missing classification and 
may change the run frequency of the scheduled search and alert to reduce or increase the additional up to 5 minutes 
of lag in reporting. Please do take into account the ""UFMA - Complete Asset List"" search can be an intensive search 
and may need to be adjusted to work well depending the size of your environment. You may customize your forwarder 
alerting further by filtering what you want to report on. Some examples below will help layout how to exclude 
specific forwarder hostnames or forwarders checking into specific deployment servers from alerting on missing
forwarders. You may disable the default alert and create your own or modify the existing alert to insert your
environment details.
Custom Alert - Exclude Deployment Server(s)
| inputlookup ufma_asset_list 
| search status=""missing"" deployment_server!=<deploymentServer> ... deployment_server!=<deploymentServerN>
| eval last_connected = strftime(last_connected, ""%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S %z"") 
| fields hostname forwarder_type version last_connected deployment_server
Custom Alert - Exclude Hostname(s)
| inputlookup ufma_asset_list
| search status=""missing"" hostname!=<hostname1> hostname!=<hostname2> ... hostname!=<hostnameN>
| eval last_connected = strftime(last_connected, ""%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S %z"")
| fields hostname forwarder_type version last_connected deployment_server
All Configurations - Dashboards
A collection of all views contained in UFMA
Search
A basic search function to use within the UFMA context
Macros
If you look at the macros contained within UFMA you will see a variety of macros used to drive the app. One macro
called ""exclude_hosts"" contains some dummy hosts by default but can be editted if you would like to exclude certain
hosts from being populated in your asset table. A use case for this may be where certain VMs are continuously spun
up and destroyed. Rather than having a quickly growing asset table that needs to be rebuilt to remove these system
they can be called out in this macro to exclude them from the start.",Version 2.0.3,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/639c61f4-372a-11ec-802c-6a80fa660673.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance, Utilities",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,"2,499",0,splunk,5,5,Madison Moss,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/mdsnmss,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

New in Version 0.2: 
port is now taken from the forwarderquery.conf, alternatively user port=""xyz"" to override
new parameter method, defaults to GET, can set it to method=""POST"" in order to perform stuff like a restart
updated dashboard now shows the deploy-poll server(s) 
pending: the xml output should be passed in _raw not xmlresults for ease of use.
New in Version 0.3: 
Add a file via oneshot
New in Version 0.4:
contains a new command to perform rest calls on a list of hosts. Also allows to post data and can also call a DELETE action for eliminating endpoint configs. New UI for checking the connection to forwarders via REST, check the deploy-poll settings and - whee! - a browser for the remote filesystem.

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5209,2022-01-09,08:19:37 AM,Time Macros,,"Nov. 2, 2021","Supported Macros
As of 1.1.0, these are included:

tm_relative_time(epoch, relative) wraps the relative_time() eval function to shift an epoch time by a relative time modifier.
tm_strptime(timestr, format) wraps the strptime() eval function to convert a formatted time string to an epoch.
tm_strftime(epoch, format) wraps the strftime() eval function to convert an epoch into a formatted time string.
tm_trp2epoch(trp) converts the output of a timerangepicker into an epoch.
tm_relative_trp(trp, relative) combines tm_trp2epoch() with tm_relative_time(), it converts a timerangepicker output into epoch and then shifts that by a relative time modifier. Combining two macro calls like you would combine function calls in eval is not a thing, that's why a whole new macro is needed.
tm_business_hour_delta(start, end, output, resolution) writes the seconds that passed between start and end in resolution minute steps into the output field, but stops the clock outside business hours.
tm_business_hour_filter defines what your business hours are, predefined as ""Mon-Fri, 08:30 inclusive to 18:00 exclusive"". Override locally with an mvfilter() expression as needed for your business hours.

Known Issues

The macros use time() instead of now() for relative time calculations due to eval macro restrictions. In most scenarios relative time modifiers snapping to an hour, a day, etc. smooth over this difference. Keep it in mind if you manually override the value of now, such as when re-running old summary searches with fill_summary_index.py!
tm_business_hour_filter only works up to 10000 resolution-minute-steps, ie at the default 10-minute resolution it's good for 69 days (all hours, not just business hours). Consider 60-minute resolution if you need just over a year of working deltas, 1-minute-resolution if you need precision but don't care for deltas of a week or more. Excessively high resolution for long durations has a measurable command.eval impact if executed for many events.

Usage Examples:
Let's say your events contain an expiration_date field in epoch, and you want to find things that expired before August 1st 2020 in your user timezone:
index=foo sourcetype=bar expiration_date < `tm_strptime(""2020-08-01"", ""%F"")` | ...
This is converted to normalizedSearch/phase0 expiration_date<1596232800.000000 (see Job Inspector), and will use a lispy-based filter powered off tsidx files if expiration_date is declared as an indexed field for massive speed benefits.
If you used subsearches to do this calculation in the past, Time Macros is for you! Example by @jeffland:
Old style: index=foo some_epoch_field >= [| makeresults | eval search = relative_time(now(), ""-1h@h"")]
Time Macro style: index=foo some_epoch_field >= `tm_trp2epoch(""-1h@h"")`
Instead of launching a whole new search process to do one simple calculation, the eval-based macro will do the calculation during search expansion for virtually no added execution time.
Want to compare two time ranges in a dashboard without two timerange pickers?
Put one timerange picker time into the dashboard alongside a dropdown shift of ""sane"" comparison times such as -w, -2w, -d, -y, -mon, etc. and use tm_relative_trp(""$time.earliest$"", ""$shift$"") macro to compute the shifted earliest time for the comparison search.
Need to calculate the time it took to close a ticket, but only count time that passed during business hours? No Problem: index=tickets | `tm_business_hour_delta(start_time, end_time, output_field)` | ...",Version 1.1.1,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/2b4dc288-3c0d-11ec-9648-9a0a62e5edc2.png,Utilities,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/,219,0,splunk,5,2,Martin Müller,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/martin_mueller,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

You can control which issues to index by specifying a JQL query string.
Example:
project = SD AND updated > -15m

this JQL query string matches all issues in the service desk (SD) project that have been updated during the last 15 minutes

Why you should not use Jira Issues Collector Add-on
The Add-on Jira Issues Collector does not support API pagination. That means if your JQL query string returns more than the maximum allowable value defined by the Jira property jira.search.views.default.max, which defaults to 100, you will loose data.
This TA supports API pagination and adds some additional functionalities!
Configuration

Setup the Jira Account by going to the configuration page of the TA-jira_issue_input app: Configuration -> Account

Rewrite of Gemini KV Store Tools
Utilities for the Splunk App Key-Value Store
The KV Store Tools for Splunk app includes the following features:
Generating Commands

KV Store Backup: Backup KV Store collections to the file system on the search head.  
KV Store Restore: Restore KV Store collections from backup jobs[1].  Lists all existing backups in the default path if no arguments are given.
KV Store Push: Copy KV Store collections from the local Splunk search head to a remote instance or comma-separated instance list (SH/SHC)[1].  
KV Store Pull: Copy KV Store collections from a remote Splunk search head (SH/SHC) to the local instance[1].  
Delete Key: Delete KV Store records from a collection based on user input.  

Streaming Commands

Create Foreign Key: Creates an entry in a lookup and appends the resulting _key value to the current search results.  Useful for writing linked entries in two lookups.  
Delete Keys: Delete KV Store records from a collection based on _key values in search results.  

Alert Actions

Send to Collection: Similar to outputlookup, but can be toggled on/off by users that have permissions to edit search jobs without modifying the search. This functionality has been implemented by Splunk directly into the product since this was written.  

[1]: Deletes the collections from the target host before writing (unless otherwise specified).  

Command Usage
KV Store Backup
This functionality is implemented through a generating search command.  Syntax:  
| kvstorebackup app=""app_name"" collection=""collection_name"" path=""/data/backup/kvstore"" global_scope=""false""

The backup process will write one or more .json or .json.gz files (one for each collection).
Arguments:

(Optional) app: <string> - Set the app in which to look for the collection(s).  (Default: All)
(Optional) path: <string> - Set the directory path for the output files. (Default: the the setting in the app Setup page)
(Optional) global_scope: [true|false] - Specify the whether or not to include all globally available collections. (Default: false)
(Optional) collection: <string> - Specify the collection to backup. (Default: All)
(Optional) compression: [true|false] - Specify whether or not to compress the backups. (Default: false)

Best Practice: In a Search Head Cluster (SHC) environment, map a shared network drive to all members so that the backed-up collections are available to all of them.
KV Store Restore
This functionality is implemented through a generating search command.  Syntax:  
| kvstorerestore filename=""/backup/kvstore/app_name#collection_name#20170130*""

The restore process will delete the KV Store collection and overwrite it with the contents of the backup.
Arguments:

(Optional) filename: <string> - Specify the file to restore the data from.
(Optional) append: [true|false] - Specify whether or not to append records to the target KV Store collections. (Default: false - deletes the collection prior to restoring)

Running the search command with no arguments will list existing backups in the default path.
KV Store Create Foreign Key
This functionality is implemented through a streaming search command.  Syntax (example):  
search <events> | kvstorecreatefk collection=""<collection1_name>"" outputkeyfield=""<key_field_name>"" | outputlookup append=t <collection2_name>

Arguments:

(Required) collection: <string> - Specify the collection to create the new record within.  
(Optional) app: <string> - Specify the app to find the collection(s) within. (Default: current app)  
(Optional) outputkeyfield: <string> - Specify the output field to write the new key value to. (Default: _key)  
(Optional) staticvalues: <kvpairs> - Specify the static fields/values to write to the collection record.  (Default: None)  
(Optional) dynamicvalues: <kvpairs> - Specify the dynamic fields/values to write to the collection record (e.g. lookup_fieldname=event_field). Uses the first non-null field value in the search results.  (Default: None)  
(Optional) append: [true|false] - Specify whether or not to append records to the target KV Store collections. (Default: false - deletes the collection prior to migrating)  

KV Store Push
This functionality is implemented through a generating search command.  Configure your remote Splunk credentials in the Setup page.  Syntax:  
| kvstorepush app=""<app_name>"" collection=""<collection_name>"" global_scope=""[true|false]"" append=""[true|false]"" target=""<remote_host>""

The replication process will delete the remote KV Store collection and overwrite it with the contents of the backup, unless append=true is set.
Arguments:

(Required) target: <string> - Specify the hostname to upload collections to.
(Optional) port: <integer> - Specify the target splunkd port on the remote host. (Default: 8089)
(Optional) app: <string> - Specify the app to find the collection(s) within. (Default: All)
(Optional) global_scope: [true|false] - Specify the whether or not to include all globally available collections. (Default: false)
(Optional) collection: <string> - Specify the collection to migrate. (Default: All)
(Optional) append: [true|false] - Specify whether or not to append records to the target KV Store collections. (Default: false - deletes the collection prior to migrating)

KV Store Pull
This functionality is implemented through a generating search command.  Requires setup of your remote Splunk credentials in the Setup page.  Syntax:  
| kvstorepull app=""<app_name>"" collection=""<collection_name>"" global_scope=""[true|false]"" append=""[true|false]"" target=""<remote_host>""

The replication process will delete the local KV Store collection and overwrite it with the contents of the backup, unless append=true is set.
Arguments:

(Required) target: <string> - Specify the hostname to download collections from.
(Optional) port: <integer> - Specify the target splunkd port on the remote host. (Default: 8089)
(Optional) app: <string> - Specify the app to find the collection(s) within. (Default: All)
(Optional) global_scope: [true|false] - Specify the whether or not to include all globally available collections. (Default: false)
(Optional) collection: <string> - Specify the collection to migrate. (Default: All)
(Optional) append: [true|false] - Specify whether or not to append records to the target KV Store collections. (Default: false - deletes the collection prior to migrating)

KV Store Delete Keys
This functionality is implemented through a streaming search command.  Syntax (example):  
| inputlookup lookup_name where domain=""*splunk.com"" | deletekeys collection=""collection_name""

Deletes records from a KV Store collection based on _key value in search results
Arguments:

(Optional) app: <string> - Specify the app to find the collection within. (Default: All)
(Required) collection: <string> - Specify the collection to delete the data from.

KV Store Delete Key
This functionality is implemented through a generating search command.  Syntax:

THE INDUSTRIAL DEFENDER DIFFERENCE
Since 2006, Industrial Defender has been solving the challenge of safely collecting, monitoring, and managing OT asset data at scale, while providing cross-functional teams with a unified view of security.
Key Benefits
• Visualize control system assets and network communications with our asset topology map
• Drill down into individual asset health to monitor trends, manage events and investigate anomalies
• Quantify risk for individual assets with The Endpoint Risk Analytics Suite, which offers a transparent
scoring methodology and scores for four different threat vectors
• Automate asset configuration collection and on-demand vulnerability management
• Monitor systems performance, including application and process failures, registry and file changes
• Detect security events across your asset base and at your perimeter to take decisive action when
vulnerabilities and threats are identified
• Ease user, patching and policy management
• Reduce total cost of ownership (TCO) with multiple applications on a single platform
• Improve accuracy and efficiency of compliance reporting with automated data collection and archival
of artifacts relevant to regulatory requirements
• Leverage ready-to-go NERC CIP, NIST and NEI 08-09 policy libraries along with the Work
Automation Suite to automate the collection, storage and reporting of compliance artifacts for audit
requirements.

Unzip the file and copy the contents to your Splunk Server in /opt/splunk/etc/apps directory.  The final directory should look like /opt/splunk/etc/apps/veeam_backup_monitor
Restart Splunk.
Install Instructions for the Veeam Backup Monitor TA
Copy the TA from the /opt/splunk/etc/apps/appserver/addons and place it on your forwarder where your Veeam VBR is installed.
Run the VeeamTask.exe file locaed in the bin directory, this will prompt you for a username and password.  Enter in a username and password that is allowed to connect to the Veeam server and execute powershell scripts.  This application will create a scheduled task that runs as this user.  This app also creates a folder called ‘working’ that is in the bin directory of the app.
If you use a deployment server for the veeam_monitor_TA make sure you place this line in your serverclass.conf file under the class:app:veeam_monitor_TA to prevent the working directory from being wiped out.

Description
Welcome to the Splunk App ""Kaggle Content for Splunk"".
Using the 'kaggle' command, you can easily interact with the Kaggle API and use most of the available endpoints - with almost the same syntax than with the Kaggle CLI.
To interact with the API, you need to authenticate.
Once you got your token, copy 'username' and 'key', add/save it on the ""Setup Kaggle API Auth"" page and you are good to go!
Setup
Prerequisites
You'll need a valid Kaggle API token (username/key pair). Please refer to this page on how to get your personal API token.
Installation
This app should be installed on your Search Head using one of the standard installation procedures:

For non-Splunk Cloud deployments, refer to the standard methods for Splunk Add-on installs as documented for a Single Server Install or a Distributed Environment Install.

Available Commands
The available commands are derived from the Kaggle API itself, even though not all are (currently) implemented. Within the App, you'll find a comprehensive list of available commands with further information in the ""Documentation"" dashboard. In addition, please refer to the dashboard ""Examples"" and check out some live SPL searches to see the power of 'kaggle' search command in action.
Quick list of commands:
competitions
usage:
| kaggle competitions {list,files,download,leaderboard}

example:
| kaggle competitions list sort_by=prize page=1

datasets
usage:
| kaggle datasets {list,files,download,metadata}

example:
| kaggle datasets download heptapod/titanic file=train_and_test2.csv

example cont.:
| inputlookup train_and_test2.csv

kernels
usage:
| kaggle kernels {list,pull,output,status}

example:
| kaggle kernels list search=titanic

TA supports oAuth2 for authentication
TA creates unique checkpoint to each input created. 
TA makes each call to collect only 10 minutes of events to reduce the response size.
example: If input is configured to collect events for last 7 days, then TA will make total 1008 API calls. (6 calls per hour, 6*24 calls per day, 6*24*7 calls for 7 days.)

Prerequisites
follow the link below to know how to get Client ID, Client Secret, Workspace ID.
https://dev.loganalytics.io/oms/documentation/1-Tutorials/1-Direct-API
TA requires forllowing attributes

Name - Name of the Input
Interval - How frequently events need to be collected from log analytics
Index - Name of the index in which logs get stored
Tenant ID - Azure Tenant ID
Client ID - Application ID which has been granted access to log analytics workspace
Client Secret - Application secret key of Client/Application ID
Workspace ID - workspace in which Query/Table name avaialable
Query/Table Name - Table from which events need to be fetched.
Collect Events From - Time from when events need to be collected. It's optional and if no value given then default to last 7 days.
Event Delay - Agent installed on azure devices will take sometime to forward events to log analytics workspace. so it's very rare that events are available in log analytics realtime. This is to specify expected delay in minutes.
Source Type - to set custom source type for each input.

Troubleshooting
set logging to DEBUG mode and use below search to troubleshoot the TA.

There are two ways to install the dashboard - via the Splunk app listing, or manually with a provided dashboard 
package. To install the dashboard via the app listing, follow these steps:

From the Apps menu in Splunk, select Manage Apps
Select Browse More Apps
Do a search for the ""Rapid7 InsightVM Dashboard""

This dashboard must be used alongside the Rapid7 InsightVM Technology Add-On. The add-on serves as the method for 
retrieving asset and vulnerability data, which is then visualized with this dashboard. There are three sourcetypes to 
keep in mind when searching or creating visualizations of this data:

rapid7:insightvm:asset
rapid7:insightvm:asset:vulnerability_finding
rapid7:insightvm:vulnerability_definition

InsightVM Asset Dashboard
There are a few different components in the Asset Dashboard that display or visualize the imported InsightVM asset 
data. It's important to ensure that the correct index is selected here, as otherwise you may not see any data. The 
default index for the Dashboard follows that of the Technology Add-On and will be set to rapid7, but you can update 
this if a different one was chosen for data import.
Additional filtering can be done with the Tags dropdown, which uses tags - aggregates of site, asset groups, and 
asset tags - retrieved from InsightVM, and the Time Period dropdown, which allows you to select a date range for 
your data.

Users can configure this source type to collect events to Splunk®.and populate a custom dashboard visualizing different types and details for these events.
Using IdentityNow's AuditEvents API, we can solve a number of problems with this add-on. Some examples include:

Surface and gain insights into the brute force password attempts IdentityNow has blocked
Correlate IdentityNow user activity with other system events to identify coordinated attacks
Evaluate the timing of login attempts from different geographies to identify problems

Requirements
Full functionality requires the following:

In order to stream AuditEvent data to a Splunk Enterprise, or Splunk Cloud deployment, an active IdentityNow tenant must exist.
Configuration requires that the implementer also have the organization name of their IdentityNow API gateway.
Splunk® Enterprise Security (7.3.0+)

The Splunk App for Quorum contains a set of dashboards and analytics to give you full visibility into the system metrics, application data and ledger so that you can maintain security, stability and performance for your Quorum deployment.  
These dashboards are meant to be a starting point for building analytics around your Quorum blockchain no matter where it is deployed.
In order to take full advantage of the dashboards provided there are 3 types of data sources that should be configured. Not all of these data sources are required to use the app, this is just a small taste of what is possible with Splunk and blockchain!

Quorum Blocks, Transactions, and Events - These logs contain transaction information from the ledger itself and provide insight into operations and actions on-chain. We’ve open sourced Splunk Connect for Ethereum to help you easily ingest Quorum ledgers in Splunk.
Quorum node logs and metrics - These are logs and metrics specific to a Quorum node. Specifically, Quorum application logs, Geth metrics, RPC data polled from different Quorum node endpoints (i.e. admin_peers, txpool_content, etc -- see Splunk Connect for Ethereum for more information).
Infrastructure/System Level Metrics and Logs - System metrics such as CPU,MEM,DISK and NETWORK activity provide insight into the underlying infrastructure Quorum nodes are running on.  These metrics/logs could come from physical machines, Docker, Kubernetes, IBM IKS, Microsoft Azure, Google’s GCP and AWS Cloudwatch to name a few.  Splunk has different Add-ons and connectors for each.  

App Features
Dashboards
There are a few dashboards provided to get you started with analyzing your Quorum deployment. These include:
  * Data Setup - A dashboard to show you what data is being received by Splunk.
  * Raw Data Flow - A dashboard showing the data flowing in from each Quorum node and data source.
  * Infrastructure Health and Monitoring - An overview of system health from system metrics like CPU, uptime status as well as transaction latency. You can see in real time when transactions are starting to back up or a node is falling behind on blocks.
  * Transaction Analytics - Real time visibility into the transactions being written on the ledger. See a breakdown of private vs public transactions and analytics around addresses.
  * Ledger Query - Query the ledger using specific attributes to get detailed event data.
Getting Started


Automated Demo

The easiest way to test and demo the app is using the docker-compose Quorum example included with Splunk Connect for Ethereum.



Manual Setup

Install the App on a Splunk Enterprise Search Head that will have access to the data.  
Open the App and navigate to the “Data Setup” dashboard from the Introduction Page.
Follow the instructions for each of the 3 data sources on the “Data Setup” page in order to populate the graphs and validate data is coming in correctly. 



Quorum Block and Transaction Data - Splunk Connect for Ethereum is an open source agent that connects to each node on the Quorum network. See its README for deployment instructions. Docker, Kubernetes, and native deployments are all options.


Quorum node logs and metrics - You will need to create event and metric indexes in Splunk as well as an input mechanism to receive the data.  We usually like to create an index called “ethereum” and “metrics” and enable the Splunk HEC to receive data.  You can use the example “indexes.conf.example” provided in the app.  Simply rename the file from “indexes.conf.example” to “indexes.conf” to enable the indexes, and rename “inputs.conf.example” to “inputs.conf” to enable the HEC endpoints. You will also need to enable the HTTP Event Collector (HEC) to receive data if it has not been ""enabled"" already.  




$ cd $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/splunk-app-quorum/default
$ sudo mv inputs.conf.example inputs.conf
$ sudo mv indexes.conf.example indexes.conf
$ cd /opt/splunk/bin
$ sudo ./splunk restart


Quorum node JSON-RPC data - Quorum nodes also have RPC endpoints that Splunk Connect for Ethereum can poll and send to Splunk. This can be used to monitor transaction pool activity on a node, active peers, or leader election in Raft or Istanbul. In order for this to work, the required endpoints need to be whitelisted on the Quorum node. See the README at Splunk Connect for Ethereum for more information.


System Logs/Metrics - Depending on how you’ve deployed your Quorum network, there is probably a great option to get your System Logs and Metrics for end-to-end visibility. On the data setup dashboard, we’ve provided a list of common options that you can use to get your data into Splunk.

Splunk gives security, IT operations and application delivery teams powerful insights and valuable operational intelligence across your entire organization. Its powerful search, visualization and alerting capabilities enable them to understand current operations more effectively than ever before, and configure simple alert actions to respond to certain issues automatically.
But when difficult operations issues arise, splunk’s simple script and web-hook alert actions may not be enough.  And waiting for human-scale response times to incipient cyber activity or complex IT system failures means greater impact to operations.
With >rapid response, your operations teams can easily capture their deep expertise into powerful custom alert actions that execute within milliseconds.  >rapid response alert actions enable your operations teams to systematically orchestrate and track response actions at all layers of the stack across the entire enterprise in real-time, all the while maintaining secure positive control over all automated actions.
But where>rapid response really shines is in its ability to automate sophisticated  dynamic response strategies – strategies that dynamically interact with splunk’s powerful search and analysis capabilities to drill down on an issue, determine root cause, and orchestrate the most effective response actions for the situation.
GET >RAPID RESPONSE

rapid response consists of two parts:

1.  rapid response app  – installs on the Splunk server
2.  rapid response service (AppSymphony) – installs on its own host

You can download the >rapid response app from Splunkbase.

Who is this app for?
This app is for anyone who wants to display several metrics on a small area of a dashboard.
How does the app work?
This app provides a visualization that you can use in your own apps and dashboards.
To use it in your dashboards, simply install the app, and create a search that provides the values you want to display.
Usecases for the Heat Map Visualization:

Displaying server metrics like CPU, Memory, I/O, and Disk usage over time
Comparing sales volume by category over time
Showing related application metrics in a discreet dashboard panel
Highlighting any metrics relative to other entities

The following fields can be used in the search:
 - _time (required): The easiest way to construct a search is to use the | timechart command, with a by clause.
 - category fields (required): Each field name will become a label on the side, with the values being used to set the color based on thresholds. The order of the fields determines the order shown in the viz.
Example Search
| gentimes start=-7 increment=4h 
| eval ""Server Availability""=random()%100, ""Customer Satisfaction""=random()%100,""Server Performance""=random()%100, _time=starttime
| table _time, ""Server Availability"",""Customer Satisfaction"",""Server Performance""
Tokens
Tokens are generated each time you click a cell. This can be useful if you want to populate another panel on the dashboard with a custom search, or link to a new dashboard with the tokens carrying across.

Value: This is the numeric field for the cell you clicked. Default value: $hm_token_value$
Label: This is the field name for the cell you clicked. Default value: $hm_token_label$
Time: This is the '_time' field for the selection. Default value: $hm_token_time$

Save to Desktop
If you click the hamburger menu at the top right, you can download a screenshot or CSV export to your desktop:

Rounded Squares with Values
In additon to squares you can choose round cells. You also have the option of including the value in the cell:

Using sample data
The app comes with sample data that can be found in the ""sampledata"" folder. If you want to try the app without configuring your Instagram developer account you can skip all steps except step 4 and manually upload the sample files. Make sure you import the files using sourcetype=instagram and index=instagram.
Using Instagram API
If you want to enable a real time feed from Instagram follow the steps below.
1.Create a developer account with Instagram.""
This can be done here:
https://instagram.com/developer
2.Register a client to obtain your Client ID and Client Secret.""
This can be done here:
https://instagram.com/developer/clients/register/
The Splunk app for Instagram uses implicit authentication so you have to un-check the checkbox ""Disable implicit Oauth"".
3.Obtain your access token.""
This entire process is described on this page:
https://instagram.com/developer/authentication/
As we are using implicit authentication you can skip to the section called ""Client-Side (implicit) authentication"" which is described below under 3.1 and 3.2.
3.1 Direct your user to our authorization URL""
https://instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=CLIENT-ID redirect_uri=REDIRECT-URI response_type=token
At this point, we present the user with a login screen and then a confirmation screen where they approve your app’s access to their Instagram data. Note that unlike the explicit flow the response type here is ""token"".
3.2 Receive the access_token via the URL fragment""
Once the user has authenticated and then authorized your application, we’ll redirect them to your redirect_uri with the access_token in the url fragment. 
It’ll look like so:
http://your-redirect-uri#access_token=ACCESS-TOKEN
Simply grab the access_token off the URL fragment.
4.Install the Splunk app for Instagram
5.Install the dependent REST API Modular Input app""
Copy the folder SPLUNK HOME/etc/apps/instagram/install/rest_ta to SPLUNK HOME/etc/apps/ . This will install the official REST API modular input created by Damien Dallimore that is used for connecting to the Instagram API. This version of rest_ta includes some custom python response handlers to handle the Instagram API json format. These are not included in the REST API Modular input app that can be found on Splunkbase. 
6.Add the Instagram API credentials to the app.""
Add Client ID, Client Secret, and Access Token to the REST inputs that can be found under Settings->Data Inputs->REST
The Splunk app for Instagram connects to the Instagram API. I have included connections to 5 endpoints although you can easily add more endpoint connections by creating a new REST input.
Full details on the endpoints can be found here:
https://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/
7.Enable the REST modular inputs""
This can be done under Settings->Data Inputs->REST
The app will place all data in the index called ""instagram""
8.Done!
Usage instructions
Data inputs
The app comes with five pre-configured data inputs.
Your complete feed
https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/self/feed
This will download every post that appear on the feed associated with the Access Token. This includes posts by other users that the user is following.
User feed - self
https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/self/media/recent
This will download all posts made by the user associated with the Access Token. The Instagram API will split up the feeds in small pieces of about 50-200 posts per call to limit the amount of data that is sent at any one time. The Splunk app for Instagram will traverse through all posts made by the user by doing multiple API calls. It will start with the newest posts first until it reaches the oldest post. After that the app will add a parameter to the API url string called min_timestamp which will tell the Instagram API to only return posts made after that timestamp.
User feed - nature
https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/2666166/media/recent
This will download all posts for the user id 2666166. The app includes this input as an example for the account ""nature"". To follow a different account, clone this input and/or modify the user id 2666166 in the endpoint URL to something else. You can find out the user id for an Instagram user by visiting various web pages such as these: 
http://jelled.com/instagram/lookup-user-id 
http://www.otzberg.net/iguserid/ 
This input will also traverse through all old posts in the same way as the ""User feed - self"" input.
Tag search - #nature
https://api.instagram.com/v1/tags/nature/media/recent
This will look for posts tagged with ""#nature"" . The Instagram user does not have to follow the users creating the posts so this can be used to find trends or to follow activity for your keyword or brand. To follow a different tag, clone this input and/or modify the word ""nature"" in the endpoint URL. Please note that links in the caption (@nature rather than #nature) are not captured by the Instagram API tag endpoint.
Followed by - nature
https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/2666166/followed-by
This will download the list of users that are following the user ""nature"". To follow a different account, clone this input and/or modify the user id 2666166 in the endpoint URL to something else.
Please note that there is no timestamp in the response for this endpoint so we cannot know when a user started following the ""nature"" account. The timestamp will be when you downloaded that particular follower. Some users on Instagram have many millions of followers so it can take a long time to get the full user list. I have achieved speeds of about 2000 followers per minute using this endpoint so to download a ""followed by"" list for an account with millions of followers could take days to complete.
Keep the naming convention, ""Followed by - USER"", on this data source as we extract the field Following from the source field. There is no other way to extract the user that the user is following as this is not contained in the response from the Instagram API.
Dashboards
The app comes with three dashboards.
User feed - self
This shows statistics and metrics around your feed
User feed - nature
This shows statistics and metrics around the template account (@nature) that the app is following.
Tag tracking
This shows trends around the tag #nature
There is also an additional report, ""REST API Tracking"", that shows you the amount of events that is coming into your Splunk installation. This can be used to see which feed or tag is generating most traffic.
Data model
The app comes with a data model called ""Social"" that you can use to do ad-hoc reporting through the pivot interface. You can access it by clicking ""Pivot"" in the navigation menu.",Version 1.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/f399a77a-c351-11e4-80e2-0ab36cafcece.png,"Business Analytics, Utilities",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,475,0,splunk,5,2,Johan Bjerke,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/jbjerke_splunk,"Products: Splunk Enterprise

A Splunk app that polls VMware(r) SD-WAN VCO event log for logging to Splunk. The VCO contains both SD-WAN Edge operational events such as Edge Up and Down, Link Down and Up, together with security activities such as users logging into the VCO and associated configuration changes.  
Although SD-WAN Edges can be configured to log to syslog, there are additional operational actviities that occur within the VCO which are of interest to IT Operations / Security Operations. 
I recommend a polling interval to VCO no less than 120 seconds and 300 seconds is what I regard as normal.

We use tools like Splunk on a daily basis to ensure the security of our most
important assets. From firewall logs, to proxy logs, Unix syslog to
Windows Event Logs, we're able to collect, filter, analyze, and report on all this
information within Splunk to provide a 360 degree view of our security posture.
However, all these things can be rendered meaningless if someone is able to walk into
a closet, an office, or a datacenter and walk out with an asset containing valuable 
information.
It is part of a security engineer's job to ensure that an in-depth security plan
is in place, and that includes logging, monitoring, and auditing of access to
physical assets and entry into restricted areas.
Splunk Perimeter Security is a monitoring package for Splunk with a focus on
logging, monitoring, and alerting on events generated from access to physical
locations using CIM-compliant Alert logs from a pre-existing or custom-made
alarm or security monitoring system. For certain applicaitons, if deployed properly,
it can greatly augment or replace a traditional physical alarm system.
The application includes several dashboards that enable monitoring and include auditing of
physical access events to a home, office, or a datacenter. 
Warning About Alarm Systems
Alarm systems come in many shapes and forms and can range from simple hard-wired home
systems to millitary grade security. If you are going to make modifications to your
alarm system, please proceed with caution and ensure you aren't disabling or interfering
with something that may sound a panic alarm, call the authorities, or trap you in a room
and proceed to fill it with nerve gas. Treat your alarm system as you would any 
mission-critical production system. 
RaspberryPi Proof of Concept
As a proof of concept, as well as a sample implementation for a home alarm system,
the app includes a TA-PerimeterSecurity package that can be deployed to a RaspberryPi that
is wired into a home security system through the onboard GPIO pins.
The http://raspberrypi.org is a small, low-power ARM computer that is ideal for
running small web servers, home automation, and general tinkering. When wired correctly,
it is possible to monitor the GPIO (General Purpose I/O) pins on the computer using a small
Python script. Using the Splunk Forwarder for Linux ARM,
you can monitor the output of the Python script and use it to build a set of dashboards, reports,
and alerts for your alarm system.
For more information about building an alarm system using a Raspberry Pi, see the documentation
for TA - Splunk Perimeter Security.
Included in the Raspberry Pi TA is a sample data file from Sunday, January 18th 2014.

an ""armed"" state. Included is a script that can be triggered via a real-time alert
to notify a list of contacts (populated via a lookup table) via text messaging using
the Twilio API.
The Twilio Python Helper Library library must be
installed for text message alerting to work. This is not required for the rest of the app to 
function, but you will be unable to send alerts using the provided script if it is not installed.
On your Splunk server, run:
sudo pip install twilio
This will install the necessary libraries onto your system Python installation. NOTE: Splunk's Python
installation is not sufficient for this script to work.
Within the Splunk $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/perimeter-security/bin/scripts/ directory are two files:
File            | Purpose 
--------------- | --------
send-text.sh    | Wrapper script to call send-text.py
send-text.py    | Handles sending of text messages via the Twilio API

You will need to modify send-text.py before you can call it within an alert. Open the file, and edit these lines:
# =Variable Definitions=
Twilio_From = ""[your Twilio phone number]""
Twilio_SID = ""[your Twilio SID]""
Twilio_Auth = ""[your Twilio Auth key - keep this secret!]""
# /=Variable Definitions=

Lastly, you will need to configure a lookup table to list out which phone numbers should be
notified when an alert is triggered.
Open $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/perimeter-security/lookups/alert_phones.csv and add phone numbers, one
per line. You must include your country code and area code.

Future Enhancements
Below are some ideas for enhancements to the application.

Allow enabling and disabling of the alarm via incoming text messages
Make use of Splunk's RBAC settings to only allow specific users to enable/disable the alarm system
Add the user's ID to the audit log of alarm enable/disable settings.
Heath checks on Raspberry Pi GPIO pin monitoring daemon.
Compliance with physical access logging and auditing standards defined by various governmental and standards organizations.

Additional help documentation is available at https://docs.rapid7.com/insightvm/insightvm-technology-add-on-for-splunk/
Installation
There are two ways to install the technology add-on - via the Splunk app listing, or manually with a provided 
technology add-on package. To install the add-on via the app listing, follow these steps:

From the Apps menu in Splunk, select Manage Apps
Select Browse More Apps
Do a search for the ""Rapid7 InsightVM Technology Add-On""
Select Install from the app listing
Perform a restart of Splunk when prompted

To install the add-on manually, follow these steps:

From the Apps menu in Splunk, select Manage Apps
Select Install app from file
Select the InsightVM Technology Add-On package
Perform a restart of Splunk when prompted

The add-on should now appear as Rapid7 InsightVM under the Apps menu in Splunk.
Configuration
The following details the configuration of the technology add-on in order to perform retrieval and ingestion of
InsightVM data.
Creating a connection
A connection must be created within the add-on to facilitate the retrieval of InsightVM data. This connection utilizes 
a generated Insight platform API key. The following details how to generate a new API key:

Login to the Insight platform here
Select the gear icon on the top menu and click API Keys
Select Organization Key
Select + New Key
Enter a name for the key and click Generate
Copy and securely store the generated key

Once you have an API key, you can configure a connection for the technology add-on in Splunk. To create a connection, 
follow these steps:

Navigate to the Rapid7 InsightVM technology add-on, available under the Apps menu in Splunk
Select Configuration
Select Add
Enter a name for the connection
Enter your region. Additional info on regions is available here
Enter your generated API key
Click Add

Inputs
There are two types of inputs in the technology add-on, and three sourcetypes that result from these inputs. They are:

rapid7:insightvm:asset
rapid7:insightvm:asset:vulnerability_finding
rapid7:insightvm:vulnerability_definition

When configuring the inputs it is important to select the proper index for storing the imported events. The Technology 
Add-On defaults to an index name of rapid7; however, the index is not automatically created. Make sure to either have 
 a Splunk administrator create the rapid7 index or select an index that already exists.
InsightVM Asset Import
The InsightVM Asset Import can be configured to perform an import of two types of data from InsightVM: assets and 
(optionally) vulnerability findings. To configure this input, select Inputs from the technology add-on menu, then 
select InsightVM Asset Import under Create New Input.
The fields for this input are as follows:



Field
Description




Name
The name of the input as it will appear in Splunk


Interval
The frequency in seconds that the import of InsightVM data will occur. Default is once per hour


Index
Your preferred Splunk index for data. Default is rapid7


InsightVM Connection
The InsightVM connection, created as per the instructions in the Configuration section above


Asset Filter
A query for filtering assets that are imported


Import vulnerabilities
An option for whether to import vulnerability findings into Splunk in addition to assets


Vulnerability filter
A query for filtering vulnerability findings that are imported



Here are some example asset filters that can be applied within this input configuration:

sites IN ['site-name']
tags IN ['tag-name']
os_family = 'Windows'

And some example vulnerability filters:

cvss_v2_score > 6
severity = 'Critical'

InsightVM Vulnerability Definition Import
The InsightVM Vulnerability Definition Import is used to import vulnerability definitions from InsightVM. This can be 
used to correlate with vulnerability findings, should you want to import those, as well. This input is not required 
for visualizing asset findings in your environment. However, it does provide additional details about the 
vulnerabilities.
The fields for this input are as follows:



Field
Description




Name
The name of the input as it will appear in Splunk

InsightVM Connection
The InsightVM connection, created as per the instructions in the Configuration section above


Vulnerability filter
A query for filtering vulnerability definitions that are imported



Important Note: Due to the large amount of data contained within vulnerability definitions, we recommend
importing them a maximum of once per day.
Data Visualization
We've also created the Rapid7 InsightVM Dashboard as a starting point for visualizing data that's imported with the 
InsightVM technology add-on. The dashboard can be installed as an app much like the add-on and further customized to 
suit your visualization needs.
FAQs
Does the asset input import all assets each time it is run?
No. When the asset import is run for the very first time, it will default to importing assets that were scanned within 
the past 90 days. After that, all subsequent imports will only pull in assets that have been newly scanned since the 
last import occurred. In other words, if the last import of data occurred on June 5 at 12 PM, then only assets that 
have been scanned between then and now will be imported.
Does the vulnerability definition import input import all definitions each time it is run?
Yes, all vulnerability definitions will be imported each time it is run. For this reason, we recommend running this 
import at a maximum of once per day.
Can I identify whether a vulnerability has been remediated?
Yes, all vulnerability findings will have a finding_status when they are imported into Splunk. Those that are 
remediated will have a finding_status of remediated.
How do I know if a vulnerability is new versus remediated?
Check the finding_status of a vulnerability finding to determine whether it's new, remediated, or unchanged. The 
new and remediated statuses indicate new and remediated vulnerabilities respectively, while the status found 
indicates a previously found, unchanged vulnerability finding.
Why am I not seeing any data in my add-on/dashboard?
Check the selected index and time period for filtering data. These often need to be adjusted to filter correctly 
for assets and vulnerabilities. In addition, if the default rapid7 index was defined for the inputs, make sure this 
input has already been created.

A Splunk® add-on providing a custom search command haveibeenpwned to query Troy Hunt's haveibeenpwned API (https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v3/) for known breaches of your (company's) domains or your friends'/family's/enemies'/hardly distantly related someone's/employees'/colleagues' mail adresses.
Please respect people's privacy and adhere to the service's acceptable use (https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#AcceptableUse). I tried respecting the limits posed on the API's use in the command's source code, which is why you'll have to have a little patience when querying for large amounts of mail addresses.
I was unsatisfied with the publicly available Splunk add-ons already providing this functionality as they either didn't allow control over what and how is queried for or didn't format the output to my wishes. So I came up with my own Splunk add-on implementing these missing features.
Cross-compatible with Python 2 and 3. Tested on Splunk Enterprise 8.2.3 and 8.1.1 on Windows, Linux and Splunk Cloud.
Licensed under http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.
Feel free to submit issues via https://github.com/hRun/SA-haveibeenpwned/issues.
Installation & Updating
Just unpack to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps on your Splunk search head and restart the instance. Use the deployer in a distributed environment.
Important note on updating to add-on version 2.x.x: 
When updating from add-on version 1.x.x to 2.x.x, you'll be required to reconfigure used API key and proxies (see Requirements & Setup). Un-privileged users without the list_storage_passwords capability will no longer be able to make use of mode=mail. A custom role can_query_hibp is supplied to empower such users (including all negative implications this capability brings with it until Splunk finally decides to fix it).
For legacy Splunk environments, if you prefer a slimmer implementation or if the stated capability limitations are not an option, please use add-on version 1.2.3. Overall functionality is exactly the same. 
Set python.version=python2 or python.version=python3 in commands.conf if you would like to explicitly specify the Python version to use. Otherwise this will be determined by your instance's global settings. Set python.version=python2 in restmap.conf if you experience issues with the app's configuration page on older Splunk instances.
Requirements & Setup
Your Splunk instance requires acess to the internet (via a proxy) to query https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v3/*. Configure proxies via the app's configuration page if required.
Unfortunately parts of the HIBP API now require an API key which you can obtain here: https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/Key. Specify your API key via the app's configuration page to be able to use mode=mail. mode=domain will work without an API key.
Usage
Use as a search command like so:
search index=example | table email | haveibeenpwned [mode=<mail|domain>] [threshold=<days>] [pastes=<all|dated|none>] <field-list>
mode: Control whether to query for breaches regarding one or multiple domains or specific mail addresses. Default: mail.
threshold: Set how many days to look back for breaches. Default: 7 days.
pastes: Control whether to additionally query for account pastes or not or only those with a timestamp when using mode=mail. Default: dated.
Expect the search to take ~ 2 seconds per mail address when using mode=mail due to the API's acceptable use. Do not attempt to spam the search as it will only degrade the performance further.

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3503,2022-01-09,08:23:23 AM,Internet Registry Lookup,,"Dec. 9, 2021","What does it do?
This add-on provides a lookup of all the public Internet subnets in the world. This includes IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. You can perform a CIDR lookup of any public IP address and know what subnet it is associated with at the regional Internet registry (RIR). The add-on provides an automatic mechanism to update this lookup.
What does it not do?
It does not replace iplocation, though it does give the country code when available. It does not identify the assignee by name, only by registration ID. There is no lookup available for these registration IDs, but it is possible (and sometimes useful) to search for ranges with the same registration ID. It does not give information about sub-assignments within ranges, only the direct assignments from the RIR.
Why would I want to use this?
If you ever wanted to know what subnet to block based on abuse or other undesirable traffic from one or more hosts, this add-on will quickly tell you what subnet anything on the Internet is on without having to manually look it up at the registry. If you ever wanted to monitor or measure traffic based on subnet, organization (resource holder ID) or country, this add-on can help you do it.
Where does it get its data?
Updates come directly from each RIR via HTTP. Each of the five registries maintains 'extended statistics' files for their address spaces.
IPv4 is assigned/allocated by range, not subnet. How does this add-on handle that?
CIDR lookup is only by subnet, thus this add-on breaks ranges down into a minimal set of subnets. Ranges that span multiple subnets represent a minority of IPv4 assignments and allocations.
Why include 'available' or 'reserved' ranges?
Sometimes, traffic mysteriously comes from address spaces that are not allocated or assigned.
How much of my license will this use?
None. The RIR data does not go into an index, only a lookup table. Splunk only indexes the Python script status events, and they go into the unmetered internal index (_internal).
That’s a lot of CSV data. Why not use the KV Store?
CIDR lookups against the KV Store are slow. Really, really slow.
Where is the documentation?

Mainframes power mission-critical applications around the world. But many organizations are still flying blind, with no easy way to derive operational intelligence from the vast amounts of machine data generated by these critical systems.
It’s time for data streams from the mainframe to be as accessible as your other data streams when it comes to analytics for business intelligence and security monitoring.
Syncsort Ironstream enables you to collect and forward z/OS log data, including security data, into Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Enterprise Security, where you can get that true 360-degree view.
Users can then easily search, analyze, and visualize the data for powerful business intelligence reporting -- without needing specialized expertise and different monitoring systems for z/OS.
Make more sense of the massive machine data piled up in your mainframe.

What is AppDynamics?
AppDynamics is an application performance monitoring solution that helps you:
Identify problems such as slow and stalled user requests and errors in a production environment.
Troubleshoot and isolate the root cause of such problems by: 
Mining performance data from AppDynamics and viewing it in Splunk using the AppDynamics Controller REST API. 
Pushing notifications on policy violations and events from AppDynamics to Splunk so that a Splunk user can use those to launch deep dives in AppDynamics. See Getting Notifications From and Launching AppDynamics in Splunk.
Installation
These instructions assume that you are familiar with using both AppDynamics and Splunk. 
Links within this file go to AppDynamics 4.2 documentation. If you are running an earlier version, use the Search feature to find the associated topics.
Prerequisites

You have installed AppDynamics version 4.0 or newer. If you do not already have a license, you can sign up for a trial license. You can choose either a SaaS solution or an On-Premise installation.
You have installed Splunk version 6.x or newer.
You have installed the AppDynamics App for Splunk from Splunkbase. 
You have access to the following AppDynamics Controller information, which is required to set up the integration: 
hostname/IP address
port number
account name
user name

password
If you use a SaaS account, AppDynamics provides you with the required information.
- You have access to the AppDynamics documentation. When you trial or buy the product, AppDynamics provides access credentials to you.
- $SPLUNK_HOME is set to the directory where Splunk is installed.


Steps

Install the appdynamics app from splunkbase and before restarting perform steps 2 and 3.
Locate and edit the files: $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/appdynamics/default/metrics.conf and $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/appdynamics/default/events.conf

In the metrics.conf file, add one section for each individual metric you want to mine from AppDynamics. You need the following:

AppDynamics metric name, to name the section in the metrics.conf file, and for use as as unique identifier in Splunk
REST URL of the metric from the AppDynamics Metric Browser, see the AppDynamics REST documentation  (login required).
polling interval - how frequently, in seconds, Splunk will run the script to get this metric

For example, if you want to mine a metric called AverageResponseTime for the ViewCart.sendItems business transaction, the entry would be similar to this:
[ViewCart.sendItems_AverageResponseTime]  
url = http://<controller-host>:<port>/controller/rest/applications/Acme%20Online%20Book%20Store/metric-data?metricpath=Business%20Transaction%20Performance%7CBusiness%20Transactions%7CECommerce%7CViewCart.sendItems%7CAverage%20Response%20Time%20(ms)&time-range-type=BEFORE_NOW&duration-in-mins=15  
interval = 60



In the events.conf file, add one section for each individual event type you want to mine from AppDynamics. You need the following:

AppDynamics event type, to name the section in the events.conf file, specify the event query for the REST URL, and for use as as unique identifier in Splunk
AppDynamics event severity, to specify the event query for the REST URL
REST URL of the event type from the AppDynamics Metric Browser, see the AppDynamics REST documentation  (login required).
polling interval - how frequently, in seconds, Splunk will run the script to get this metric

For example, if you want to mine events caused by application changes, the entry would look similar to this:
[Server.application_Changes]  
url = http://<controller-host>:<port>/controller/rest/applications/Acme%20Online%20Book%20Store/events?time-range-type=BEFORE_NOW&duration-in-mins=15&event-types=APP_SERVER_RESTART,APPLICATION_CONFIG_CHANGE,APPLICATION_DEPLOYMENT&severities=INFO,WARN,ERROR  
interval = 60



Restart splunk. 

You will be prompted to setup the AppDynamics App. Please click on setup and configure the AppDynamics credentials. Using this view, splunk will store AppDynamics credentials in encrypted mode.
If you want to add more entries to the events.conf or metrics.conf without restarting splunk, please find the python 
processes running for metrics.py and events.py and kill them. It will automatically get restarted and it will pick up the new configurations in the conf files.

Splunk Indexes
For metrics, an index called ""appdynamics"" is created. 
For events, an index called ""appdynamics_events"" is created. 
Metrics

Launch the AppDynamics App in Splunk.
Enter index=appdynamics in the Search field of the AppDynamics App in Splunk.  


Events

Launch the AppDynamics App in Splunk.
Enter index=appdynamics_events in the Search field of the AppDynamics App in Splunk.  


Proxy Support
If the connection to the AppDynamics controller has to go through a proxy, you need to replace the following line
from the metrics.py and events.py 
myhttp = httplib2.Http(timeout=10)
Replace the above line with
myhttp = httplib2.Http(timeout=10,proxy_info = httplib2.ProxyInfo(httplib2.socks.PROXY_TYPE_HTTP, 'localhost', 8000))
Please make sure to replace 'localhost' and 8000 with the correct proxy settings. 
SSL Support
If the connection to the AppDynamics controller is over SSL, you can import the certificates by replacing the following
line from the metrics.py and events.py
myhttp = httplib2.Http(timeout=10)
Replace the above line with 
myhttp = httplib2.Http(timeout=10,ca_certs = '<path_to_certificate>')
Please make sure to replace '<path_to_certificate>' with the correct path in your environment.
Cross App linking to AppDynamics


Add the following field extraction section to your $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/search/default/props.conf file:
[source::http-simple]  
EXTRACT-AppD = url=""http[s]?:\/\/(?<nurl>[^""|]+)""



Add the following workflow action to your $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/search/default/workflow_actions.conf file:
[LaunchAppD]  
display_location = both  
fields = url  
label = Launch in AppDynamics  
link.method = get  
link.target = blank  
link.uri = http://$!nurl$  
type = link



Dependencies
The appdynamics splunkbase app depend on the open source library httplib2.

This app provides field extraction, cim mapping(authentication) for CA Privileged Access Manager (PAM) in Splunk.
The field extraction accepts both Splunk native tcp/udp connections and rsyslog style syslog.
CA PAM supports both syslog and xsuite for Splunk, we do recommend use syslog which contains more information for investigation purpose.
Configuring Rsyslog
The timestamp of syslog format from CA PAM is not aligned. If you use rsyslog, you can reconfigure your rsyslog.conf as following:
For Redhat 8:
#module(load=""builtin:omfile"" Template=""RSYSLOG_TraditionalFileFormat"")
$template CustomFormat,""%timegenerated% %HOSTNAME% %syslogtag%%msg:::sp-if-no-1st-sp%%msg:::drop-last-lf%\n""
module(load=""builtin:omfile"" Template=""CustomFormat"")
For Redhat 7:
#$ActionFileDefaultTemplate RSYSLOG_TraditionalFileFormat
$template CustomFormat,""%timegenerated% %HOSTNAME% %syslogtag%%msg:::sp-if-no-1st-sp%%msg:::drop-last-lf%\n""
$ActionFileDefaultTemplate CustomFormat
Configuring Splunk
This app need to install on Splunk Search Head.
Install this app into Splunk by doing the following:

Log in to Splunk Web and navigate to ""Apps » Manage Apps"" via the app dropdown at the top left of Splunk's user interface
Click the ""install app from file"" button
Upload the file by clicking ""Choose file"" and selecting the app
Click upload
Restart Splunk if a dialog asks you to

Configure the input sourcetype as ca:pam:syslog.
Useful macros
We do provided different useful macros which can correlate different logs. This is the most powerful part of this apps. You should explore those macros. Those name of macros are starting with CA_PAM*.
Also, we have provided some example inside macros.conf, you can extend the power by defining the correct lookup files and AD domain.
If there is any performance issues when using those macros, you can consider install this app on Heavy Forwarder/Indexer, create a new index, and enable TRANSFORMS-index_ca_pam inside props.conf and transforms.conf.",Version 1.0.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/716b503e-5d08-11ec-99e9-766bccb1cabb.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,21,0,splunk,5,1,CyberSecThreat Developer,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/cybersecthreat,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

The goal of this tool is very simple: It brings all the Information you need to create CIM compliance TA or check an existent TA at one single point. That´s one main problem, to find all needed information because they are widely scattered, but the SA CIM developers do a great job and documented they work right in the data models. In addition, the apparently confusing logic of the CIM makes it hard to find a clear way to find all the relevant field mappings. The funny story is that CIM tries to normalize the Information and itself is full of redundancies und and double field names with different meanings. Of course, there is a leeway between being precise and a global view. This tool can help you balancing on the line.The CIM Buddy shows you which fields are relevant while you develop a TA with CIM compatibility and present the result of your development. You can examine if your fields are mapped correctly, if tagging works or what the SA CIM searches write into the data model.Watch the Walk Through in the main app folder.",Version 1.2.2,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/00a66656-6ca1-11ec-aa0d-ee63f89816e1.png,Utilities,https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,28,0,splunk,0,0,Christian Lauber,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/clauber,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

The search used can produce any number of separate box plots on a single chart, within the the maximum limit of 10,000. It is unlikely someone can get 10,000 box plots on a single dashboard and obtain any value from the display, so this limit is likely sufficient.
The split by field (Service in the shipped example discussed below) must be the first field returned in the series. The rest of the fields may come in any order as long as the names match the required values: median, min, max, lowerquartile, upperquartile, iqr, lowerwhisker, upperwhisker.
For example, using the lookup shipped with the app, which looks like:
Service,Cost
Consulting,602
Sales,432
Manufacturing,1144
Marketing,814
The search looks like:
| inputlookup boxplotexample.csv | stats median(Cost) AS median, min(Cost) AS min, max(Cost) AS max, p25(Cost) AS lowerquartile, p75(Cost) AS upperquartile by Service | fields - count | where isnotnull(median)| eval iqr=upperquartile-lowerquartile | eval lowerwhisker=median-(1.5*iqr) | eval upperwhisker=median+(1.5*iqr)
The Box Plot Viz app does not, yet, handle outliers. However, in a future version using macros, outlier support will be added due to the complexity of searches involved causing using the app to be overly cumbersome for most users. It is already more than a standard viz requires from the user.
Thanks go out to:

Kevin Kuchta (http://kevinkuchta.com/) for extensive JavaScript assistance for rebuilding the original app to use pre-calculated inputs rather than raw data from a file.
Kyle Smith (https://www.aplura.com) for invaluable help both in understanding the complexities and sublteties of creating viz apps and assistance reworking the code to work correctly in the Splunk Custom Visualization framework.

ToDo:

Needs outlier handling.
Possibly build macros to make the search more friendly.

Install
This app can be installed on a Search Head for on-premise Splunk Enterprise customers. For customers using Splunk Cloud, install this app on your search head for victoria experience customers or both your IDM and SH for classic customers.
Install the app. For Splunk Cloud, refer to Install apps in your Splunk Cloud deployment. For customer-managed deployments, refer to the standard methods for Splunk Add-on installs as documented for a Single Server Install or a Distributed Environment Install.
Configuration
By default the app comes with a pre-configured and disabled input named nhs_cyberalerts, that will fetch cyber alerts daily via REST API and store them in the default index. This input needs to be enabled via the UI. 
It is best practice to place your cyber alerts into another index other than the default main index, please make sure you update the macro 'default_index' with definitions such as index=<YOUR_INDEX>
Usage
Once installed, from your Splunk instance Web Interface, select the app DSPT Compliance and navigate through the dashboards to verify content.
The app aims to assist in DSPT assertions where IT staff are asked to regularly review certain activity types or provide evidence against assertions. Where a monitoring requirement is required the dashboards found within the 'Audit"" drop-down can be used. Where Evidence is required, reports can be found to facilitate the capture of the required information.
Known Issues
There are no known issues at this time.
Troubleshooting
Useful SPL searches to:
Verify Cyber Alerts indexing index=_internal nhs_cyberalerts.py
Verify the index has been populated with Cyber Alerts index=main
Please replace main with the index specified in the configuration and make sure the time range is set on All time
Upgrade
No special instructions for upgrading this app to a newer version.

Give your Splunk end-users the possibility to commit changes to their own Apps to a subversion repository.
""VControl"" provides GUI extensions to the Splunk SearchHead to commit changes on Dashboards, Views, SavedSearches, etc. to subversion. End-users can browse their revision logs, check for file-diffs, and see the file contents for their apps.
Configuration
The App has to be installed on the SearchHead only
App Configuration
Copy the file $APP_HOME/default/svn.conf.example to $APP_HOME/local/svn.conf and change its content according to your needs
Put an app under version control
Initially, Apps have to be put manually  under Subversion control. To use an already created App in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps with ""VControl"", do the following
i.e. put the example App ""webstats2.0"" under control of ""VControl"":

Create a subversion repository (i.e ""my_apps"") if not already exists
checkout ""my_apps"" in a /tmp directory --> /tmp/my_apps
move $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/webstats2.0 to /tmp/my_apps
add and commit /tmp/my_apps/webstats2.0 to subversion
go to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps and checkout ""webstats2.0"" with subversion
from now on, you're able to use ""VControl"" to track changes of webstats2.0

See next chapter ""App Naviation"" to see how you can add an Admin Navigation link to ""webstats2.0"" to give end-users the posibility for versioning their changes 
App Navigation
To add the possibility for end-users to version their own Apps, there are two globally defined views (""versioncontrol"" and ""versioncontrol-revisions"") that you can include in their Apps navigation path.
For example, if you want to give the owner of the ""Webstats2.0"" App the posibility to use ""VControl"", include following lines in the navigation menu ""default.xml"" of ""Webstats2.0"":
<collection label=""Admin"" >
    <view name=""versioncontrol"" />
    <view name=""versioncontrol-revisions"" />
  </collection>
See following screenshot as an example:

Troubleshoot
Enable logging by configuring python ""splunk.svn"" stanza in the log-local.cfg file
i.e.
#> cat $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/log-local.cfg
[python]
splunk.svn = DEBUG

Splunk App that auto updates the max-mind database (used for iplocation command)
Find Sourcecode on GitHub - https://github.com/VatsalJagani/Splunk-App-Auto-Update-MaxMind-Database
OVERVIEW
The Splunk app auto updates MaxMind database. The database update happens automatically every week. Also, user can update database just by running a search query. This is automation of steps mentioned here - https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.1.3/SearchReference/Iplocation#Updating_the_MMDB_file

Creates Index - False
Compatible with:
OS: Platform independent
Browser: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari

TOPOLOGY AND SETTING UP SPLUNK ENVIRONMENT
This app can be set up in two ways: 
  1. Standalone Mode: 
     * Install the Auto Update MaxMind Database.
     * App setup is required.
  2. Distributed Mode: 
     * Install the Auto Update MaxMind Database only on the search head.
     * App setup is required on SH.
     * App installation is not required on any other instance.
INSTALLATION
Follow the below-listed steps to install an App from the bundle:

Download the App package.
From the UI navigate to Apps > Manage Apps.
In the top right corner select Install app from file.
Select Choose File and select the App package.
Select Upload and follow the prompts.

CONFIGURATION

Open the App and perform the configuration.
The complete details about configuration is present on the dashboard directly.
See troubleshooting for more details.

INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION FOR INDEXER CLUSTER

iplocation is distributed command, so based on search queries Splunk will decide whether the command is executed on SH or indexers. So it is recommended to deploy the App on Search Head as well as on indexers.
Follow below steps to deploy App on indexers.

Way-1: Deploy on all indexers from cluster master.
Note - If you do not want to add Max Mind License key in plain text, use Way-2.

App will be pushed from cluster master so, you don't have to deploy App manually on each indexer separately.
Download the App build from Splunkbase.
Extract the downloaded app build on Cluster master's $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/master-apps/ directory.
Create local directory under $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/master-apps/splunk_maxmind_db_auto_update/.
Add app.conf file in the newly created local folder.

[install]
is_configured = 1

Add passwords.conf file in the newly created local folder. And replace <LICENSE_KEY> in the below code with your MaxMind license key.

[credential:splunk_maxmind_db_auto_update:max_mind_license_key``splunk_cred_sep``1:]
password = <LICENSE_KEY>
Way-2: Deploy on each indexer manually
Follow INSTALLATION and CONFIGURATION section from above to install and deploy app on indexer. The process is same as hwo you deploy App on Search Head.
UNINSTALL APP
To uninstall app, user can follow below steps:
 SSH to the Splunk instance
 Go to folder apps($SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps)
 Remove the splunk_maxmind_db_auto_update folder from apps directory
 Restart Splunk
KNOWN LIMITATION

NA

OPEN SOURCE COMPONENTS AND LICENSES

NA

TROUBLESHOOTING

Update database manually.
Run | maxminddbupdate search from the Auto Update MaxMind Database App.
In ideal scenario, it should show message Max Mind Database updated successfully..
Confirm that the database location has been updated:
Run | rest /services/configs/conf-limits splunk_server=local | search title=""iplocation"" | table title, db_path.
The results should show /opt/splunk/etc/apps/splunk_maxmind_db_auto_update/local/mmdb/GeoLite2-City.mmdb. Where /opt/splunk is your Splunk home path, it could be different in your environment.

Upgrading the Add-on to v1.1.0 from 1.0.0

If you want to disable SSL certificate validation, then follow the below steps:
Navigate to path: $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-purestorage-unified/local/. If folder local is not present at the location: $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-purestorage-unified/, create folder named local at the location.
Check for file: ta_purestorage_unified_settings.conf at location: $SPLUNK_HOME/TA-purestorage-unified/local/. If the file is not present, create the file ta_purestorage_unified_settings.conf at the location.
In file $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-purestorage-unified/local/ta_purestorage_unified_settings.conf add stanza purestorage_additional_parameters at the end of the file and set the value of verify_ssl variable to False as done below :
[purestorage_additional_parameters]
    verify_ssl = False
Restart Splunk



APPLICATION SETUP
After installation:

Navigate to PureStorage Unified TA, click on ""Configuration"" page, go to ""System"" tab and then click ""Add"", choose ""System Type"", fill in ""System Name"", ""Server Address"" (without the https scheme) and ""Authentication/JWT Token"" then click the ""Add"" button.
If ""System Type"" is FlashBlade/FlashArray, provide API Token in the ""Authentication/JWT Token"" field.

If ""System Type"" is Pure1, provide JWT Token in the ""Authentication/JWT Token"" field.
Note:

Please follow from the section ""Create Key Pair"" section in the following documentation to generate the JWT token for the Pure1 system: https://blog.purestorage.com/products/introducing-the-pure1-rest-api/. You need to provide the JWT token (not Access token) while configuring a Pure1 system in Splunk.
To get the API token, use the below CLI command that can be issued against FlashArray or FlashBlade.
    pureadmin list --api-token --expose
For System Type Pure1, only one input can be configured corresponding to one Pure1 System. Trying to configure multiple inputs with same Pure1 System is not allowed.





Note:

If you have already configured a FlashBlade or FlashArray Input, then configuring a Pure1 input associated with the same FlashBlade and FlashArray or vice versa would lead to duplicate data/events in Splunk and will increase Splunk data volume and license usage.
The data for Pure1 > metrics/history endpoint will be collected for end_time as current_time - 1hr, because the data is updated with delay in Pure1 API, and Splunk data collection is completed before the delayed update is made available.
If the Start Date configured by the user is greater than current_time - 1hr, data for the metrics/history endpoint will not be collected.",Version 1.1.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/8b8e7c46-43ec-11ec-bfbe-9299a9ad30e8.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,265,0,splunk,5,2,Pure Storage,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/puresplunk,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

When an index reaches its maximum size, Splunk deletes the oldest indexed events. This can occur whenever an index has not been correctly sized.
Splunk Monitoring Console already provides means to monitor how your indexes are filling up helping you spotting any full or nearly full index.
Therefore, you usually just have to extend the size of a nearly full index to avoid losing data.
However, this task could become redundant if indexes' size are being extended with no regards for the actual volume of data they ingest.
This can be avoided by having your indexes correctly sized.
To correctly size an index, you have to be able to predict what will be its size when it reaches the configured retention period.
To be able to estimate that final size, you obviously need to know how much data this index will ingest every day.
The problem is that it could be difficult to know the average daily volume of data that will receive an index beforehand. This volume can also vary widely over time.
This App provides visibility on your indexes' filling by calculating the final size of each index based on the daily average volume of data ingested, and by comparing it to the current index configuration.
Hence, the goal of this App is to provide a simple way to check on the sizing of your indexes in order to avoid data loss and redundant index re-sizing.
Version 1.0.2
Release Notes
1.0.0: July 2018

Initial release

1.0.1: September 2018

Fixed 'Index Configuration' view

1.0.2: September 2018

Minor fix

Insight
To check on the daily volume of data ingested by each index, this App uses Discovered Intelligence's Meta Woot! (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2949/)
This later App provides great insights from your Splunk metadata and license usage.
To build its knowledge on your license consumption, it uses a dedicated accelerated Data Model.
The Meta Woot License Usage Data Model aggregates data from your license_usage.log file ingested in the _internal index.
We thought it was more convenient to use this Data Model because we do use Meta Woot and wanted to avoid having to maintain a duplicate data model and also because we are already using this Data Model with our previous App, Internal Billing (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4041/).
Prerequisites
1 - Deploy Meta Woot! (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2949/) on your Splunk Search Head.
2 - Configure acceleration for Meta Woot's License Usage Data Model.
It can be achieved by ticking Accelerate from Settings > Data models > Meta Woot License Usage > Edit > Edit Acceleration and by setting the Summary Range to 7 days.
3 - Configure global permissions for Meta Woot's License Usage Data Model to be able to access the aggregated data outside of Meta Woot!.
This can be done by selecting 'Display For All apps' from Settings > Data models > Meta Woot License Usage > Edit > Edit Permissions and by making sure to at least set read permissions for the role that will be used to launch the App.
4 - Configure the '_internal' index as an allowed index for your role. As Meta Woot's License Usage Data Model gathers data from the '_internal' index, your role should be able to query this index.
It can be set by adding '_internal' index to the allowed indexes attached to Settings > Access controls > Roles > [Your role].
5 - In a distributed environment, make sure internal data from your License Master is being indexed on your Indexers and therefore available from your Search Head(s).
You should retrieve results from the following query: index=""_internal"" sourcetype=""splunkd"" source=""*license_usage.log"" type=""Usage""
6 - If deployed on an earlier version of Splunk (pre 7.1) add 'color=""#333333""' to the first line of the default navigation menu (Settings > User interface > Navigation menus > default).
Configuration Steps
REST URIs for rest API calls:
Splunk queries part of this App consist in REST API calls. It should work as-is if your Splunk platform is quite simple since the queries are expecting results from your Indexer(s) only.
If, however, your Splunk platform is more complex (i.e. if the search peers configured on your Search Head(s) are not only Indexer(s)), then you might have to adjust queries by specifying the appropriate REST URI.
For instance, '| rest /services/data/indexes' would become '| rest splunk_server=<rest-uri> /services/data/indexes' with <rest-uri> possibly containing wildcards (i.e. '| rest splunk_server=splunk-indexer* /services/data/indexes').
Replication factor for Indexer Cluster:
To predict what will be the final size of an index, the following formula is being used in both 'Index usage' and 'Global usage' dashboards:
daily average volume indexed by indexer in GB x 0.5 (average compression) x replication factor (if applicable) x retention period in days
As the replication factor could only be obtained by making an API CALL to the Cluster Master, it has not been integrated in the queries.
Therefore, if you run an Indexer Cluster, you must find out what is the replication factor and then add it to the queries.
To find out what replication factor is applied to your Indexer Cluster, you can use the following query from you Cluster Master:
| rest splunk_server=local /servicesNS/-/-/configs/conf-server
| search replication_factor=*
| fields replication_factor site_replication_factor multisite eai:acl.app
| rex field=site_replication_factor ""total\:(?<repFactor>\d+)""
| eval replication_factor=if(multisite==1,repFactor,replication_factor)
| fields - multisite site_replication_factor repFactor
Then, you should integrate its value to both queries.
In 'Index usage' dashboard, expectedIndexSizeGB=consumedDailyPerIndexerGB0.5frozenTimePeriodDays would become expectedIndexSizeGB=consumedDailyPerIndexerGB0.5<your_replication_factor>*frozenTimePeriodDays.
In 'Global usage' dashboard, expectedIndexSizeGB=round((consumedDailyGB0.5frozenTimePeriodDays),0) would become expectedIndexSizeGB=round((consumedDailyGB0.5<your_replication_factor>*frozenTimePeriodDays),0).
In any case, double check on the value obtained for expectedIndexSizeGB to make sure it is coherent to your platform.
App deployment
Deploy the App on your Search Head.
Use the App
Once ready to use, 'Index usage' is the main dashboard to visit as it provides a glimpse into your indexes statistics and configurations.
From there you can drilldown to either 'Index Configuration' or 'Time-base ingestion' dashboard.
The 'Time-based ingestion' dahsboard provides the daily ingestion volume by index for a wider period - 30 days - displayed as a timechart. You can also pick several indexes from there.
Comparing to the 'Index usage' dashboard, the 'Global usage' dashboard provides global insights on your indexes' sizing and configuration.
The 'Age of data' dahsboard lets you quickly check on the age of the data for each index.
Finally, the 'Index configuration' dashboard let you browse your current index configuration to check on the various parameters. You can pick multiple indexes and configuration parameters for comparison.
Alert
One alert is included in this App.
Whenever an index reaches 90% of its maximum size, the 'Index nearly full' alert is triggered.
The alert has been disabled by default. Adjust and enable it as preferred.

Welcome to the Splunk for Squid app! This app provides field extractions for Squid access logs as well as a dashboard and a request search interface.
This app is maintained by Patrik Nordlen. Suggestions and bug reports are appreciated.
Installation
To install, extract the .spl file in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps
You will need to enable the appropriate inputs, either via inputs.conf, or through the Manager in the Splunk GUI. Splunk for Squid expects Squid access logs to have a sourcetype of ""squid"".
Using Splunk for Squid
Field extractions
The most basic feature provided by this app is to extract fields from Squid access logs. The following fields are extracted:

duration (Time in milliseconds required for handling the request)
clientip (Client IP address)
action (Resulting action for a request, like TCP_HIT or TCP_MISS for instance)
http_status (The HTTP status returned for a request)
bytes (The amount of bytes returned to client, including headers)
method (HTTP method)
uri (Requested URI)
uri_host (Host portion of the requested URI)
uri_path (Path portion of the requested URI)
username (Username associated with the client connection)
hierarchy (Hierarchy data tags)
server_ip (The IP address of the destination host)
content_type (Content type for data returned)

These field extractions are applied to all logs with sourcetype ""squid"".
Request search
The app includes a custom search interface for Squid requests, available under ""Request search"". This interface shows tables and statistics for requests handled by Squid.
Dashboards
A traffic dashboard is provided, showing statistics over time for amount of requests and bandwidth consumed, as well as statistics concerning most prominent client IP addresses and destination sites.",Version 0.2,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/6d35ee3e-6900-11e3-b4de-005056ad5c72.png,IT Operations,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,"7,541",0,splunk,5,10,Patrik Nordlén,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/patrik,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

Uses the Weather API for current weather data, and requires a valid OpenWeather API key. The free license allows up to 60 calls per minute.
Sourcetype:
This add-on uses the included sourcetype openweather:current:json for the collected events. The event timestamp is set after the dt field in the event data.
Installation:
Download and install directly from Splunk, or download from Splunkbase and untar the package in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ directory. 
Configuration:
Go to the OpenWeather Current Add-On for Splunk in the Splunk Enterprise menu and access the configuration section where you have to add the OpenWeather account with the associated API key as password. 
Next we need to configure an modular input in the Inputs section, here we need to define the index where Splunk is going to collect the events and the Interval for collection. It is recommended that you create a dedicate index for this data. 
Also is required to specify a localization method and fill the value field from this method. The available localization methods are: CityID, ZipCode, or Geolocalization (latitude, longitude), with the following values:


CityID: value: <city_id>. Example: 12345


ZipCode: value: <zip_code>,<country_code>. Example: 1234,cn


Geolocalization: value: <lat>,<lon>. Example: -12.34,56.78


The units of measurement setting allows to select one of the following options:


standard: temperature in Kelvin.


metric: temperature in Celsius.


imperial: temperature in Fahrenheit.

PREREQUISITES

Splunk running on Linux OS (does not currently run on Splunk installations on Microsoft)
Tenable Nessus scanner 6.x
Python 2.7 on Splunk indexer
Python ""requests"" module on Splunk indexer
This is included in this TA under the ""bin"" directory for more info on requests see http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install/.

DESCRIPTION
The Add-on for Nessus allows a Splunk administrator to ingest Nessus vulnerability information directly from the Nessus product using an API.
This provides the index- and search-time functions for the vulnerability data by converting the output of Nessus web API calls into JSON documents via a python scripted input.
By default, this TA will create files and place them in the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-nessus_json/drop directory. Once this creation process is completed, they will be moved to the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-nessus_json/pickup directory. A monitor stanza in the inputs.conf file will then acquire the Nessus JSON data from the pickup directory.
INSTALLATION
The add-on needs to be installed on the indexer and the searchhead if in a distributed environment. In non-distributed environments, the indexer and searchhead are the same device and will only need to be installed at this central point.
GUI Installation:

Download the app from Splunkbase
From the Splunk web interface, click on App -> Manage Apps to open the Apps Management page in Manager
Click the ""Install app from file"" button, locate the downloaded file, and click ""Upload""

Command Line Installation:

Download the app from Splunkbase
Uncompress the tar file and move the entire app folder to the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps location
Restart the Splunk service/process (using either the UI (Settings/Server Controls/Restart Splunk) or by command line ($SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk restart))

NOTE: There have been issues with installing this TA via a deployment server. It is recommended that this TA be installed directly and not via a deployment server. Solutions are being researched.
CONFIGURATION
These items should be configured in order for this TA to function properly:

URL of Nessus API
Account Credentials for Nessus API or preferably the API keys (please see Nessus documentation for version 6.4+ on generating keys)
Scan IDs to import (OPTIONAL)
Scheduling (OPTIONAL)

Note: All references to indexer or searchhead are made assuming there is a distributed environment. If Splunk is not configured in a distributed environment and the indexer and searchhead are one device, refer to these references as simply your one Splunk instance.
1. URL of Nessus API

Open a terminal connection to the indexer
Edit the file $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-nessus_json/bin/nessus2splunkjson.py
Find the ""url"" line (number 12) referencing the URL of the Nessus scanner and replace the example with your Nessus host and port

2. Account Credentials for Nessus API

Open a terminal connection to the indexer
Edit the file $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-nessus_json/bin/nessus2splunkjson.py
Find lines 18 and 19 referencing the username and password for an account on the Nessus scanner and replace the examples with an account on the Nessus service. Beginning with Nessus version 6.4, you may use API keys to login instead of hardcoding a username and password for an account into the script, these can be entered on the ""accessKey"" and ""secretKey"" lines (49 and 50, respectively). Please see Nessus documentation for version 6.4+ on how to generate these access keys.

Note: The Nessus account used must have read access to the scans that will be imported via the API. If using a version of Nessus that allows for multiple accounts, the specified account must be explicitly given read access to each scan.
3. Scan IDs to Import (OPTIONAL)
Note: The default configuration will import ALL scans. Follow these steps to limit the scans to only those specified.
Note: The default configuration will import ALL scans. Follow these steps to limit the scans to only those specified.

Open a terminal connection to the indexer
Edit the file $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-nessus_json/bin/getscanID.py
Make the same adjustments to this script for the URL (""url"" on line 12), username (line 18), and password (line 19) that were made in the previous two steps to nessus2splunkjson.py Preferably commencing with Nessus version 6.4, you may use API keys to log in lui of a username and password, these can be entered on lines 14 and 15. Please see Nessus documentation for version 6.4+ on how to generate access keys.
From the terminal, execute $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-nessus_json/bin/getscanID.sh (this will create a file with the name ""getscanID_(timestamp).log"")
Open the newly created file to see a list of detected scan names and associated IDs
Open $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-nessus_json/bin/nessus2splunkjson.py for editing
Copy the desired scan IDs for importing and place them into a comma-separated list on the ""sa"" line (number 27)
Uncomment the ""sa"" line (number 27)
Comment out the ""sa"" line on (line number 242)

4. Scheduling (OPTIONAL)
By default, the script needs to be run manually. To have it execute automatically, see the ScriptSetup page on the Splunk Docs for instructions on how to set this up.
http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/6.2.3/AdvancedDev/ScriptSetup
IMPORTING DATA

Open a terminal connection to the indexer
Execute $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-nessus_json/bin/nessus2splunkjson.sh
Watch in amazement as the script outputs its status
Results of the scan will be written to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-nessus_json/bin/nessus2splunkjson_results_(timestamp).log
If problems are encountered (such as Nessus connection issues), errors will be written to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-nessus_json/bin/nessus2splunkjson_errors_(timestamp).log

Note on Historical IDs: This script keeps track of the historical IDs (in the the hid_history file) that have been processed so that duplication does not occur and subsequent imports are more efficient. All scans that have been specified will be marked for import, including each historical ID within the scan. If the status of the historical ID is running, it will be skipped. All other statuses will attempt to import. However, some aborted and pending scans may not have any host data and thus no data will be imported.
Note on Indexes: This script will import data to the default Splunk index. Changes can be made to this in inputs.conf.
DEFINITIONS

HID = Historical ID is an instance of a specific Nessus scan
PID = Nessus plugin ID
SID = Scan ID is a numerical reference to a Nessus scan name

CONTACT INFO AND FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
Feature requests, bug reports, complaints, blatant praise, and support questions (provided on a best effort basis only) can be sent to splunk@almorga.com
Potential future enhancements:

Create a scheduled lookup table for plugin ""descriptions"" in order to reduce data ingress
Front-end GUI
Switch to uuid historical record instead of hid
Remove iterating through completed HID and just process the difference or new scans since last run
Sorting scan name from getscanID script
Microsoft windows version
Make it fast like Speedy Gonzales

This app will run on Splunk version 6.5.x.
This app requires the Splunk eventgen to be running on your instance of Splunk, as this app relies on generated data. 
Installation
The app will create 3 indexes:
    * splexamples
    * splexamples_downloadcount
    * splexamples_mysummary
Add this app (Splunk SPL Examples) to your Splunk instance, via your normal process.
This app will require the Splunk Eventgen to be running, which can be downloaded from Splunkbase.
After the app is added and the Splunk Eventgen app is installed then the Splunk instance will need to be restarted for the indexes to get created and the Eventgen to read the eventgen.conf within the app.
General
This add will generate data that will count against your license. This app will not generate more than 25MB per during normal daily operations. Note that the app doe perform a backfill operation that may crate more than 25MB on the initial installation date.
The indexes created are limited in size to the following:
    * splexamples - Maxsize 25MB
    * splexamples_downloadcount - Maxsize 1MB
    * splexamples_mysummary - Maxsize 1MB

The data was created by ExactData LLC for the ADAMS project, an Insider Threat program at DARPA (https://www.cert.org/insider-threat/). There a 10 data sets for the project: https://www.cert.org/insider-threat/tools/index.cfm
Details of the TA:
The TA has props and transforms that provide Splunk's Common Information Model (CIM) mapping for R6.1 data set for the following log types: 

HTTP
File
Logons
Device
Email

You can download R6.1 from here: ftp://ftp.sei.cmu.edu/pub/cert-data/r6.1.tar.bz2
Background:
The Insider Threat datasets were made for the ADAMS, an Insider Threat program at DARPA (https://www.cert.org/insider-threat/). This TA works on R6.1.tar.bz data set. R6.1 set is availble here: ftp://ftp.sei.cmu.edu/pub/cert-data/r6.1.tar.bz2
About DataSet- R6.1:
The TA  includes a ""samples"" directory that contains 9 entries from each log type. The R6.1 dataset provide both synthetic background data and data from synthetic malicious actors: 

""Device (USB)"", HTTP, Email, Files, Logons
Contextually relevant data including psychosomatic reviews of users (HR), LDAP ""user"" information (not included in the TA)
An answer directory is included that provides descriptions of the scenarios enacted and the identifiers of the synthetic users involved (or the ""answers"" to the scenarios)

Scenarios in the data set:

Unusual use of removable drives (after hours, uploading, leaving soon afterwords)
Job dissatisfaction

OVERVIEW
Technology add-on (TA) for CrowdStrike enables current CrowdStrike customers to ingest alert data from the Streaming API as well as view and push custom indicators via the Query API. 
This TA also supports (and is required for) the CrowdStrike Falcon App for Splunk: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3943/

Author - CrowdStrike
Creates Index - False
Compatible with:
Splunk Enterprise version: 6.4.x, 6.5.x, 6.6.x, 7.0.x, 7.1.x, 7.3.x, 8.0.x
OS: Platform independent
Splunk Cloud (Heavy Forwarder Required)



For more information about the CrowdStrike APIs please refer to ‘Docs’ under the ‘Support’ section in the Falcon Interface.

DEPLOYMENT
Prior to deploying this Technology Add-on review the following:

To receive event data a valid and enabled set of credentials for the Streaming API is required. This consists of an API UUID and an API Key. These can be generated through the Falcon UI and if being generated for the first time CrowdStrike support should be notified to enable the Streaming API. NOTE regenerating this credential set WILL INVALIDATE AN EXISTING SET.
To view and/or push custom indicators to the Falcon platform a valid set of credentials for the Query API is required. This consists of a username and password. Currently these can only be acquired through CrowdStrike support. Please refer to the Query API documentation for details on this process.
Ensure that any Proxies or Firewalls that the API communications will traverse have been properly configured (see the ‘Configuration Section’ – ‘Configuring Proxies’). The APIs currently leverage certificate-based authentication (TLS over port 443) and should be exempted from any SSL proxying.

Ensure that any Firewalls in the environment will allow the Streaming API connection to establish a long-life HTTPS connection. This connection is maintained to reduce latency of alert reporting. 
Please refer to the API documentation in the Falcon UI for specific URLs and IP addresses that should be whitelisted.



INSTALLATION
There are currently two components within a Splunk environment where this TA should be installed: Heavy Forwarders and Search Heads. Install the TA bundle by:

Downloading the TA package
In the UI navigate to: “Manage Apps’
In the top right corner select ‘Install app from file’

  6.  Enter the host information for the proxy
  7.  Enter the port used by the proxy
  8.  Enter a valid username
  9.  Enter a valid password
Configuring CrowdStrike Account(s)
The TA can be configured with two different CrowdStrike APIs credentials:
  *  Streaming API: This will provide event and audit data
  *  Query API: This will provide custom indicator visibility and push capability

Navigate to Technology Add-on for CrowdStrike, 
In the sub-menu select ""Configuration"" 
In the right corner select “Add Account”
Enter a unique name for the configuration (NOTE: Names cannot contain blank spaces)
Select the API account type
Streaming – The Streaming API requires an active API UUID and API Key and is used to receive alerts from the Falcon platform.
Query – The Query API is used by the ‘CrowdStrike Falcon App For Splunk’ to show and upload custom indicators to the Falcon platform.


Enter either an API UUID or Username (depending on the API type selected)
Enter either an API Key or Password (depending on the API type selected)
Verify that the information that has been entered is correct and select ‘Add’
Note at this point the TA will attempt to validate the entered credentials. If the credentials are not correct, not active or a connection cannot be established the account will not be added. 

Configuring CrowdStrike Input(s)
In a distributed architecture and for Splunk Cloud this configuration should only be done on the Heavy Forwarders
DO NOT CONFIGURE INPUTS ON SEARCH HEADS OR SPLUNK CLOUD

Navigate to Technology Add-on for CrowdStrike, 
In the sub-menu select ""Inputs” 
In the right corner select “Create New Input”
Enter a unique name for the configuration
From the drop down select the appropriate account for the input type
(optional) Enter the offset number after which to collect data
(optional) Enter the start date from which to start the data collection
Enter the time interval for input
Select the index to store the data. NOTE The main index is used by default unless otherwise indicated. If a custom index in selected ensure that the “cs_get_index” macro is updated accordingly. If data is to be sent to a specific indexer ensure the outputs.conf file is adjusted with the Indexer’s IP address.

SPLUNK CLOUD CONSIDERTATIONS
This TA contains a data collection component and as such, per Splunk’s documentation, should be installed on a forwarder (only heavy forwarders are currently supported by CrowdStrike) for the data collection function:
“Apps and add-ons that contain a data collection component should be installed on forwarders for their data collection functions. See Install apps in your Splunk Cloud deployment.”
Using Custom Indexes
The TA creates a search macro that, by default, points to the ‘main’ index. If the data being collected is placed into a custom index this macro should be updated to reflect the index being used. The Endpoint and Intelligence TAs each leverage their own search macro. Search macros can be found under ‘settings’ -> ‘advanced search’.
    To modify this settings, perform the following:
  1.  Select ‘Settings’
  2.  Select ‘Advanced Search’
  3.  Select ‘Search Macros’
  4.  Select the appropriate CrowdStrike Technical Add-on
  5.  Select the name of the macro
  6.  Under definition ensure that the index being referred to in quotations is the index the data resides in
NOTE: The CrowdStrike App for Splunk leverages search macros to populate dashboard information. Failure to properly configure these macros can result in no/incorrect information being displayed.

SAMPLE EVENT GENERATOR
The TA comes with sample data files, which can be used to generate sample data for testing. In order to generate sample data it requires the SA-Eventgen app(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1924/). The TA will generate sample data for API calls at a 2 hour interval. You can modify this configuration from eventgen.conf file available under $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/default/.

TROUBLESHOOTING
Using Search
After several minutes use the following search to validate that data is being received:
`cs_get_index` | stats count by sourcetype

NOTE the macro MUST be enclosed with backticks to run correctly (on most keyboards this key is located to the left to the number 1 key – these are not apostrophes.
Below are some sourcetypes types that maybe returned:

crowdstrike:falconhost:json
crowdstrike:falconhost:query:json

Using Log Files

$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/ta-crowdstrike_falcon_host_api.log
$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/ta-crowdstrike_ucc_lib.log files.
$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/crowdstrike/

Connectivity Issues

Unable to save account input(s)
Ensure that the credentials matches the API type
Ensure that the API has been enabled by CrowdStrike Support
Ensure that Proxy settings have been properly configured in the TA
Ensure that Proxy and Firewall settings have been properly configured to allow unmodified communication


Receiving ‘401’ connection errors
Ensure that the credentials being leveraged have been entered correctly
Ensure that the correct credential sets are being used for the input
Ensure that the credentials have been activated by CrowdStrike support
Ensure that Proxy and Firewall settings are properly configured to allow unmodified communication


Not receiving data
Ensure that the API credentials have been activated by CrowdStrike support
Ensure that an input has been created
Ensure the proper credentials are assigned to the input  
Ensure that Proxy settings have been properly configured in the TA
Ensure that Proxy and Firewall settings have been properly configured to allow unmodified communication
(Splunk Cloud) Ensure that the collection activity is being performed by a heavy forwarder



External Credential Validation
Leverage a platform such as ‘Postman’ or the ‘curl’ command to validate connectivity and that the credentials are correct. For example of commands to run refer to the appropriate API guide in the Falcon UI.

It provides CIM compliant field names, eventtypes and tags for NetFlow Optimizer data.
The Add-on can also be used to generate sample events for testing purposes, it contains samples of netflow data and config files for the event generator.
Setup after installation - Splunk Enterprise:

The TA-netflow is expecting that the sourcetype of events sent from Netflow Optimizer would be set to ""flowintegrator"". To set it up please create the $SPLUNK_ROOT/etc/apps/TA-netflow/local/inputs.conf file, and add the following lines to it:
    [udp://10514]
    sourcetype = flowintegrator

By default NetFlow Optimizer events will be stored in main index. In case you want to use another index, please create the  $SPLUNK_ROOT/etc/apps/TA-netflow/local/indexes.conf file, and add the following lines to it:

        [flowintegrator]
        homePath    = $SPLUNK_DB/flowintegrator/nfi_traffic/db
        coldPath    = $SPLUNK_DB/flowintegrator/nfi_traffic/colddb
        thawedPath  = $SPLUNK_DB/flowintegrator/thaweddb

You also need to make sure your $SPLUNK_ROOT/etc/apps/TA-netflow/local/inputs.conf file contains the following:

        [udp://10514]
        sourcetype = flowintegrator
        index = flowintegrator


Restart splunk for the configuration changes to take effect.

Setup after installation - Splunk Cloud:

Set up the forwarding to your Cloud Instance, the recommended method can be found here:
https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Forwarder/latest/Forwarder/HowtoforwarddatatoSplunkCloud

The TA-netflow is expecting that the sourcetype of events sent from Netflow Optimizer would be set to ""flowintegrator"". To set it up, on the UF forwarding to the Splunk Cloud please create the $SPLUNK_UF_ROOT/etc/system/local/inputs.conf file if it does not exist, and add the following lines to it:

        [udp://10514]
        sourcetype = flowintegrator

[Optional] By default NetFlow Optimizer events will be stored in main index. In case you want to use another index, please create the index based on these instructions:
https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/latest/User/Manageindexes

On the UF forwarding to the Splunk Cloud please create the $SPLUNK_UF_ROOT/etc/system/local/inputs.conf file if it does not exist, and add the following lines to it, assuming that the new index was named flowintegrator:

        [udp://10514]
        sourcetype = flowintegrator
        index = flowintegrator

Install the app. Setup a new KV - or pick an existing one to use. Configure a Splunk alert to use the newly-available action.
If your collection has the following fields, they will be populated: _time, alert_title, data (see below), metadata, search_name severity.
Choose whether to store the event data using the fields from your search results (e.g. | table a b c) or to render all of the event data as a single json string in a kv field called data. If doing the latter, you can unpack the json at search time using | inputlookup your_lookup | eval _raw=data | spath | fields - _raw, data
Mandatory parameters to the action include:
- collection
- app
- owner
Optional parameters:
- alert_title
- severity

TROUBLESHOOTING
General Checks

To troubleshoot Lansweeper Add-on For Splunk, check $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/Splunk/ta_lansweeper*.log or user can search index=""_internal"" source=*ta_lansweeper*.log query to see all the logs in UI. Also, user can use index=""_internal"" source=*ta_lansweeper*.log ERROR query to see ERROR logs in the Splunk UI.
Note that all log files of this Add-on will be generated in the $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/Splunk/ directory.
App icons are not showing up: The Add-on does not require a restart after the installation for all functionalities to work. However, the icons will be visible after one Splunk restart post-installation.
After updating fields for workflow actions in the Add-on Settings page, open a new tab or clear the browser cache to reflect the changes.

Correlation

Check that the correlation searches are enabled or not from the Searches, Reports, and Alerts tab on Splunk.
Check that for given search query there is any data for the past 30 minutes.
Check that the proper Title is given for the correlation search.

Lookup

If it seems that the lansweeper_site_mapping_lookup lookup is not having any site_id, then check that the newer token is generated or not.
Check ta_lansweeper_validators.log file for further analysis.

Custom Command

Check the newer token is generated for your application, then update the newer one in Configuration -> Account page.
Check ta_lansweeper_lsip_command.log or ta_lansweeper_lsmac_command.log file for further analysis.

Dashboards


Panel not populating in Investigation dashboard:

Live Investigation mode:
If the data is not populated then ensure that the lansweeper_site_mapping_lookup lookup is filled with Site IDs & Site Names.
Check ta_lansweeper_validators.log file for lookup filled successfully or not.
Another scenario can be the newer token is generated for the same application. In this case, update the new token in Configuration -> Account page.
Proxy server can be down, in that case use a working proxy server.

HTTP user-agent parser as described by RFC7231.
Usage
http_user_agent=* | lookup uaparser_lookup http_user_agent | spath input=http_user_agent_parts
Or with the macro:
http_user_agent=* | `uaparser(http_user_agent)`
Example
http_user_agent=""Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; en) Opera 8.50""
Output Fields:

ua.string: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; en) Opera 8.50

ua.products: 2


ua.product1.name: Mozilla

ua.product1.version: 4.0

ua.product1.comment: compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; en


ua.product2.name: Opera 8.50

ua.product2.version: null
ua.product2.comment: null

Note that the second product in the previous example return 'Opera 8.50' as the name of the second product. This is not a bug. The parser is correctly working as described by the RFC7231. The user-agent sent by the browser is simply malformed (so not compliant with the RFC).
Use Case
Then, you can for example create a contingency table to cross Mozilla product versions with the MSIE versions. By spotting the outliers you may find intereting stuff in your proxy logs ;)
Example of a query:
http_user_agent=*Mozilla*| fields http_user_agent | `uaparser(http_user_agent)` | eval product = 'ua.product1.name' . ""/"" .

The events are automatically categorized as follows:
Multisession Analysis
High Priority Events
IDS Events
Network Logs (3rd party logs sent to the sensors)
File Transmission Analysis
User Discovery
Service Discovery
Host Discovery
Mac Discovery
Suspicious URL Transmission Analysis
IPS Notifications
User Rankings
Modsecurity
Events volumes are also broken down by addresses, ports and other important invariants like sensor names, domains types, applications, etc.. It is possible to click on all summary records fileds to either drilldown on Splunk or drill down on the MetaFlows' web application to obtain more detailed forensic information like packets payloads.
Splunk app Installation
-- App Installtion --
The app is available from SplunkWeb[2]. Please download and install the application using your Splunk application manager. The app receives syslog messages on tcp port 3015 encapsulated using SSL. The default installation includes a generic self-signed SSL certificate in the cert directory. This certifcate was generated using the commands:
         export OPENSSL_CONF=$SPLUNK_HOME/openssl/openssl.cnf
        $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/genRootCA.sh -d $SPLUNKHOME/etc/apps/SplunkforMetaFlows/certs
        $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/genSignedServerCert.sh -d $SPLUNKHOME/etc/apps/SplunkforMetaFlows/certs -n splunk -p
We recommend you generate a new SSL ceritificate using your own phassphrase by repeating the commands above.
The passphrase you enter when generating the certificate should then be placed in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SplunkforMetaFlows/default/inputs.conf under the [SSL] stanza as:
        password = <yourpassword>
-- Sensor Configuration --
In order for Splunk to receive MetaFlows's sensors event you need to add the following line to your /nsm/etc/mss.sh startup script
export SYSLOG2=<splunk_host_ip_address>:3015
where <splunk_host_ip_address> is the ip address of the host where Splunk is running. After this, restart your sensor(s) with the command
/nsm/etc/mss.sh restart
Make sure that tcp port 3015 is open and the sensor can communicate with your Splunk host.",Version 1.2,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/e922c5e6-5b8a-11e7-8384-02f13bdc2585.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html,260,0,splunk,0,0,Livio Ricciulli,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/livioricciulli,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

Setup and Install
This TA is deployed on Forwarders, Indexers and Search Heads.
Indexer
This TA can be deployed to the indexer without any further changes.
It is recommended to create a new index called cacti.  An indexes.conf file is not included with this TA.
Search Head
Install and Deploy the app to the search head.
On the search head, the add-on will provide:
 * search time extractions, lookups, macros and event types
To complete the install, you will need to update the follow:
 * macros.conf
   * cacti_index: replace index=cacti with the appropriate index
Cacti Server / Universal Forwarder
To complete the ingestion of data, deploy the Splunk_TA_Cacti to the forwarder installed on the same host as your Cacti implementation.  If you have multiple installs, you can deploy it across multiple Cacti servers.
For this add-on to work, you will need to have installed the Cacti Mirage plugin to the Cacti servers.  
Cacti Mirage: http://docs.cacti.net/userplugin:mirage
Cacti Mirage Github: https://github.com/n00badmin/mirage
In addition, you will need the following information:
 * Path to Cacti install (i.e. /var/www/html/cacti or /usr/share/cacti)
 * Path to mirage_poller_output.log (i.e /var/www/html/cacti/log/mirage_poller_output.log)
 * Index to send data to (either default or index=cacti, etc)
For deploying the add-on, copy the following files from the default directory to the local directory.
 * inputs.conf
Edit the local/inputs.conf file and make the following changes:
 * enable all inputs stanzas: change disabled = true to disabled = false
 * modify all stanzas to reflect the appropriate destination index (i.e. index=cacti)
 * [monitor:///usr/share/cacti/log/mirage_poller_output.log*]
    * Set to the correct path to the mirage_poller_output.log file.  This file is generated by the Cacti Mirage plugin
 * [monitor:///usr/share/cacti/log/cacti.log]
    * Set to the correct path to the cacti.log file, which is most likely in the log/ folder inside the Cacti install.
 * [script://./bin/cacti_lookup_mirage.py /usr/share/cacti]
    * Change /usr/share/cacti to the folder where you installed Cacti",Version 1.0.1,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/5b664446-c6ce-11e5-81fc-0a2568125881.png,"IT Operations, Utilities",http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html,591,0,splunk,5,6,Menno Vanderlist,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/mvanderlist_splunk,"Products: Splunk Enterprise

Add-on Homepage:
Author: Hurricane Labs
Version: 1.0.7
Description
The purpose of this add-on is to provide CIM compliant field extractions for Cisco Umbrella OpenDNS logs AWS S3 bucket logs.
This add-on requires the Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services as the means of data on-boarding.

Built for Splunk Enterprise 6.x.x or higher
CIM Compliance (CIM 4.0.0 or higher)
Ready for Enterprise Security
Requires Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (unless using Cisco Managed S3)
https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876/


Supports Cisco Umbrella Log Management Version 1-5

INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
Search Head: Required
Heavy Forwarder: Optional
Indexer: Optional
Universal Forwarder: Not Supported
Light Forwarder: Not Supported
Ultimately this add-on needs to be installed on your Search Head and on the AWS Add-on collection point. It is recommended that you setup the AWS inputs on a Heavy Forwarder, and it is recommended that you setup the Cisco Umbrella Add-on on the Heavy Forwarder and Search Head. If you are using your Search Head as the AWS collection point, then this only needs to go on your search head. If your AWS collection point is on your Indexer, then this add-on needs to go on the Indexer and on your Search Head.
Setting up AWS Input
Reference Link: https://support.umbrella.com/hc/en-us/articles/230650987-Configuring-Splunk-for-use-with-Cisco-Umbrella-Log-Management-in-AWS-S3
1. Refer to the reference link to configure AWS and set up the account in Splunk, you can follow the rest of the steps in this guide when you reach the ""Configuring Data Inputs for Splunk"" step.
2. Navigate to the Splunk Add-on for AWS
3. Create a new input (Custom Data Type > Generic S3)
4. Select the appropriate AWS Account/Role/S3 Bucket
5. (Recommended) Do not set a S3 Key Prefix, and change the sourcetype to ""opendns:s3"".
5. (Optional) If you want more control over the data you bring in, you'll need to do separate inputs using these S3 Key Prefixes ""/proxylogs/"", ""/dnslogs/"", ""/firewalllogs/"", ""/auditlogs/"" and ""/iplogs/"". Each of these will use it's own sourcetype: ""opendns:dnslogs"", ""opendns:proxylogs"", ""opendns:firewalllogs"", ""opendns:auditlogs"", and ""opendns:iplogs""
Heavy Forwarder & Search Head (RECOMMENDED)

Install the add-on on the Heavy Forwarder and Search Head. A Splunk Restart may be required, you may also attempt a debug refresh.
Configure the AWS Input to scrape your OpenDNS S3 bucket;
2a. One Input: If you scrape the entire bucket, you NEED to use sourcetype ""opendns:s3""
2b. Multiple Inputs: If you want more control over the buckets being scraped, this add-on supports multiple inputs. There are three types of logs sent by Umbrella OpenDNS; ""/proxylogs/"", ""/dnslogs/"", ""/firewalllogs/"", ""/auditlogs/"" and ""/iplogs/"". Each input should use exactly one of those prefixes. The respective sourcetypes for those prefixes are as follows; ""opendns:dnslogs"", ""opendns:proxy"", ""opendns:firewalllogs"", ""opendns:auditlogs"" and ""opendns:iplogs"".
Verify data is coming in and you are seeing the proper field extractions by searching the data.
Example Search: index=awsindexyouchose sourcetype=opendns:* | dedup sourcetype

Search Head Only

Install the add-on on the Search Head. A Splunk Restart may be required, you may also attempt a debug refresh.
Configure the AWS Input to scrape your OpenDNS S3 bucket;
2a. One Input: If you scrape the entire bucket, you NEED to use sourcetype ""opendns:s3""
2b. Multiple Inputs: If you want more control over the buckets being scraped, this add-on supports multiple inputs. There are three types of logs sent by Umbrella OpenDNS; ""/proxylogs/"", ""/dnslogs/"", ""/firewalllogs/"", ""/auditlogs/"" and ""/iplogs/"". Each input should use exactly one of those prefixes. The respective sourcetypes for those prefixes are as follows; ""opendns:dnslogs"", ""opendns:proxy"", ""opendns:firewalllogs"", ""opendns:auditlogs"" and ""opendns:iplogs"".
Verify data is coming in and you are seeing the proper field extractions by searching the data.
Example Search: index=awsindexyouchose sourcetype=opendns:* | dedup sourcetype

Indexer and Search Head (NOT RECOMMENDED)

Install the add-on on the Indexer and Search Head. A Splunk Restart may be required, you may also attempt a debug refresh.
Configure the AWS Input to scrape your OpenDNS S3 bucket;
2a. One Input: If you scrape the entire bucket, you NEED to use sourcetype ""opendns:s3""

Cisco Managed Buckets Instructions
Reference Links:
https://support.umbrella.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000739983-How-to-Downloading-logs-from-Cisco-Umbrella-Log-Management-using-the-AWS-CLI
https://support.umbrella.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001388406-Configuring-Splunk-with-a-Cisco-managed-S3-Bucket
The AWS Add-on can NOT be used to pull data from Cisco managed S3 buckets. The only way to get this data in is through the use of the awscli tool. This should be setup on a Splunk Enterprise system that is meant for data ingestion (such as a Heavy Forwarder). You need to install this add-on on your Search Heads and the system handling data ingestion. The steps below will ONLY apply to your data ingestion box, NOT your Search Heads. I have only tested this on Ubuntu and we will not provide any further support/guidance on this, these steps are provided as is:
-1. Install awscli via apt-get (apt-get install awscli)
-2. In $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-cisco_umbrella/bin create two shell scripts. If you want the shell script write to a different location, make sure you change the paths in both shell scripts!
pull-umbrella-logs.sh
#!/bin/sh
unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH
unset PYTHONPATH
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<KEY\_HERE> AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<KEY_HERE> AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<REGION_HERE> aws s3 sync s3://<CISCO_BUCKET_PATH_HERE> /opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-cisco_umbrella/data
delete-old-umbrella-logs.sh
#!/bin/bash
#Removes old data depending on the ""Retention Duration"" configured in the Umbrella dashboard --> Admin --> Log Management:
a) 7 days:
find /opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-cisco_umbrella/data -type f -name ""*.csv.gz"" -mmin +11520 -delete 2>&1 >/dev/null
b) 14 days:
find /opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-cisco_umbrella/data -type f -name ""*.csv.gz"" -mmin +21600 -delete 2>&1 >/dev/null
c) 30 days:
find /opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-cisco_umbrella/data -type f -name ""*.csv.gz"" -mmin +44640 -delete 2>&1 >/dev/null
The suggested values leave a one day buffer for safety.
#Removes old directories with no data
rmdir /opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-cisco_umbrella/data/dnslogs/*
-3. Verify that Splunk is actually able to run the shell scripts without issue by running '$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk cmd sh $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-cisco_umbrella/pull-umbrella-logs.sh'. If this does not work, there is a problem with your setup or keys.
-4. If you are using a different path than my example, you will need to create $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-cisco_umbrella/local/props.conf and alter this stanza to match:
[source::/opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-cisco_umbrella/data/dnslogs/...]
TRANSFORMS-umbrella-logs_source = remove_umbrella_date_from_source
-5. In $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-cisco_umbrella/local/inputs.conf create the following stanzas. Make sure you change the path and index in the monitor stanza if necessary!
[script://./bin/pull-umbrella-logs.sh]
disabled = 0
interval = 300
index = _internal
sourcetype = cisco:umbrella:input
start_by_shell = false
[script://./bin/delete-old-umbrella-logs.sh]
disabled = 0
interval = 600
index = _internal
sourcetype = cisco:umbrella:cleanup
start_by_shell = false
[monitor:///opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-cisco_umbrella/data/dnslogs/*/*.csv.gz]
disabled = 0
index = opendns
sourcetype = opendns:dnslogs
-6. Verify data is coming in and you are seeing the proper field extractions by searching the data.
----Example Search: index=awsindexyouchose sourcetype=opendns:dnslogs
----Note: You can look for script output by searching: index=_internal sourcetype=cisco:umbrella:*

This app allows you to apply fuzzy logic to lookups from your search result fields for near-matches.  Use cases include:  

Domain analysis (lookalike domains)  
Blacklist similarity  
Typo identification  

Supported Splunk versions: 7.3.x, 8.0.x
Configuration Steps: N/A

Fuzzylookup search command (fuzzylookup)
Syntax:
search | fuzzylookup 
    [ prefix=<string> ]
    [ addmetrics=[True|False] ]
    [ lookupfilter=<kvpairs> ]
    [ mask=<regex> ]
    [ delete=<regex> ]
    <lookup-table-name> 
    ( <lookup-field> [AS <event-field>] ) 
    [ OUTPUT | OUTPUTNEW (<lookup-destfield> [AS <event-destfield>] ) ... ]

Description
Cross-reference your search fields against lookup data for non-exact matches, with the fields from the lookup entry/entries with the best score being appended to the event. 

The Levenstein algorithm (from the jellyfish library) is applied to compute a match score.  
If there are multiple entries with the same score, the tie is broken by how many characters are exact matches.  
If multiple entries still have the same result, the lookup data is added to the event as multivalue fields.  


Lookups can be filtered to limit comparisons with event fields and improve performance. Wildcards are supported.  
Static filters apply for the entire lookup and limit the global dataset being used.  
Dynamic filters take data from each search result into account, and reference event field names.  
The following example contains a static filter followed by a dynamic filter, which references the email_domain field in each event:  




lookupfilter=""LookupField1=\""local admin\"" Lookupfield2=\""*@$email_domain$\""""


Data filtering is supported to limit the number of comparisons being made.  
For example, a email address comparisons can be limited to those where the domains match:  


Text masking and deletion is supported via regex. This masks or deletes the event field data and the lookup data in memory, prior to any comparisons being made.  
Data can be sanitized before comparison to treat certain character classes equally. The following example deletes the domain from an email address, deletes dot (.) and underscore (_), and masks all numbers. 




delete=""(@[^@]+$|\\.|_)"" mask=""[0-9]""

Arguments


Prefix
Syntax: prefix=<prefix_text>
Description: Text to prefix all output field names with. Helpful for applying to every lookup field without aliasing each one.  


Add Metrics
Syntax: addmetrics=[True|False]
Description: Add fuzzy match metrics to each result (score, matching characters, similarity score, consecutive match length).
Default: False


Lookup Filter
Syntax: lookupfilter=""<lookup_field>=\""lookup_value\"" <lookup_field>=\""$event_field$\""""
Description: Filter for data in the specified lookup to reduce the number of comparisons  


Text Masking
Syntax: mask=""<regular expression>""
Description: Mask pattern for both compared sets of values. Masks the regex matched text before comparing.  


Text Deletion
Syntax: delete=""<regular expression>""
Description: Deletion pattern for both compared sets of values. Removes the regex matched text before comparing.  


Standard lookup operators (see Syntax)

The Splunk App for VulDB integrates vulnerability intelligence from VulDB into Splunk. The app communicates with VulDB by using its API and requires a valid API key as well as sufficient API credits.
Setup
Installation
Installation from file:
- Log in to Splunk with an administrative account
- Click on the gear icon (Manage Apps)
- On the next screen, click on the button labeled Install app from file
- Click on the button Browse... and browse to the location of the the VulDB Splunk App file (VulDB-Splunk-App.tar.gz), then select that file and click Open in the file browser dialogue. Now the name of the file appears next to the button Browse....
- Check the checkbox Upgrade app to upgrade any older versions of the app should they exist
- Click the button labeled Upload
Online installation:
- Log in to Splunk with an administrative account
- Click on the gear icon (Manage Apps)
- Click on the button Browse More Apps
- in the search box, enter VulDB and press enter
- Click on the button Install to install the VulDB App
Initial Configuration
Before configuring the VulDB Splunk App for the first time, make sure that you have a valid API key and a sufficient amount of API credits. If in doubt, log in to your VulDB account and check your profile.
The VulDB Splunk App defines a new modular input type that is used for retrieving data from VulDB. Navigate to the menu Settings / Data inputs and click on + Add new.
Note: if the app has been configured previously, this step is typically not required as the necessary configuration should already be present.
Give the new modular input a name, for example VulDB-datasrc and insert your API key into the field ""VulDB API key"". Optionally, you can specify a proxy server for outgoing connections, i.e. connections to https://vuldb.com from your Splunk server. You can also choose the language for the data fetched from VulDB, the choices are:

English
German
Spanish
French
Italian
Polish
Swedish
Chinese
Japanese

It is possible to define how far from the past the App should start fetching VulDB data (default setting is one month if left empty).  
Clicking on Next will save your configuration and download an initial chunk of data from the VulDB (see below).
Additional Information
The VulDB Splunk App downloads data from https://vuldb.com in several chunks and it checks for new data once per hour. Upon initial data download (i.e. no data has been downloaded previously or only a long time ago), the App attempts to download all data from VulDB that is younger than the configured maximum data age.
Note: this will consume roughly 1000 API credits per month of data coverage (or more), depending on your choice of fetching details and on the amount of vulnerabilities in VulDB for that period.
Usage
When you access the Splunk App, you are presented with an overview dashboard. This dashboard shows some statistics and visualizations of the VulDB data present in your Splunk instance. All visualizations in the overview have drilldowns defined, i.e. clicking on the numbers or graph elements will open a new window containing relevant data and details.
Dashboards
Some predefined dashboards are included with the app. They can be accessed through the menu Dashboards in the menu bar.
You can always add your own dashboards or alter the existing ones. If you choose to change any of the predefined dashboards be aware that this may lead to non-functioning drilldowns in other dashboards.
Reports and Saved Queries
Currently, only one saved search is included with the VulDB app - it will show the VulDB log entries. Feel free to add your own searches as you see fit.
Custom Searches
The VulDB app creates Splunk entries with a sourcetype of VulDB. Therefore you can use sourcetype=VulDB to restrict splunk searches to VulDB data.
Logging
The VulDB App logs events to the splunk logs. A saved search is included in the VulDB app that allows you to retrieve the VulDB App logs, please click on the Reports menu access the saved search.
Changing the Splunk App Configuration
The configuration of the VulDB data source (modular input) can be changed. Click on Settings / Data inputs / VulDB, which will show the previously defined input (or an empty list if you haven't defined the input yet). Clicking on the name of the input allows you to change its parameters.
Updating the App
For instructions on how to update Splunk apps, please refer to the official documentation.
Deleting the App
For instructions on how to disable or delete Splunk apps please refer to the official documentation. Bear in mind that deleting the app will remove the defined modular input but will not remove the VulDB data already present in your Splunk instance.
Fetching Individual Vulnerabilities
It is possible to download one or more vulnerabilities separately from the usual data retrieval mechanisms. Navigate to the menu Settings / Data inputs and click on the field Input Name of the previously defined VulDB data input. Enter the desired VulDB IDs in the field Fetch individual VulDB IDs. Separate multiple IDs with commas if you wish to download more than one vulnerability. Then click the Save button on the bottom of the page. This downloads the specified IDs from VulDB and then clears the Fetch individual VulDB IDs field.

Use Network Behavior Analytics for Splunk to identify malware and suspicious behavior within your networks. Before installing the application, you should be capturing DNS requests from your name servers or infrastructure, and ideally logging IP network traffic from your firewalls or Splunk Stream.
Install the application within Splunk by browsing to Apps > Manage Apps > Find more apps online, and searching for Network Behavior Analytics, or uploading the package to your Search Head.

Product Setup
Once installed, please follow the configuration and activation steps found within https://www.alphasoc.com/docs/.

On-premise Options
By default, this application uses the AlphaSOC Analytics Engine running in a secure enclave in Google Cloud Platform to score network traffic and uncover threats. To deploy an on-premise virtual appliance, please contact support@alphasoc.com to receive a package and deployment instructions.

Analytics Engine Security
The AlphaSOC Analytics Engine API endpoints and source code are audited annually by NCC Group. We have also published a white paper which details the secure enclave architecture and security controls.

Technical Support
Support is available via email to support@alphasoc.com or by leaving a message via +1 (888) 978-4915. While we respond to most support cases immediately, we aim to respond via email within 2 hours.",Version 1.7.7,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/d994432e-4ec0-11ec-8825-2e9c708641fa.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance",http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/legalcode.txt,"4,299",0,splunk,5,4,"AlphaSOC, Inc.",https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/alphasoc,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

Install whatever Splidget app you want. Currently there are three. Feedback, SearchFu!, and or Splunkpad. You will see an icon at the bottom right that will persist and provide you a way to access your Splidget from any of the other Splidget apps you have installed by default. E.g. As you install other Splidgets, their icons will show up in the group as well.  If you would like the same icons in any of your other apps simply drop the dashboard.js file from the Splidget appserver/static directory of any Splidget app into the desired apps appserver/static directory. You will need to bounce the Splunk server to register the new dashboard.js file.  The icons WILL NOT SHOW UP ON THE SEARCH DASHBOARD PROVIDED BY SPLUNK. This page is locked down.

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3383,2022-01-09,08:28:46 AM,Forescout Adaptive Response Add-on for Splunk,,"Dec. 6, 2021","About the Forescout platform and Splunk Integration
Splunk Enterprise data analytics help organizations leverage the data that their infrastructure and security tools provide to understand their security posture, pinpoint and investigate risks, and create alerts and reports. Security operations teams must also rapidly respond to any identified threats, violations and attacks in a prioritized manner. Any delay in response can result in significant security risks. The integrated combination of the Forescout platform’s continuous, agentless device visibility, network access control, dynamic segmentation and workflow orchestration capabilities with Splunk Enterprise’s data mining and Splunk Enterprise Security (ES)'s security information and event monitoring (SIEM) capabilities provides a solution that maximizes insight, dramatically reduces risk and increases operational efficiency.  
Security blind spots are removed by having Splunk easily consume comprehensive information from Forescout such as:
•    Real-time inventory of all network connected virtual and physical devices across IT, BYOD, Guest, IoT and Operational Technology (OT), including new devices with an IPv6 address. Device data can also be sent without dependency on IP address for reporting flexibility. 
•    Endpoint information, such as device type, classification, network connection, operating system, applications, users, peripherals and much much more
•   More accurate user and location context by resolving overlapping IP addresses and layering tenant ID with IP address in meta data
•    Device security posture and compliance gaps
•   Authentication, access, tenant ID and network location information
•   Threat indicators on devices detected by vulnerability scanning
Use Cases
Capitalizing on Forescout's rich contextual information and policy-driven actions together with Splunk helps you tackle the following use cases.
Rapid anomaly detection and accurate trend analysis
Forescout discovers, classifies and assesses all connected devices; compiles this information in the Splunk CIM format and shares it with Splunk. The additional device information from Forescout includes user information, device type, device configuration, network access patterns over time, network location and security posture. Splunk correlates rich contextual data from Forescout with other data sources and uses this information for long-term storage, swift anomaly detection and accurate trend analysis.
Enhanced incident correlation and prioritization
Splunk correlates rich device context from the Forescout platform with other data sources to better identify and prioritize incidents. When Splunk receives alerts from other data sources about a suspicious activity on a device, it shares the information with Forescout. Forescout provides high-value user, network and device context to Splunk. Splunk leverages this additional insight to determine if a suspicious event is actually malicious or violates policy and escalates or reduces the severity of the event based on the device and user context, such as highly privileged or less trusted users.
Automated closed-loop incident response
Forescout scans all connected devices for indicators of compromise (IOCs) and policy violations in real time when alerted by Splunk. Through Splunk’s Adaptive Operations Framework, Splunk operators can initiate Forescout actions—such as isolating or quarantining potentially compromised or noncompliant endpoints depending on the severity of the violation. Forescout can also dynamically trigger policy-based mitigation and response actions until the deviant device is remediated. Forescout then delivers the results back to Splunk to close the loop. Administrators can view the entire lifecycle and final outcome of the event in the Splunk dashboard.
Architecture Overview

Forescout integration with Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud and Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) is enabled by the 
Forescout eyeExtend for Splunk module paired with the Forescout App for Splunk along with the Forescout Adaptive Response and Forescout Technology Add-ons for Splunk.   
The Forescout App for Splunk provides customizable, out-of-the-box queries and dashboards to visualize Forescout data in Splunk, displaying a wealth of information such as:
• Device compliance status
• User types (registered corporate users or guests)
• Device types connected to the network and connection details
• Patterns of network access over time
• Policy trends
• Forescout system health information
• Incident response action status
The Forescout Technology Add-on for Splunk is a required component to streamline data transfer between Forescout and Splunk Enterprise. This Add-on maps Forescout collected device properties to the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) and extracts events based on Forescout data. The Forescout Technology Add-on also maintains Forescout credentials for communications between Forescout and Splunk Enterprise. 
Support for Splunk Adaptive Operations Framework with The Forescout Adaptive Response Add-on

Splunk's Adaptive Operations Framework describes a complete action flow, which includes requesting an action be applied to an endpoint device and tracking the status of the action taken. 
This integration supports the Splunk Adaptive Operations workflow as follows:
-The Forescout App for Splunk maintains a list of available actions from the Forescout platform. Splunk can instruct the Forescout platform to respond to potential threats by applying any of these actions to endpoints that match search/trend criteria.
-To complete the action flow, the Forescout platform reports the status of actions applied to endpoints.
These closed-loop incident response workflows allow you to streamline security operations and minimize business risk by automating the incident management lifecycle with a complete audit trail that also helps with policy refinements.

In Splunk add a HTTP Event Collector data input with a sourcetype of _json. Ensure to enable tokens and disable SSL
Place the splunk.py Ansible callback file, currently in the apps bin directory, into a directory within the root of your Ansible playbook called callback_plugins
Update your ""ansible.cfg"" with settings from the Splunk HTTP Event Collector data input as below

callback_whitelist = splunk
[callback_splunk]
url = http://mysplunkinstance.example.com:8088/services/collector/event
authtoken = f23b1ad6-5965-4537-bf69-b1aa54B1aa88
Now when you run your ansible plays, detailed JSON formatted results will now be sent to Splunk.
Support Ansible Versions
Ansible => 2.5
Known Issues
With Ansible 2.4 the following errors occur:
callback set_options() got an unexpected keyword argument 'task_keys'
Please avoid using Ansible versions below 2.5
Ignoring Invalid SSL Certificates:
We are aware that there is currently no way to ignore invalid SSL certificates when using HTTPS on the Splunk HTTP Event Collector. Valid SSL certificates work fine and here is a link to using Lets Encrypt to get valid certificates. A whilst this outlines the process for Splunk Web the same process slightly modified works fine for the HTTP Event Collector.

Resolved Issues in V 3.5.0

An issue where Security Intelligence Category was not populating properly in Connection events. It is now populating correctly.
An issue where the egress interface was populating with the id instead of the interface name in Intrusion events. It is now populating with the name.
An issue where the fw_policy field name was appearing in Splunk file event output even though the firewall policy name is not part of the file event. The field name has been removed.
An issue where the log reported a process poll timeout error even though the process is healthy and operating normally. The issue has been corrected.
An issue where the name of the source user field was not populating correctly in connection events, intrusion events, file events, and malware events. The field is now populating correctly.
An issue where the sid field in intrusion events was populating with an ""internal sid"" instead of the ""rendered sid"". If a user imports a custom rule file with rules that specify the sid, that sid is the ""rendered sid"" that appears in the FMC interface. The sid field in intrusion events is now populated by the rendered sid.
An issue where the DNS Query field in connection event was not populating correctly. It is now populating correctly.
An issue where in malware events, the virus name/detection name field was not populating correctly. It is now populating correctly.
An issue where eNcore reported the following error: ""UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters … "". The issue has been resolved.
An issue where the packet payload output included layer 2-4 headers for TCP and UDP packets. The issue has been corrected and only the payload (without the layer 2-4 headers) appears in the payload field.
An issue where in correlation events, the cs1 field (for access control policy name) was populating with the uuid instead of the name.

Commands
jira
Syntax
| jira MODE OPTIONS
Modes

List favorite filters of the configured user

| jira filters

Run a specific filter and return Issues

| jira issues FILTER_ID

Run a JQL search and return Issues. The JQL query should be encapsulated by double quotes with criteria encapsulated by single quotes. For example |jira jqlsearch ""key='1234' and reporter='Fred de Boer'""

| jira jqlsearch ""JQL_QUERY""

Run a JQL search and return the all Changes for all matching Issues.

| jira changelog ""JQL_QUERY""

List rapidboards or sprints (Greenhopper REST API)

| jira rapidboards list|all|(RAPIDBOARD_ID [detail sprints|issues])

list will list all scrum boards. This is the default behavior.
all will list all sprints in all scrum boards.

RAPIDBOARD_ID will list all sprints in one specific scrum board.

""detail sprints"" gives details on the active sprints in the rapidboard.
""detail issues"" gives details on the active issues in the board including swimlanes and groupings.
Hint: to get issues in a sprint use jqlquery ""sprint=sprint_id"" after you have found the desired sprint id here with rapidboards.



Pipe search results into a jqlsearch


| search ... | eval foo=""WTF-1,WTF-2,WTF-3"" | makemv delim=, foo | map search=""|jira batch JQL_QUERY $foo$""

The JQL_QUERY in the batch command is a partial query that ends with the IN keyword, e.g. ""key in""
Results piped in from the preceding search will populate the IN clause.
Results piped in can be comma- or space- separated
This is a little ungainly, but quite powerful if you want to pull a list of JIRA keys from an external source and then get all the Issues from JIRA

Options

comments 
Shows comments for all Issues returned by main option.

Compatible with issues, jqlquery, and batch commands.


changefield

By default, pretty names for fields are show. Changefield outputs internal field names instead.

Compatible with issues, jqlquery and batch commands.


changetime TIME_FIELD

Sets _time to the chosen field. If field does not contain a valid, returns 0 Epoch time
_time defaults to created if changetime is not set

Compatible with issues, jqlquery, and batch commands.


fields ""[INTERNAL_FIELD_NAME,...]""

Limits the set of fields returned
Takes a comma-separated list of internal field names. No extra spaces, we're too lazy to trim
If you want multiple fields, please enclose the field list in double-quotes
key and created are always returned

jirarest (REST API - deprecated)
Using Modular Input
From version 2.2.0, you can index JIRA ticket with jira modular input. 
Once the modular input is enabled, it will start sync process which based on jql query to fetches tickets from JIRA server. After sync process finishes, the modular input will get updated tickets every ""interval"" seconds.
This is one example of inputs.conf, for using it, configure your server and credential then copy to local/inputs.conf.
[jira://buttercup]
sourcetype = jira
index=jira
interval = 60
server = jira.buttercup.com
protocol = https
port = 443
jql = issueType in (epic, story)
username = username
password = password
disabled = 1
Deployment

Place the app into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/jira
Create a folder named local, copy default/jira.conf into local, and update with configuration specific to your instance.
Copy $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/jira/bin/config.ini.sample to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/jira/bin/config.ini and update with your authentication credentials

Configure which keys to display in the table with the keys, time_keys, and custom_keys fields.

What is GuardDuty?
Amazon GuardDuty, announced at re:invent 2017, is a continuous security monitoring service that requires no customer-managed hardware or software. GuardDuty analyzes and processes Amazon VPC Flow Logs and Amazon CloudTrail event logs. GuardDuty uses security logic and AWS usage statistics techniques to identify unexpected and potentially unauthorized and malicious activity. This can include issues like escalations of privileges, uses of exposed credentials, or communication with malicious IPs, URLs, or domains.
GuardDuty informs you of the status of your AWS infrastructure and applications by producing security findings that you can view in the GuardDuty console or through Amazon CloudWatch
events.
GDI
A short video that walks through pushing CloudWatch Events generated by GuardDuty to Splunk is available here. Note that these events are delivered to Splunk over HTTP Event Collector
Usage
The ""TA"" is purely for storing KOs to make the specific dashboards work - it does not handle data collection. Since these are CloudWatch Events, both the AWS Lambda Blueprints and SQS-based Mod-Input in Splunk_TA_aws are sufficient.
Both simplexml dashboards (guard_duty.xml and guard_duty2.xml) are examples that can be integrated into the existing splunk_app_aws or extended for your own use.",Version 1.0.4,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/def4fc4e-3922-11e8-b08a-02f13bdc2585.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-software-license-agreement.html,"4,961",0,splunk,0,0,Splunk Works,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/splunklabs,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

The Hurricane Labs Add-On for Unified2 is a Splunk Technology Add-On by
  Hurricane Labs for parsing data stored by Snort or Suricata in the Unified2
  binary format into a Splunk-compatible JSON format. This optionally includes
  packet capture data.
This TA is compatible with the ""Intrusion Detection"" data model in the Common
  Information Model. Its data will populate the Intrustion section in Splunk
  Enterprise Security as well as other CIM compliant Intrusion Detection apps,
  such as the future Hurricane Labs App for Intrusion Detection.
Installation

This TA should be installed into a forwarder on the Snort/Suricata host (this
  can be a Universal, Lightweight or Heavy Forwarder), and the first Splunk
  Enterprise system in the receiving chain (the same host if using a LWF or HF,
  another Heavy Forwarder, or your Indexer - check outputs.conf). There is no
  search head component to this app.
The only required configuration, beyond installation, is done on the
  Snort/Suricata host (referred to as 'the forwarder'). The configuration
  options can be seen in the unified2.conf file inside default in this app.
  There are two sections to this config: output and unified2.
The output section contains configuration for the output of the TA.
 o pretty - enables a more human readable output that may use more of your
   Splunk license. It is disabled by default
 o pcap - enables capture and indexing of packet data. This is enabled by
   default.

The unified2 section contains configuration related to your Snort/Suricata
  installation. If you have used Barnyard2 and/or PulledPork, you may be
  familiar with some of these files.
 o checkpoint_file - this file is used to track the events that have already
   been indexed. This file can be stored anywhere, and defaults to
   /var/log/snort/alert_json.checkpoint
 o input_u2 - Base filename of the Unified2 file written by Snort/Suricata.
   For snort, this is often /var/log/snort/snort.u2 to which Snort then
   appends a timestamp. This setting should NOT have the timestamp
 o sid_msg_map - This is the same as the sid_file config option in
   Barnyard2, and is generated by Pulledpork
 o gen_msg_map - This is the same as the gen_file config option in
   Barnyard2, and is generated by Pulledpork
 o classifications - This is the same as the classification_file config
   option in Barnyard2, and is generated by Pulledpork

Once these settings are configured (which can be done in local/unified2.conf
  to avoid future updates from overwriting your settings), you can then enable
  the scripted input (in local/inputs.conf) by duplicating the section header
  and then setting disabled = 0. You can also adjust the interval (default is
  30 seconds), the sourcetype (not recommended), or set an index (default is
  main).
After enabling the scripted input, you will need to restart Splunk. The
  default behavior, which is not configurable at this time, is to ignore any
  alerts in the Unified2 file if the checkpoint file does not exist. That is,
  the TA will not index any events that occurred BEFORE it was installed.
  After the first run of the script, the checkpoint file will be generated, and
  any future alerts will then be indexed.

The CheckPoint Block Alert Action for Splunk allows organizations to easily block suspicious IPs on their CheckPoint systems. The app includes an adaptive response action and a workflow action.
Release notes
Version 2.0.1 is the fifth release. It contains a bug fix to the alert action. This update is only compatible with Splunk 8+/Python 3. Version 1.0.2 contains an update to the README file. Version 1.0.1 contains minor edits to version 1.0.0. SSL verification of the API call to the management server is disabled because most servers either have self signed or non-existant certificates. You will also need to have a configured CheckPoint firewall for this app to function (it's in the name, so you're probably aware of this already).
About this release
Version 2.0.1 of the CheckPoint Block Alert Action For Splunk is compatible with:



Splunk Enterprise versions
8.0, 8.1, 8.2




Platforms

Prerequisites and Requirements
This app requires that the CheckPoint management server controlling gateways be running a version which supports the R80.x and R81.x web API. Standalone gateways are supported in addition to management servers handling multiple gateways. Gateways do not necessarily need to be running a version running the API if they are centrally managed by a management server which supports the API. By default, the app will issue a block command to all managed gateways. 
The CheckPoint API must be configured to allow remote connections in order for this to operate; the management API doesn’t allow remote access by default. To enable API access, open SmartConsole and navigate to Manage and Settings -> Blades -> Management API -> Advanced Settings. If this setting is changed, you will need to restart the API by SSHing into the management server and running the api restart command.

Adaptive Response
This app contains compatibility with the Enterprise Security feature Adaptive Response. Responders can block IP addresses of suspicious traffic on the Check Point management servers configured during setup.
User Guide
Workflow Action

The workflow action will show up as ""(Non-IR) Issue a block command of IP: (selected IP here) to configured Check Point system""
The included workflow action allows you to block specific IPs returned when you run a search.
These are global and are therefore available across all apps.
The following workflows are available. Wildcards are used to match any field containing a specific term such as domain:
execute_check_point_block
The user should check their management server to view blocks executed with the workflow action

Known Issue

The workflow action cannot be used in ES Incident Review. The (Non-IR) appearing before the action is meant to bring this greater visibility. 
Unfortunately, there is no way to disable the action from appearing in Incident Review.",Version 2.0.1,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/b92db480-5230-11ec-bd45-6ebf1e056a1a.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,471,0,splunk,0,0,Hurricane Labs,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/hurricanelabs,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

uberAgent consists of two main components: the actual agent runs on the endpoints you want to be monitored, sending the data it collects to the configured backend either directly or via Splunk's Universal Forwarder. The second main component, implemented as a set of Splunk apps, provides dashboards, visualizations, searches, and reports.
The Agent
uberAgent's data collecting component is a lightweight agent that runs independently of any runtimes or frameworks. The agent's footprint is so small that it is truly unobtrusive on the monitored endpoints and does not affect user density.
Where other products rely on operating system sources such as performance counters, WMI, or similar unfiltered data, uberAgent comes with its own metrics. Instead of raw data uberAgent gives you information that matters (see uberAgent's list of metrics).
The agent is highly configurable: metrics can be turned on or off individually, the data collection frequency can be chosen freely, blacklists and whitelists (supporting regular expressions) allow for fine-grained control. This ensures that only data you really need is sent to the backend for indexing.
Browser Extensions
uberAgent's endpoint agent is complemented by browser extensions, which enable uberAgent to collect performance and usage metrics from web apps, too. Extensions are available for all major browsers.
The Splunk Apps
Multiple Splunk apps help process and visualize the data collected by the agent. The indexer app lives on Splunk indexers and mainly creates uberAgent's index and data input. Dashboard apps implement the user interface, providing different views into the collected data. uberAgent comes with two dashboard apps: one for uberAgent UXM and another for uberAgent ESA.
uberAgent's main apps are complemented by special-purpose apps that offer a different view of the existing uberAgent data, such as the uberAgent Helpdesk app.
Most dashboards are searchable and have extensive filtering capabilities to give you a fast and powerful way of isolating specific data. Time range pickers make it easy to go back to the exact time a problem occurred.
uberAgent makes full use of Splunk's advanced UI components to display a beautiful user interface that fluidly adapts to screen width and device type. As a result, it works equally well on a tablet as on a PC or Mac.

Documentation: User Guide
Resilient Web Page: https://www.ibm.com/security/intelligent-orchestration/resilient 
Features


Easy Incident Mapping: Enables mapping of static values or search result tokens into Resilient incident fields. You can map fields parsed from the event in the alert or notable event directly into any incident field. You also have custom incident mapping rules for each saved alert or notable event.


Create Artifacts: Maps result tokens into artifacts at the same time the incident mapping is defined. 


Custom Field Discovery: Retrieves the incident definition from the Resilient platform so that all defined fields and field values are catalogued inside Splunk or Splunk ES. This allows you to add custom fields to the Resilient platform, which are then available for mapping in Splunk or Splunk ES.

Automatic and Manual Escalation: Escalates notable events from a correlation search or alerts from a saved search to Resilient incidents (automatic escalation). For Splunk ES only, you can escalate notable events as an ad hoc action (manual escalation). 

System Requirements

Splunk version 8.0 or later for Python 3 support.
Splunk ES 6.1.0 or later (only if working with Notable Events) for Python 3 support.
Splunk CIM Framework. Note: The Add-On depends on Splunk CIM. Please install CIM before installing the Add-On.
Resilient platform version 35 or later.
Ability to connect directly from Splunk to your Resilient platform with HTTPS on port 443.
A dedicated Resilient Administrator or equivalent account on the Resilient platform. This can be any account that has the permission to create incidents and simulations, and view and modify administrator and customization settings. You need to know the account username and password.
NOTE: Connecting to Resilient with API keys is not supported. You must use an account username and password.
NOTE: Should you later change the dedicated Resilient account to another user, the new user must also have the permission to edit incidents, in addition to the permission to create incidents and simulations and view and modify administrator and customization settings. The edit permission is necessary so that the integration can continue to modify or synchronize the incidents escalated by the original user account.
You can refer to the Playbook Designer Guide for more information about simulations.
Splunk admin role for the user who installs and sets up Resilient Add-On and for all other users that need to add the Add-On as an Alert Action or an Adaptive Response action for a correlation search.

This application template provides visualizations, reports, and searches for Google Cloud Platform data gathered utilizing the Splunk Add-on for Google Cloud Platform, Cloud Functions (see https://github.com/splunk/gcp_functions) or GCP DataFlow Splunk Template. The purpose of this application template is to provide a starting point for various use cases involving GCP data.  Add to, delete from, and modify this template to fit your own requirements.
Correlate other data sources with GCP Data to provide greater Operational or Security Intelligence.
Note - Metrics data can be collected in 3 ways depending on your requirements - GCP Add-On (Event), Cloud Functions (Event or Metrics Store), Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring Add-On.
Each dashboard has the flexibility to allow for different collection and indexing methods. The reason for the need for this flexibility is that the format of the json data collected from PubSub differs between the Add-on and DataFlow - an additional ""data."" prefix layer is present with json content from the Add-On. Also, for performance reasons, it may be beneficial to use indexed extractions for the json content, which will allow for faster searches with tstats - the dashboards can be configured to use either standard and tstats searches. (see below for setup instructions)
Where metrics are required, it is possible to use metrics collected via the Add-On, Cloud functions (into metrics store), or by pulling from Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring using the SIM Add-On.
Pre-requisites / Dependencies:
Install the Google Cloud Platform Add-on for the knowledge objects. https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3088/
Add-Ons / Collection methods
This GCP App supports data to be collected into Splunk via the following methods:
1) Splunk Add-On for Google Cloud Platform (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3088/)
All Data collection methods/sources supported (PubSub, Metrics, GCS)
2) GCP DataFlow. https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/connect-to-splunk-with-a-dataflow-template
All Data collected supported. (pre-install the GCP Add-On, and ensure all sourcetypes for HEC are set to the correct values)
3) Cloud Functions https://github.com/splunk/gcp_functions
All Data collected supported. (pre-install the GCP Add-On, and ensure all sourcetypes for HEC are set to the correct values)
4) Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring Add-on (SIM) https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5247/
All Metrics collected by SIM supported
Follow the instructions for these collection methods before setting up this app.
You will need assets information via Cloud Functions (see https://github.com/splunk/gcp_functions), or by using gcloud command / cron schedule (https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/exporting-to-cloud-storage). For assets data, make sure you use the assets sourcetype below. (additional information is available here - https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/partners/taking-inventory-of-your-google-cloud.html)
Setup / Installation
Macros
The GCP app requires some initial setup of macros to work with your Splunk environment. Set the macro settings according to the tables below:
(Note that the current macro settings for the app can be viewed on the ""setup"" page on the App - if these are blank/empty, you will need to set them to the correct values before the dashboards work)
Splunk Add-On for Google Cloud Platform
If you are collecting the GCP Pub-Sub data via the GCP Add-On, and also collecting metrics via the Add-On, then you will need to set the following :

MacroValue (and default)Description
gcp_indexindex=gcp_indexSets the index where the GCP Data will be stored by the Add-On
datatagaddonAdds ""data."" as a JSON wrapper for PubSub Data
metricstagaddonSets the dashboards to use event based metrics from the Add-On
gcp_metricsindex=gcp_metricsSets the event index where the add-on stores the metrics
gcp_assets_index`gcp_index`Sets the event index where the asset information is stored. Default is set as the value for the gcp_index macro to be backward compatible

(note that if you are collecting metrics via Cloud Functions into Metrics store or using SIM, then the two metrics macros need to be set per the instructions below)
DataFlow
If you are using DataFlow (without transformations) to collect the data from PubSub with no compatibilty settings, then change the following. (note if you use compatibilty, you do not need to change this, and keep as addon):

MacroValueDescription
datatagdataflowThe payload from PubSub isn't ""wrapped"" by ""data."" by default.

SIM / SignalFX
If you are using the SIM / SignalFX (Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring) to collect metrics from GCP, you will need to use and configure connections on the SIM Add-On - https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5247/
Then set the following:

MacroValueDescription
metricstagsimSets the dashboards to use metrics collected from SIM / SignalFX using the Add-On

Cloud Functions
PubSub: Cloud Functions can send data in either Add-On or DataFlow formats - refer to the function documentation for details, and set the macros accordingly.
Metrics: Cloud Functions can send metrics in either Add-On format (event index) or into Metrics Store. If you are collecting metrics into the event index, use the same settings as the Add-On, otherwise if using the metrics store, use the following:

MacroValueDescription
metricstagmetricsSets the dashboards to use metrics store
gcp_metricsindex=gcp_metricsEnsure that this index is a METRICS index not event

Search Performance
If you want to have significantly faster searches using indexed json extractions with tstats, you will need to set the following:
(default is notstats)

MacroValue
tstatstagusetstats

Note also that you will need to apply props.conf and transforms.conf updates to your local GCP-Add-on settings to apply this setting, as it requires indexed extractions. (see below).
Setting this macro (keeping default) to ""notstats"" will use standard searches, but will provide slower ""standard"" search performance, but will not require any changes to your GCP Add-On configuration.
Props/Transforms
If you want to use tstats based searches for faster performance, you will need to apply these changes to your props.conf / transforms.conf in the local directory of the GCP Add-On.
props.conf
[google:gcp:pubsub:message]
INDEXED_EXTRACTIONS = json

Documentation
Detailed documentation can be found at: https://seynur.github.io/DA-ESS-MitreContent/
Overview
This application provides compliance and triage dashboards for MITRE ATT&CK Framework with drill-down capabilities. It is recommended to utilize Splunk Enterprise Security(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/263/) and Splunk ES Content Update (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3449/); however, starting with version 2.3.0 non-ES deployments are also supported with Alert Manager (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2665/) integration.
Required Splunk Apps:
Starting with version 2.3.0, we added support for non-ES (Enterprise Security App) deployments as well.
One of the following applications is required:
- Splunk Enterprise Security 5.2 or above (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/263/)
_OR_


Alert Manager (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2665/)

For one of the views:
- Sankey Diagram - Custom Visualization (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3112/)
Recommended Splunk Apps:

Splunk ES Content Update 1.0.40 or above (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3449/)
Lookup File Editor (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1724/)

Note: Although the app will work without ES Content Update, it is highly recommended since it comes with many correlation rules that have mitre_attack annotations already.
Setup Instructions
After installation of the application you will be on Setup page.  Review your desired configuration for scheduled searches and simply hit Save to continue.  Default view will be the Compliance Dashboard.  If the matrix is not populated, click on the table to run manually, which will direct you to the Lookup Generation dashboard (searches run automatically on that dashboard).
Note: If using Alert Manager app, you will need to uncheck Use Enterprise Security App checkbox within Setup view.
Saved Searches
This application comes with predefined saved searches.  Lookup Gen searches are scheduled to run  daily after midnight.  The main ones that are used by views:
- MITRE ATT&CK All Rules and Techniques Lookup Gen: This lookup generator checks currently enabled correlation rules via analytic stories and combines the searches with user-defined mitre_user_rule_technique_lookup.csv file that matches MITRE ATT&CK technique IDs with rules.
- MITRE ATT&CK Compliance Lookup Gen: This lookup generator relies on mitre_all_rule_technique_lookup.csv in order to generate a new lookup to properly display MITRE ATT&CK Compliance martix.

CIM
Qumulo Splunk App defines three source types:
[qumulo://get_iops]
[qumulo://get_capacity]
[qumulo://get_throughput]
Distributed deployment
This app is designed to run in context of a Splunk server and communicates via REST 
with a Qumulo cluster.
Additional declarations
Using
Clicking on 'Qumulo App' on the left-hand side in the Splunk home screen brings you to the default / provided 
Qumulo dashboard.  It can be customized as-needed.  By default it shows:
Minimum and Average Free Capacity  charts
Read and Write Throughput values over time
Most Active Client IPs against the cluster, over time
These are suggested metrics to display in the dashboard.  By clicking on the Qumulo Splunk App icon, you can search
any of the Qumulo metrics and create appropriate dashboard components or alerts or replace the existing dashboard 
components.
Clicking on 'Search' in the Qumulo Splunk App navigation bar will let you search on any one of IOPs, capacity or
throughput.  
Clicking on 'Setup' in the Qumulo Splunk App navigation bar will let you set up or edit parameters for the app,
enable or disable endpoints, control polling frequency for each of the three REST inputs or view any errors
that have occurred within the Qumulo Splunk App.
Logging
Any log entries/errors will get written to $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log
Troubleshooting
Clicking on 'Manage/ Qumulo Splunk App Errors' in the Qumulo Splunk App navigation bar will show any errors that
have occurred while running the Qumulo Splunk App; Errors can be queried and filtered just like any other data in
Spllunk.

Splunk versions:
Splunk 4.0 and higher
Platforms:
Windows Vista, 7, 2008 with Powershell 1.0 installed
SCOM versions:
Tested on SCOM 2007 R2 and later. The add-on has no known dependencies on R2, so it should work with R1. The legacy MOM environment is not supported.
We recommend that the add-on be installed on the SCOM root server.
Powershell requirements
Powershell 1.0 must be installed and the SCOM Powershell snap-in must be registered. Registration happens automatically when the SCOM operations console is installed.
NOTE: By default Powershell has a security policy enabled that restricts execution of user scripts from the command line. To overcome this, we change the execution policy to the less restricted RemoteSigned mode each time the Powershell script is called. See http://ss64.com/ps/set-executionpolicy.html for more information.
Support
This add-on is community suported. This means that there's no formal support from Splunk available for this add-on, but free support is available on Splunk Answers and questions, bug reports, and feature requests will be addressed on a best-effort basis by the add-on's author or other community members.

Installation

Install Splunk if it's not already installed. 
Using the download button on this page, download and save the scom.tar.gz file. 
Decompress the add-on (it's compressed in .tar.gz format so you'll need a tool like 7Zip to decompress) and place the extracted scom folder into %PROGRAMFILES%\Splunk\etc\apps
Start or restart your Splunk instance (you can use the splunk restart command or the GUI)
Navigate to the Splunk GUI (usually http://localhost:8000/) and log in if needed
Select Manage Apps from the App menu, OR go to Manager>Apps.
Open Splunk Add-on For SCOM.
Fill in the user settings on the add-on's setup page.

Configuration
The add-on provides a setup page to configure SCOM-specific settings like SCOM hostname, polling interval, and inputs. This info is then written to bin\scom_client.xml. The powershell scripted input reads its configuration from this file each time it starts up.
You can select whether to enable or disable forwarding for all events and/or alerts from the SCOM database. If the checkbox is selected, the script will request all events/alerts starting with the very first event/alert and forward those to Splunk. When the script reaches the most recent event/alert, it will switch to polling mode; in polling mode, the script waits for new events/alerts and forwards them as soon as they become available. No events/alerts filtering is available through the setup screen-- you can either get all events/alerts or none.
How it works

SCOM -> Splunk event and alert data forwarding is done using two PowerShell comandlets, which are part of OpsMgr Powershell library (""Snap-in"") that ships with the OpsMgr. Once executed in the Powershell environment, these comandlets (Get-Alert and Get-Event) print out events and alerts to the console. 
We implement a powershell script scom_client.ps1 that:
Imports the SCOM snap-in
Reads config data (SCOM hostname, selected type of input(alerts and/or events) and SCOM polling interval)
Establishes a connection with local or remote SCOM server
Enters a loop polling SCOM for events starting with the latest imported event
Formats the output to look more Splunk-friendly and prints it to the console


The script keeps track of the timestamp and GUID of the last event forwarded by saving this information to a file. If the script is stopped or interrupted, it will resume indexing from where it was when it got interrupted.

Performance
Our tests showed a throughput of about 3,000 events/min on a Xeon 3Ghz/4Gb Win2008 with full SCOM and Splunk installed at the same machine. The Powershell client process consumed around 3Gb of RAM while 800,000 events were being forwarded; the average CPU usage was 25%.
Remote execution
As mentioned above, we recommend that the add-on be executed on the same box as the SCOM root server. If you do need to run it remotely:

The add-on can only run on Windows Vista, 7, or 2008, with Powershell 1.0 installed.
If you want to run it remotely, it's recommended that the SCOM operations console be installed on the remote box to make sure the Powershell snap-in is registered in GAC. Alternatively, a few steps need to be taken as described here: http://derekhar.blogspot.com/2007/07/operation-manager-command-shell-on-any.html
You need to add the user account under which the script will be running to the SCOM Administrators list. To do this, in the SCOM management console go to Administration -> Security / User Roles, right-click on Operations Manager Administrators, and select Properties. Click Add and select the group that the remote user belongs to.

Field names
Mapping of SCOM field names to Splunk field names is hardcoded in the scom_client.ps1 script, but can be easily modified as needed in that script.
Below is the full field mapping for alerts:

Login PI is an advanced performance measuring system that employs virtual users to monitor your end-users’ actual digital experience. But unlike real-user / synthetic monitoring, Login PI’s virtual users simulate real end-user desktop tasks—in a consistent and measurable fashion—providing you with an accurate picture of desktop performance without affecting end-user productivity.
You can now gain access to this data programmatically. Our secure API lets you integrate Login PI’s virtual user data into other popular third-party tools, such as Splunk, where it can be tracked and analyzed—ultimately providing you with predictive digital user experience analytics. 
There are lots of ways you can use our API, for example: 
•    Login PI data could be fed to a Splunk Predictive Analytics dashboard where it could drive insight into future VDI capacity planning needs
•   Login PI alerts could automatically generate helpdesk trouble tickets before end-users even notice there’s a problem
•   Write an Excel macro that calls on our API to return a set of performance results to create charts and graphs for BI reporting

Splunk 6.4, 6.5, 6.6
Installation

Install the app on your Splunk Search Head(s).
Get a google API key from Google API Key
Write the API_Key in the setup page.
Restart Splunk Search Head.

Usage
  your splunk query|printgeocode type=geocode address=Address_field
Geocoding returns three new fields: geolocation_status, geolocation_lat and geolocation_lon
OR 
   your splunk query|printgeocode type=reverse latfield=latfieldname lonfield=lonfieldname
Reverse Geocoding returns two new fields: geolocation_status and geolocation_addr
Where type=geocoding tells the app that it is geocoding and type=reverse indicates that it is Reverse Geocoding
Address_field is the name of the text field in your data which contains a valid address. latfieldname and lonfieldname are fields    containing values of latitude and longitudes of an geopoint respectively.
The output fields are prefixed with keyword geolocation.

Example-1 Geocoding: Address to latitude,longitude

    index=test sourcetype=""users_addresses"" 
    | head 2
    | table first_name last_name address city country Address 
    | printgeocode type=geocode address=Address


Use map with latitude,longitude from the output of the command

    index=test sourcetype=""users_addresses"" 
    | head 2
    | table first_name last_name address city country Address
    | printgeocode type=geocode address=Address
    | geostats count latfield=geolocation_lat longfield=geolocation_lon 


Example-2 Reverse Geocoding: latitude,longitude to Address

    index=test sourcetype=""user_latlon"" 
    | head 5
    | table policyID line county point_latitude point_longitude 
    | printgeocode type=reverse latfield=point_latitude lonfield=point_longitude 

As simple as looking for a location on Maps :)
Handling of API key
The Google API Key entered on the setup page is stored as password in encrypted format at Rest Endpoint path: 
 https://<SPLUNK_SEARCH_HEAD_URL>:8089/servicesNS/nobody/GoogleGeoCode/storage/passwords 

The password is retrieved, decrypted and then the API is invoked. It is stored at $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/GoogleGeoCode/local/passwords.conf
    [credential::Test Server Key:]
    password = $1$DLLZaK+SYHMnEAonrZi7vpuOEpJUXvi3cX3mV1fonSgdiiz3ZR2BHg==
Troubleshooting


The field geolocation_status is an indicator of the status from Google's Geolocation API. If everything is okay (input, quota of API key and Internet connection), the status will be ""OK"". Below are some of the status returned by Google's API-

""OK"" indicates that no errors occurred; the address was successfully parsed and at least one geocode was returned.
""ZERO_RESULTS"" indicates that the geocode was successful but returned no results. This may occur if the geocoder was passed a non-existent address.
""OVER_QUERY_LIMIT"" indicates that you are over your quota.
""REQUEST_DENIED"" indicates that your request was denied.
""INVALID_REQUEST"" generally indicates that the query (address, components or latlng) is missing.
""UNKNOWN_ERROR"" indicates that the request could not be processed due to a server error. The request may succeed if you try again.



If you get an error ""OVER_QUERY_LIMIT"", you can try below options -


Option1: Get a new Key and put that value in myconfig.py. Restart Splunk search head, the results should be good.


Option 2: Wait for midnight PST timezone for the limit to rest :)


When you run the command, the information is logged into $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/googlegeocode.log


    2018-05-02 14:10:35,167 INFO In Reverse Geocode function
    2018-05-02 14:10:37,578 INFO Status from Google GeoCoding API is OK

References
The app uses the Google's Geocoding API. Here's the link to their documentation
Geocoding is the process of converting addresses (like ""1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA"") into geographic coordinates (like latitude 37.423021 and longitude -122.083739), which you can use to place markers on a map, or position the map.
Reverse geocoding is the process of converting geographic coordinates into a human-readable address.
The Google Maps Geocoding API provides a direct way to access these services via an HTTP request. The following example uses the Geocoding service through the Google Maps JavaScript API to demonstrate the basic functionality.

When it sits on a corporate network, it functions similar to servers and desktops. Therefore they are equally vulnerable to cyber-attack like those that target at servers and desktops. However, many security solutions focus more on servers and desktops. Printers and MFPs are often neglected or not sufficiently protected. While the plethora of security advices are available to harden these devices, there is no real holistic solution to monitor or detect security events emitted from them in real-time.This Splunk app is therefore developed to ingest HP printer logs in real-time and monitor, detect and report critical security events through log analysis.",Version 1.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/856a1ca6-3a11-11e7-9326-02f13bdc2585.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,488,0,splunk,5,1,NYP SIT,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/nypsit,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

Internal Billing App provides means to monitor how the various client teams using your Splunk platform consume their license allowed quota.
To do so, Internal Billing App lets you map your Splunk indexes to their client team owner and assign each client team a daily license quota.
The provided insights aim at helping you follow your client team’s license consumption on your platform.
Version 1.0.4

Insight
Internal Billing App shares the same purpose as the Chargeback Analysis for Splunk App (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2967/).
We just had to build our simple version for a specific use case and wanted to share it on Splunkbase.
The App has two external dependencies.
It uses Luke Murphey's great Lookup File Editor (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1724/) to ease lookup building.
It also uses Discovered Intelligence's Meta Woot! (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2949/).
This later App provides great insights from your Splunk metadata and license usage.
To build its knowledge on your license consumption, it uses a dedicated accelerated Data Model.
The Meta Woot License Usage Data Model aggregates data from your license_usage.log file ingested in the _internal index.
We thought it was more convenient to use this Data Model because we do use Meta Woot and wanted to avoid having to maintain a duplicate data model and because we are planning to release another App also based on this Data Model.
Prerequisites
1 - Deploy Lookup File Editor (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1724/) on your Splunk Search Head.
2 - Deploy Meta Woot! (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2949/) on your Splunk Search Head.
3 - Configure acceleration for Meta Woot's License Usage Data Model.
It can be achieved by ticking Accelerate from Settings > Data models > Meta Woot License Usage > Edit > Edit Acceleration and by setting the Summary Range to 7 days.
4 - Configure global permissions for Meta Woot's License Usage Data Model to be able to access the aggregated data outside of Meta Woot!.
This can be done by selecting 'Display For All apps' from Settings > Data models > Meta Woot License Usage > Edit > Edit Permissions and by making sure to at least set read permissions for the role that will be used to launch the App.
5 - Configure the '_internal' index as an allowed index for your role. As Meta Woot's License Usage Data Model gathers data from the '_internal' index, your role should be able to query this index.
It can be set by adding '_internal' index to the allowed indexes attached to Settings > Access controls > Roles > [Your role].
6 - In a distributed environment, make sure internal data from your License Master is being indexed on your Indexers and therefore available from your Search Head(s).
You should retrieve results from the following query: index=""_internal"" sourcetype=""splunkd"" source=""*license_usage.log"" type=""Usage""
7 - If deployed on an earlier version of Splunk (pre 7.1) add 'color=""#333333""' to the first line of the default navigation menu (Settings > User interface > Navigation menus > default).
Configuration Steps
App deployment
Deploy the App on your Search Head.
Populate indexes_mapped_to_teams_lookup
This lookup maintains a mapping between indexes and their owners, the client teams.
This lookup consists in a simple index -> team association.
To help you build this lookup you can use dedicated savedsearches available from Internal Billing UI > Configure > Lookup bases and alerts.
From there, pick ""Generate initial empty lookups"" and choose ""Open in Search"".
This will build generate empty csv files for all needed lookups.
Then, pick ""Generate lookup base to map teams to indexes"" and choose ""Open in Search"".
This will build a list of your indexes (those filled yesterday) and associate them with a temporary ""TBD"" team, and save a lookup file named 'indexes_mapped_to_teams_lookup_base.csv'.
This base lookup can be accessed App's UI > Configure > Map indexes to teams (base lookup) where it can be manually populated with proper teams.
Once done, export the result from Lookup Editor UI.
Then, the exported base lookup can be imported into the actual lookup from App's UI > Configure > Map indexes to teams.
Finally, you should be able to browse the lookup you have just updated by browsing it through a dedicated view reachable from the App's UI > Browse > Mapped indexes.
If your organization has a CMDB you can pull data from, you can alternatively automate this whole process and thus maintain an automatically updated version of the lookup.
Populate quotas_assigned_to_teams_lookup
This lookup maintains a mapping between teams and their allowed license quota.
This lookup consists in a simple team -> quota association.
It also lets you associate a team with its contact.
To help you build this lookup you can use a dedicated savedsearch available from Internal Billing UI > Configure > Lookup bases and alerts.
From there, pick ""Generate lookup base to attribute quotas to teams"" and choose ""Open in Search"".
This will build a list of your teams from the previously configured lookup and associate them with a temporary ""TBD"" quota, and save a lookup file named 'quotas_assigned_to_teams_base.csv'.
This base lookup can be accessed App's UI > Configure > Assign quotas to teams (base lookup) where it can be manually filled with agreed quotas.
Once done, export the result from Lookup Editor UI.
Then, the exported base lookup can be imported into the actual lookup from App's UI > Configure > Assign quotas to teams.
Finally, you should be able to browse the lookup you have just updated by browsing it through a dedicated view reachable from the App's UI > Browse > Assigned quotas.
Validate your lookups using Inspect view.
From the App's UI > Inspect, you can use the configured panels to validate your lookups.
The provided queries will look for indexes mapped to multiple teams, unlisted indexes or teams, and undefined quotas.
These queries are also available as alerts which can be enabled from App's UI > Configure > Lookup bases and alerts
Use the App
Once ready to use, Monitor and Investigate are the two main dashboards to visit.
Monitor provides data on license consumption by team on the last 3 days.
Drilldown capabilities let you sharpen a particular team's consumption to the index, sourcetype and host levels.
Whenever you need an historical trend, the Investigate dashboard can help.
The Investigate dashboard also provide drilldown capabilities that will let you expand an initial result.
Alerts
Several alerts are included in this App.
Whenever a team exceeds its daily-allowed license quota, the 'Exceeded quota' alert is triggered.
Other alerts have been converted from the Inspect dashboard queries.
All alerts have been disabled by default. Adjust and enable them as preferred.
Additional notes
Note that most of the queries configured in this App are querying the summarized data (summariesonly=true).
Hence, if you need to be able to query data older than the configured Summary Range for the Data Model (i.e. 7 days), you need either to extend the Summary Range or adapt the searches to not only look for summarized data.
The latter option can be achieved with summariesonly=false clause instead of summariesonly=true in queries.
Note that we designed this App to map teams to indexes. Depending on your context, you might rather need to map your client teams with sourcetypes or even with hosts.

jsonutils provides a pair of commands for extracting fields from json data in _raw. jsonkv is smaller and faster, will use less memory and may work on incomplete or invalid json. jsonkvrecursive will parse the json and create a field for every value, including arrays, but will only work on valid json.
jsonkv
jsonkv uses regular expressions to pull field values from a given json.
Examples:
Given this json:  
{
  ""glossary"": {
    ""title"":""example glossary"",
    ""ID"":""SGML"",
    ""SortAs"":""SGML"",
    ""GlossTerm"":""Standard Generalized Markup Language"",

      ""para"":""A meta-markup language, used to create markup languages such as DocBook.""
    },
    ""GlossSee"":""markup""
  }
}

jsonkv
will extract the following fields:
title=""example glossary""

For more information about this solution refer to the Cisco Endpoint Security Analytics for Splunk (CESA) home page.

GETTING STARTED
Cisco Endpoint Security Analytics for Splunk (CESA) consists of 3 components:

The Splunk App - 2992 with pre-designed Dashboards to visualize and view the data.
The Splunk Add-on - 4221 which provides data indexing and formatting inside Splunk Enterprise.
The CESA Collector Component which is responsible for collecting and translating all IPFIX (nvzFlow) data from the endpoints and forwarding it to the Splunk Add-on.  This is a manually installed component that requires 64-bit Linux (see NVM COLLECTOR COMPONENT INSTALLATION section for more information).


DEPLOYMENT OVERVIEW
Below is a high level overview of a deployment in its simplest form.
This would be an all-in-one configuration running on 64-bit Linux. 
This configuration is how most demonstrations will be setup and is also useful in a small production deployment.

Below is a more comprehensive set of options that are available for deployment.
Typically a production setup will be distributed and have several Splunk Enterprise nodes.


SPLUNK APPLICATION & ADD-ON INSTALLATION
The Application should be installed on the Search Head or Indexer, either through the UI via “Manage Apps” or by extracting the archive into /opt/splunk/etc/apps folder.  
The Splunk Add-on should be installed following the Splunk Best Practices Instructions for Add-ons
Please restart the Spunk Server after installation of both components is completed.
You can confirm that both components are properly installed by viewing them in ""Manage Apps""

After completing this step, refer to the NVM collector installation section below.  The collector must be running before data will be available to the Splunk components.
The default configuration receives three data feeds for Splunk, Per Flow Data, Endpoint System Data and Endpoint Interface Data, on UDP ports 20519, 20520 and 20521 respectively.  This can be changed in the Application Input settings in Splunk if for some reason you needed to change the collector configuration as described below.
The Add-On maps these to Splunk sourcetypes cisco:nvm:flowdata, cisco:nvm:sysdata and cisco:nvm:ifdata.
NOTE: Because sourcetypes have changed older data generated from version 1.x will not map to the UI dashboards.

NVM COLLECTOR COMPONENT INSTALLATION
The NVM collector runs on 64-bit Linux.  CentOS, Ubuntu and Docker configuration scripts are included.  The CentOS install scripts and configuration files can also be used in Fedora and Redhat distributions.
In a typical distrubuted Splunk Enterprise deployment, the collector should be run on either a standalone 64-bit Linux system or a Splunk Forwarder node running on 64-bit Linux.
NOTE: The solution can also be run on a single 64-bit Linux system that includes the NVM collector and Splunk Enterprise components for use in a small deployment or for demonstration purposes.
In order to install the collector you will need to copy the application in the acnvmcollector.zip file, located in the [YOUR_SPLUNK_SERVER]/$APP_DIR$/appserver/addon/ directory to the system you plan to install it on. 
Extract the files on the system where you plan to install the collector on and execute the install.sh script with super user privileges.  It is recommended to read the $PLATFORM$_README file in the .zip bundle before executing the install.sh script.  The $PLATFORM$_README file provides information on the relevant configuration settings that need to be verified and modified (if necessary) before the install.sh script is executed.  At a minimum, you will need to configure the address of the Splunk instance you will be forwarding data to.  Failing to properly configure the system can cause the collector to operate incorrectly.
NOTE: Ensure that network and host firewalls are properly configured to allow the UDP traffic for the source and destination addresses and ports
A single NVM collector instance can handle a minimum of 5000 flows per second on a properly sized system.
The collector needs to be configured and running before the Splunk App can be used.
By default, the collector receives flows from AnyConnect NVM endpoints on UDP port 2055.
Additionally, the collector produces three data feeds for Splunk,  Per Flow Data,  Endpoint System Data and  Endpoint Interface Data, on UDP ports 20519, 20520 and 20521 respectively.
The receive and data feed ports can be changed by altering the acnvm.conf file and restarting the collector instance.  Make sure that any host/network firewalls between endpoints and the collector or between the collector and Splunk system(s) are open for the configured UDP ports and addresses.  Also ensure that your AnyConnect NVM configuration matches your collector configuration.  Refer to the AnyConnect Administration Guide for more information.
Once all components are installed and running, refer to the Help files section from within the Splunk application for detailed information about the pre-configured reports, data model and information elements that are created by the solution.
You may want to restart one of your AnyConnect endpoints and validate that data is being sent to the solution.
Some additional information is available at this Cisco Community Site that you might find useful.

While PORA is the companion app for Playbooks-On-Rails for Splunk (PORS) it can be used for ""just"" Ansible visualization as well (i.e. without PORS).
PORS is a collection of Ansible playbooks, roles & tasks for installing, configuring & managing your whole Splunk infrastructure - including Apps using the Splunk deployment process. But the icing on the cake is that PORS comes with a terminal UI that does all this with the snap of a finger!
PORA details
Features:

useful insights of (any) Ansible playbook runs (executed manually or by PORS)
alerting for failed Ansible playbook runs (predefined)
alerting for anything else you want - related to Ansible playbooks ;)
visualize any Ansible playbook run - even when just using Ansible without PORS

Twilio App for Splunk helps you ingest Twilio logs into Splunk. This app comes prebuilt with searches powering a number of dashboards and alerts for the ingested log data. It also provides Twilio SMS alerting functionality via Splunk's scripted alert triggers.
What's included
1 x Index (twilio)
4 x Prebuilt Dashboards (call center, call stats, sms center, billing)
*1 x Prebuilt Alert (billing)
Installation
Download this app from Splunkbase then upload the tar.gz file to Splunk.
Log Input Config
1) Download your Twilio call and SMS logs
Twilio provides an easy way to access your call and SMS logs using the web interface.
Download your Twilio call logs here.
Download your Twilio SMS logs here.
Protip: Place both files in a folder together.
2) Upload these files to Splunk
Navigate to: Settings > Data inputs > Files & directories
Click add new.
Follow the steps, making sure you set sourcetype=csv, and index=twilio.
You can choose wether to monitor a file or a directory. Protip: If you placed both files in the same directory during step one, it is quicker to provide Splunk with the directory to monitor. This way, if new Twilio logs are added in the future, Splunk will automatically ingest them.
3) Profit
If everything has worked well, a simple search for ""index=twilio"" should return some results. You might need to restart Splunk first.
Splunk SMS Alert Setup
0) Overview
1) Get your Twilio account keys
Get your Twilio Account SID and Auth Token on your Twilio Dashboard
2) Edit alert scripts
Go to ""$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/twilio-app/bin""
Using your favourite text editor open ""$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/twilio-app/bin/textalert-twilio.py""
Enter your Twilio Account SID (starting with AC) / Auth token
Enter ""TO phone number"" (recipient of SMS Text Message)
*Enter ""FROM phone number"" (sender of message, must be one of your Twilio Account phone #)
3) Configure an alert
Configure a Splunk alert and select the ""Run a Script"" option.
Set ""textalert-twilio.py"" as the script
Note: Twilio will charge you for every SMS message sent. You can view Twilio pricing @ https://www.twilio.com/sms/pricing
4) Profit
If everything has worked well the ""TO phone number"" should be recieving alerts. If not, check the alerts are being fired in the alert manager in the Splunk GUI via: ""Activity"" > ""Alert Manager""
Upcoming features
*Automated (real-time) collection of logs into Splunk via Twilio API.

Overview
The Hunk App for HBase is a Streaming External Results Provider enabling import of data from HBase. This application will perform a scan on a HBase table and stream the data to Hunk for analysis. The data returned from HBase is streamed as JSON documents, one document per row.
HBase Version
This release of the Hunk App for HBase has been compiled and tested with HBase 1.1.2. For other versions please contact us. 
Configuration
Provider Configuration
The Hunk App for HBase provides the usual Hunk ERP parameters:
vix.mode = stream
vix.command =  java
vix.command.arg.1 = -Xmx512m
vix.command.arg.2 = -classpath
vix.command.arg.3 = $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/jars/SplunkMR-h1.jar:$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/hbase-erp/bin/hbase-erp-1.0.0.jar:$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/hbase-erp/bin/lib/*
vix.command.arg.4 = com.splunk.erp.hbase.HBaseERP
vix.splunk.search.debug = 0
Additionally you can set HBase-specific parameters using vix.<name> = <value>
e.g.
vix.hbase.zookeeper.quorum = localhost
vix.zookeeper.znode.parent = /hbase-unsecure
Examples of these have already been set in the provided indexes.conf.
Finally, you can change the log level with vix.loglevel and one of these threshold values: ALL, TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL or OFF.
Virtual Index Configuration
To customize the index, you need at a minimum to provide the following parameters:
 vix.hbase.table: the table you want to scan
 vix.hbase.family: the column family to include in the scan
There are some optional settings you can also provide:
 vix.hbase.column.<name>: data type for a column (bigdecimal, boolean, double, float, integer, long, short, string). If not specified the default data type is string
 vix.hbase.datetime.column: name of the HBase column that contains the event time in Splunk
 vix.hbase.datetime.format: timestamp format
 vix.hbase.max.days.hence: maximum number of days in the future from the current date that an extracted date can be valid
These can be set in the Hunk UI (Settings > Virtual indexes > Virtual Indexes > Index), or in the indexes.conf file.
If the vix.hbase.datetime.column is left blank, there will be no event time. Hunk does try to infer the event time from the data, so if your data has dates, Hunk may use that as the event time.
Similarly if you do not specify the vix.hbase.datetime.format, Hunk will try to infer it. If you do have vix.hbase.datetime.column set, setting vix.hbase.datetime.format will result in better performance.
For more information about the Hunk date format see this documentation page
If you do not set vix.hbase.max.days.hence events that occur in the future may be rolled up to an event time of today (or this month). The data will still be present, but the inferred event date will be incorrect.
You can create multiple Virtual Indices for the same Provider (and, thus, the same HBase client connection) by clicking the New Virtual Index button.  Make sure to select the proper Provider (e.g., the hbase provider that comes with this application).
Searching HBase through Hunk
To search a virtual index in Hunk type index=<virtual index name> in the search box, e.g. index=mytable.
You can use any pipe command just like you would normally do with Hunk, e.g. index=mytable | top limit=20 date",Version 1.0.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/c01f1848-fddf-11e5-8ccd-06caea5ac9f9.png,"IT Operations, Business Analytics",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,281,0,splunk,5,1,Julien Ruaux,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/jruaux_splunk,"Products: Splunk Enterprise

OVERVIEW
QSentry is a consumable feed of anonymization and threat actor IP addresses sourced from the Deep and DarkWeb and Qintel’s proprietary research. The IPs in the feed are associated with infrastructure actively utilized or abused by cyber criminals, including VPN/Proxy services and IP addresses linked to the malicious infrastructure of criminal and nation-state actors. With this integration, users can fetch a daily list of newly compiled indicators from QSentry’s collections.
The Qintel QSentry Feed Add-on for Splunk allows you to ingest the Qintel QSentry feed into a key value store in Splunk so that your logs data can be enriched automatically or at search time.

This App uses Node.js to collect web performance data (Web Timing metrics) beaconed from real end users using boomerang.js (a client-side JavaScript library developed by Yahoo!). The data sent by Boomerang to Node is written to /var/log/rum.log by default.
Download & install Node.js. See: http://nodejs.org/download/

Test your Node installation.
node $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/webperf/bin/node/test.js
Server running at http://127.0.0.1:7000

Hit http://127.0.0.1:7000 in your browser. Open ports as necessary.
Start the Node server to receive and log performance data from boomerang.js
sudo node $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/webperf/bin/node/server.js
Server running at http://127.0.0.1:7000

Note: You must run server.js as root or someone with privledges to write to /var/log/
Add boomerang.js to the pages you'd like to monitor:
BOOMR.init({
  beacon_url: 'http://node.mydomain.com:7000',
  site_domain: ""example.com"", 
  user_ip: ""{Client IP Address"",
  BW: { enabled: true,
    base_url: ""http://base_url/to/bandwidth/images/"",
  }
});

See: $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/webperf/examples/example.html for a working example (View Soruce)
That's it! Data sent by boomerang.js should now be flowing into Splunk. Tail /var/log/rum.log to verify that you are receiving data.

Generating Sample Data:
To generate fake sample data, similar to that beaconed back by boomarang (that's a mouth full), use the data_gen.js node script.
node $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/webperf/bin/node/data_gen.js
Note: This will create ~1 event/second for example.com until it reaches 1,000 events.


Boomerang Beacon Parameters:
The beacon that sent to your server will contain several parameters. Each boomerang plugin also adds its own set of parameters.
Default boomerang parameters

v : Version number of the boomerang library in use.
u : URL of page that sends the beacon.

Roundtrip plugin parameters

t_done [optional] Perceived load time of the page.
t_page [optional] Time taken from the head of the page to page_ready.
t_resp [optional] Time taken from the user initiating the request to the first byte of the response.
t_other [optional] Comma separated list of additional timers set by page developer. Each timer is of the format name|value. The following timers may be included:
t_load [optional] If the page were prerendered, this is the time to fetch and prerender the page.
t_prerender : [optional] If the page were prerendered, this is the time from start of prefetch to the actual page display. It may only be useful for debugging.
t_postrender [optional] If the page were prerendered, this is the time from prerender finish to actual page display. It may only be useful for debugging.
boomerang = The time it took boomerang to load up from first byte to last byte
boomr_fb [optional The time it took from the start of page load to the first byte of boomerang. Only included if we know when page load started.
r URL of page that set the start time of the beacon.
r2 = [optional] URL of referrer of current page. Only set if different from r and strict_referrer has been explicitly turned off.
rt.start =  Specifies where the start time came from. May be one of cookie for the start cookie, navigation for the W3C navigation timing API, csi for older versions of Chrome or gtb for the Google Toolbar.
rt.bstart = The timestamp when boomerang showed up on the page
rt.end = The timestamp when the done() method was called

Bandwidth & latency plugin

bw = User's measured bandwidth in bytes per second
bw_err = 95% confidence interval margin of error in measuring user's bandwidth
lat  = User's measured HTTP latency in milliseconds
lat_err = 95% confidence interval margin of error in measuring user's latency
bw_time = Timestamp (seconds since the epoch) on the user's browser when the bandwidth and latency was measured

With this application a Spunk owner can dispose of the analysis results done by Optimis directly in his Splunk implementation to :
View builtin reports of selected analysis corresponding to a measurement done from a specific context point by the OptimIS solution :
-TCP / UDP Transactions: displays the statistics of TCP exchanges.
-HTTP Transactions: displays HTTP transactions along with the various error codes and response times per transaction.
-802.11 Activity: displays the statistics of radio exchanges between stations and wifi hotspots.
Enrich data at disposal of a Splunk implementation to consolidate information and permit best decisions making
The source data is collected from on-premises infrastructure network by the Optimis system at various probe locations. Then they are analyzed and aggregated before being sent to the Splunk infrastructure for indexing and presentation by Optimis for Splunk.
Splunk Enterprise
When using Splunk Enterprise, you can install the OptimIS for Splunk app from the Splunkbase. If you don’t have directly access to Splunkbase, you can also install the OptimIS for Splunk app as follows:
    cd SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/
    wget .../optimis.tar.gz
    tar -xzf optimis.tar.gz
    $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk restart

The path of Splunk must be defined as an environment variable.
Setup after installation App on Splunk Enterprise:
1.The OptimIS appliance send data to Splunk indexer over TCP 4444 port using Universal Splunk Forwarder. To configure this input data, please create the file $ SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ Optimis/local/inputs.conf and add the following lines to it:
[splunktcp://4444]
disabled = 0
connection_host = ip

2.The ""Optimis for splunk"" application expects the index of events sent from the Optimis appliance to be set to ""optimis"". This index is used to optimize the data search performance for this application, please add a new index named ""optimis"" associated to “Optimis for Splunk” application in your Splunk configuration by creating the $SPLUNK_ROOT/etc/apps/Optimis /local/indexes.conf file, and adding the following lines to it: 
[optimis] 
coldPath = $SPLUNK_DB/optimis/colddb
homePath = $SPLUNK_DB/optimis/db
thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/optimis/thaweddb

3.Restart splunk for the configuration changes to take effect
Splunk indexer is now listening for data from OptimIS appliance on port 4444.

Quickly see all calls matching any search filters.
Drilldown at any time to thoroughly investigate a particular call.
Click your way to pretty much any report over any combination of fields.

That third bullet sounds a little crazy - what about some examples?
You can:

create reports around concurrent calls and dropped calls.
create a chart of usage stats about your hunt groups.
see and share inbound/outbound call stats by agent or department.
create custom call quality reports and dashboards (MOS, jitter, latency, packet loss).
build utilization reports by device, device_type, sites, buildings, you name it.
drilldown at any time from any report, to inspect and sanity check the calls themselves.
but really, pretty much anything. Try it and see.

What are these, reports? dashboards? alerts?
Yes. For any of those use cases (and any you can dream up), you can:

create graphs, charts, tables, and even mapping visualizations of various kinds and package them into dashboards if you like.
set up alerting around anything - dropped calls, quality, volume thresholds.
share any and all of the above as dashboards with different teams and colleagues.
automate dashboards you created, to send pdf’s of themselves out every day/week.

What about my report that I don't see listed here?
Contact us and we'll help you learn how to create what you need for your own “somewhat unusual” CallManager deployment. There are over 200 fields (Check them out here). If you can in principle calculate the thing you need from some number of those fields, in some product or by hand, then we can show how to make the app do it.
Can I try it out?
Yes you can download the app from Splunkbase or from this site, and you can get a 90 day trial license string from this site. You can set the whole thing up yourself with your own live data, in about 30 minutes. See our installation and setup docs here.
Pricing
The app is priced by the size of your CallManager deployment - specifically the total number of User Licenses and Unassigned Device Licenses that are in use, in CallManager itself. At and below 400 such licenses in use, the cost is only $1,200 per year, but we have a range of customers at all scales from below 100 to above 50,000 licenses in use. Send us a screenshot of the total licenses in use from PLM, or a screenshot per cluster of the ""License Usage Report"" in CM Admin and we can let you know the exact cost.
Splunk Enterprise - do I need it?
Yes. The majority of our prospects are already Splunk Enterprise customers, and if this is you, this app will likely add only a negligible additional load to ingest the CallManager data that it needs. If you're not, Sideview is also a Splunk Reseller in North America so we can help you on that side.
How about Splunk Cloud?
Yes the app is vetted for Splunk Cloud. We do recommend that you contact us before proceeding though.
What versions of CUCM are supported?
CUCM 7.0 up to the current release 12.X
What are the actual data sources that it uses?

CUCM CDR - through Callmanager's own ""external billing server"" mechanism, CUCM will basically SFTP this data right to Splunk. See our install docs for full steps. 
CUCM CMR - these are the call quality records, and they come in via the same mechanism
CUBE CDR - This is an optional secondary data source.  see docs for more details
Syslog - Although the App's UI does not currently integrate anything from the syslog events yet, we do have documentation on how to pull them in.

However if the data you're hoping to work with isn't in that list, Feel free to contact us anyway!.",Version 6.2.2,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/85580642-7003-11ec-973b-e6c1b0396c73.png,IT Operations,https://sideviewapps.com/sideview-trial-internal-use-license-agreement/,"8,451",0,splunk,5,14,Sideview LLC,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/sideview_llc,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

This empowers security teams with a complete view of their external threat landscape and ensures their cybersecurity posture is robust, resilient, and able to counter emerging cyber threats. 
CYFIRMA’s core platform, DeCYFIR, gives security leaders a unified view into six threat pillars – attack surface discovery, vulnerability intelligence, brand intelligence, digital risk discovery, situational awareness, and cyber-intelligence. Based on analysis of threat indicators collected from the deep web, dark web, hacker forums and other closed communities, as well as CYFIRMA’s own research, attacks can be predicted using probability prediction models and analytics engines. By providing threat intelligence from the outside, CYFIRMA can share early warning information when signs of cyber-attacks are detected, enabling cyber teams to take rapid action to thwart attempts at intellectual property theft, ransomware attacks, and other malicious activities.
The CYFIRMA Data Integration Add-On for Splunk helps security teams detect cyberattack campaigns targeting their organization before an intrusion occurs by delivering the following insights:

External attack surface discovery into technology used, process and people to understand the path of attack which cybercriminals can take
Vulnerability intelligence to identify weaknesses in your external facing systems, and connect these to campaign, threat actor, IOCs and more
Brand and digital risk management help defenders understand the digital footprint which could be used to exploit cyber risk in the organization
Situational awareness to understand cyber threat trends in industry, technology and geolocation
Cyber intelligence which can deliver early view into upcoming cyber-crime being planned by cybercriminals (answering who, why, what, when and how)
DeCYFIR would automatically deliver identified threats and alerts into Splunk SIEM and SOAR platform cybersecurity controls to make them more accurate and work more efficiently.

We monitor many active cybercriminals groups and hacking campaigns to provide insights on the intent of cybercriminals such as lateral movement into your environment before a cyberattack happens. This is very key as traditional tools would identity lateral movement only after a threat have entered the environment i.e. network, endpoint, servers and application.
All the above can be directly delivered to your Splunk platform so you can proactively take corrective actions on your various tools such as EDR/NDR/XDR/Intrusion Detection/Perimeter security.",Version 1.0.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/5ad00f24-4866-11ec-9f7e-3221051fe5be.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,23,0,splunk,0,0,Cyfirma Holdings Pte Ltd,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/cyfirmasplunk,"Products: Splunk Enterprise

RECOMMENDED SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

Standard Splunk configuration of Search Head.

TOPOLOGY AND SETTING UP SPLUNK ENVIRONMENT


This app has been distributed in two parts.
1) Add-on app, which listens for Syslog messages from Illumio PCE and collects Illumio metadata using REST API Calls.
2) The main app for visualizing Illumio PCE data.


This App can be set up in two ways:


1) Standalone Mode:
Install the main app and Add-on app.

Here both the app resides on a single machine.
The main app uses the data collected by Add-on app and builds dashboard on it.

2) Distributed Environment: 
a) With heavy forwarder

Install the main app and Add-on app on search head. Add-on app on heavy forwarder.

* Configure Add-on app on heavy forwarder.
* The main app on search head uses the received data and builds dashboards on it.

b) With Splunk Universal Forwarder

Install the main app and Add-on app on search head. Add-on app on universal forwarder and indexer.

1. Configure Splunk Universal Forwarder to collect data from Illumio Server.
    * Create TCP stanza in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/inputs.conf file.
        ```
        [tcp://<PORT>]
        index=<INDEX-NAME>
        sourcetype=illumio:pce
        ```              
2. Configure the Splunk Universal Forwarder to send the data to Splunk Indexer.
    * Execute below command on SUF.
         * $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk add forward­server <IP>:<PORT> (Splunk Indexer IP and Listening Port)

3. Configure Splunk Indexer to receive data from SUF.
    * Create below stanza in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/inputs.conf file.
        ```
        [splunktcp://<PORT>]
        ```

INSTALLATION IN SPLUNK CLOUD

Same as on-premise setup.

INSTALLATION OF APP

This app can be installed through UI using ""Manage Apps"" or from the command line using the following command:

DATA MODEL

The app consist of one data model ""Illumio"". The acceleration for the data model is disabled by default. If you want to improve the performance of dashboards then enable the data model acceleration.
The accelerated data models help in improving the performance of the dashboard but it increases the disk usage on the indexer.

DATA MODEL CONFIGURATION

The Data Model used in this application is not accelerated. Admin should manually accelerate the Data Model.
The Data Model used in this application should be accelerated with 1 week's period. Admin can enable/disable acceleration or change the acceleration period by the following steps:
On Splunk’s menu bar, Click on Settings -> Data models
From the list for Data models, click “Edit” in the ""Action"" column of the row for the Data model for which acceleration needs to be enabled or disabled.
From the list of actions select Edit Acceleration. This will display the pop-up menu for Edit Acceleration.
Check or uncheck Accelerate checkbox to ""Enable"" or ""Disable"" data model acceleration respectively.
If acceleration is enabled, select the summary range to specify acceleration period.
To save acceleration changes click on save button.



REBUILDING DATA MODEL

In case there is no need to use the already indexed accelerated Data Model, the Data Model can be configured to rebuild from scratch for the specified acceleration period. Data Model can be rebuilt by the following steps:
On Splunk’s menu bar, Click on Settings -> Data models.
From the list for Data models, expand the row by clicking “>"" arrow in the first column of the row for the Data model for which acceleration needs to be rebuild. This will display an extra Data Model information in ""Acceleration"" section.
From the ""Acceleration"" section click on ""Rebuild"" link.
Monitor the status of ""Rebuild"" in the field ""Status"" of ""Acceleration"" section. Reload the page to get latest rebuild status.



TROUBLESHOOTING

If dashboards are not getting populated:
Check ""illumio_get_index"" macro is updated if, you are using the custom index.
Check if the data model is accelerated or not.
Make sure you have data in given time range.
To check data is collected or not, run "" illumio_get_index | stats count by sourcetype"" query in the search.
Try expanding TimeRange.
Try ""<instance_url>/<language>/_bump"" endpoint to clear cache and load new static content.


If sankey diagram is not visualize in Traffic Explorer dashboard's ""Communications Map between Labeled Workloads"" panel:
Be aware that you will need to install the Sankey Diagram App from https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3112/


If the user wants to summarize port scan data to some custom index then update the ""illumio_portscan_index"" macro as mentioned below:
index = <your_index>


If label filters (i.e. app, env and loc) are not populated:
Try to run the ""Illumio_Workload_Mapping"" saved search via expanding timerange.
Make sure that interval configuration for input is less than 24 hours.



UNINSTALL APP
To uninstall an app, user can follow below steps: SSH to the Splunk instance -> Go to folder apps ($SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps) -> Remove the IllumioAppforSplunk folder from apps directory -> Restart Splunk

Introduction
This add-on provides field extractions and CIM compatibility for the Endpoint datamodel for Microsoft Defender Advanced Hunting data. 
It also maps Device Alert events to the Alerts datamodel. 
The data is similar in content to Sysmon data and can be used by Detection Searches in i.e. Splunk Enterprise Security Content Update.   
Future versions may include support for Microsoft Defender for Office 365, Microsoft Defender for Identity and other products in the Microsoft 365 suite.
How is this different from other Microsoft Defender Add-ons for Splunk?
Microsoft 365 Defender Add-on for Splunk

The above uses REST API to get data, and the REST API is rate limited, whereas this TA uses Event Hub
The above will only give you Alerts and Incidents, not the raw logs
The above maps to the Alerts CIM data model, not the Endpoint CIM data model

My advice: Use both Microsoft Defender Advanced Hunting Add-on and Microsoft 365 Defender Add-on for Splunk, in order to get both alerts and the raw logs!
TA for Defender ATP hunting API

The above uses REST API to pull similar data at intervals, and the REST API is rate limited
The above is not CIM compliant

My advice: You should not need this TA if you are using Microsoft Defender Advanced Hunting Add-on for Splunk.
Installation

Configure Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to stream Advanced Hunting events to an Azure Event Hub:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/raw-data-export-event-hub?view=o365-worldwide

Use a separate Event Hub Name for Advanced Hunting data. Don't mix this data with other types of data. Failing to do so will render this Add-on useless


Install this add-on on your Search Heads, Indexers and Heavy Forwarders (if part of your data collection topology)


Install and use this Splunk add-on to ingest the data:


Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/) version 4.3.3+


When setting the up the input, enter:


Sourcetype: mscs:azure:eventhub:defender:advancedhunting


Enable the scheduled saved search Summary - Defender Advanced Hunting Malware Summary on one Search Head (preferably ES) in order to populate the Malware data model.


Verify that raw data is arriving by running the following search: index=* eventtype=""ms_defender_advanced_hunting_sourcetypes""


Verify that data for the Malware data model is populated by the scheduled saved search by running the following search: index* sourcetype=defender:advancedhunting:malware

This tool has an embeded documentation located after installation in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/utbox/appserver/static/documentation.pdf
What is what ?
The syntax of a URL is as follow:
scheme://[user:password@]domain:port/path?query_string#fragment_id
Component details:

The scheme, which in many cases is the name of a protocol (but not always), defines how the resource will be obtained. Examples include http, https, ftp, file and many others. 
The domain name or literal numeric IP address gives the destination location for the URL.
The port number, given in decimal, is optional; if omitted, the default for the scheme is used (80 for http, 443 for https, etc).
The path is used to specify and perhaps find the resource requested. 
The query string contains data to be passed to software running on the server. It may contain name/value pairs separated by ampersands, for example ?first_name=John&last_name=Doe.
The fragment identifier, if present, specifies a part or a position within the overall resource or document. When used with HTML, it usually specifies a section or location within the page, and used in combination with Anchor elements or the ""id"" attribute of an element, the browser is scrolled to display that part of the page.

List of provided Lookups
For more information, please refer to the embeded documentation.

ut_parse_simple(url)
ut_parse(url, list) or ut_parse_extended(url, list) 
ut_shannon(word)
ut_countset(word, set)
ut_suites(word, sets)
ut_meaning(word)
ut_bayesian(word)
ut_levenshtein(word1, word2)

Lookup & Macros
A generic lookup call in Splunk is of the format:
... | lookup <lookup_name> field AS field 
For example:
... | lookup ut_parse_simple_lookup url AS cs_uri
UTBox also provides macros definition for each lookup to make it easier to call the lookups. In the previous example, the call would be:
... | `ut_parse_simple(cs_uri)`
It is important to understand that those macros are simply shortcuts to lookups call. One can use one or another depending on their tastes.
History

v1.6, April 2016
new feature: the list parameter now accept a star (*) to load all lists (Mozilla, IANA, and Custom) in order to return the longest matching TLD.
Thanks to @davelugo for the idea!


v1.5, December 2015 Important changes
new feature: users can choose which list of TLD to load (2 provided by default, Mozilla Suffix List and IANA List)
ut_parse_extended requires now 2 arguments (url to parse and the list to use, ‘mozilla’, ‘iana' or 'custom')
ut_parse, mapped to  ut_parse_extended requires the same.


v1.4, November 2015
Fix incorrect parsing for hosts having a port specified (ex: tcp://host.tld:443/)


v1.3, September 2015
Hosts are no more lowered (usefull when dealing with Base64 encoded data).


v1.2, May 2015
Added ut_levenshtein()

Configure TA for Nimble Storage
There are two ways to configure the inputs for this app.
Using the Web Interface

Go to Settings->Data Inputs
Click Add New next to either Nimble Array Rest API or Nimble Array SNMP Counters depending on which one you want to add
If you are configuring an SNMP counter input you will need the Array name, the SNMP port, and the community name. You will be able to get that information from the admin interface of the array.
If you are configuring a REST API input, you will need the REST URL for the array and admin login and password.
You can set index name, interval, and sourcetype as well for either inputs under ""More settings""

Using the configuration files

In the app directory create an inputs.conf in the local directory.
Use the fields in README/inputs.conf.spec folder to make sure all fields are specified
Restart Splunk

Configure Syslog Input
This is a two part process.
On the Splunk side:

Go to TA-nimble/default
Copy inputs.conf to TA-nimble/local
Edit the inputs.conf file. Change disabled to 0 and 99999 in the stanza name to an open port on your system.
Restart Splunk

On the Nimble Storage side:

Log into the administrator console
Go to Administration -> Alerts & Monitoring -> Syslog
Click on Enable
In the syslog server field put your Splunk Server that you installed the TA on and the port you configured above",Version 1.0.4,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/5862c9c8-371b-11e6-bc93-06caea5ac9f9.png,IT Operations,http://uploads.nimblestorage.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/20094111/Nimble-Storage-License-for-Splunk.pdf,940,0,splunk,0,0,Nimble Storage,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/NimbleStorage,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

RECOMMENDED SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

Standard Splunk configuration of Search Head, Indexer, and Forwarder.

TOPOLOGY AND SETTING UP SPLUNK ENVIRONMENT


This app has been distributed in two parts.
1) Add-on app, which listens for Syslog messages from Illumio PCE and collects Illumio metadata using REST API Calls.
2) The main app for visualizing Illumio PCE data.


This App can be set up in two ways:


1) Standalone Mode:
Install the main app and Add-on app.


Here both the app resides on a single machine.
The main app uses the data collected by Add-on app and builds dashboard on it.

2) Distributed Environment: 
a) With heavy forwarder

Install the main app and Add-on app on search head. Add-on app on heavy forwarder.

* Configure Add-on app on heavy forwarder.
* The main app on search head uses the received data and builds dashboards on it.

b) With Splunk Universal Forwarder

Install the main app and Add-on app on search head. Add-on app on universal forwarder and indexer.

1. Configure Splunk Universal Forwarder to collect data from Illumio Server.
    * TCP SSL configuration
        * Create TCP-SSL stanza in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/inputs.conf file.
            ```
            [tcp-ssl://<PORT>]
            index=<INDEX-NAME>
            sourcetype=illumio:pce
            ```              
        * Then Create a SSL stanza in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/inputs.conf file.
            ```
            [SSL]
            serverCert = <path>
            sslPassword = <password>
            ```

            * To use Splunk default certificate add 
                ```
                [SSL]
                serverCert = $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/auth/server.pem
                sslPassword can be found in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/server.conf or $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/default/server.conf under [sslConfig]
                stanza
                ```
        * Restart Splunk.

    * If you are using on-prem Splunk instance and you want to configure TCP instead of TCP-SSL follow below steps:
        * Remove -SSL from TCP-SSL stanza in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/inputs.conf file.
        * Restart Splunk.


2. Configure the Splunk Universal Forwarder to send the data to Splunk Indexer.
    * Execute below command on SUF.
         * $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk add forward-server <IP>:<PORT> (Splunk Indexer IP and Listening Port)

3. Configure Splunk Indexer to receive data from SUF.
    * Create below stanza in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/inputs.conf file.
        ```
        [splunktcp://<PORT>]
        ```

Note: In order to use alert actions functionality, Please ensure you are running the latest version of the Report Viewer and have the Puppet Alert Actions add-on installed as well.
Description
This is a Splunk App that provides views into the status of the Puppet installation that is sending its reports to Splunk via the HEC. To use this viewer it has to be installed alongside the splunk_hec report processor provided in the Puppet Forge. The report processor sends data from Puppet to Splunk via the HTTP Event Collector.
The steps to get this app working are:

Install the Puppet Report Viewer app
Create atleast one HEC input (puppet:summary)
Install splunk_hec module in Puppet environment and configure with the HEC token and Splunk Server

Once configured, the overview page will start showing Puppet run report status, and information about changes over various windows of time. The views can be customized, updated, modified to suit your needs.

For detailed report generation, a feature for Puppet Enterprise Users, there are additional steps one can perform that first require configuring the app with the appropriate credentials to talk to PuppetDB and to submit events to Splunk:

Create puppet:detailed HEC input
Create a Splunk user and role in the Puppet Enterprise console, with the permission to ""View node data from PuppetDB"" under the Nodes Type
Configure Puppet Enterprise to support long life authentication tokens
Generate an authentication token (example command) : curl -k -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 
 -d '{""login"": ""splunk"", ""password"": ""password"", ""lifetime"": ""1y""}' https://localhost:4433/rbac-api/v1/auth/token
On the configuration page of the Puppet Alert Actions add-on provide the hostname of the PuppetDB server & auth token, along with the hostname of the Splunk instace running the HEC along with the puppet:detailed HEC token (this is important to use the puppet:detailed token and sourcetype, otherwise it is possible to create an alert action that continually calls itself)
With the Alert Actions add-on configured, perform a search for a specific event (such as a puppet run with a failed or changed status) sourcetype=""puppet:summary""| spath status | search status=failed save it as an alert, and assign the action ""Generate detailed report"" from the action menu. No configuration of the action is needed.



Advanced Configuration
All report views support using custom indexes for storing event data. They accomplish this with a series of advanced search macros. The queries assume each sourcetype can be stored in it's own index (facts, summary reports, detailed reports, bolt events, action events, Puppet Enterprise metrics).
There is one top level macro, puppet_index which defaults to """", if you configure the HEC to use a different index and want all Puppet in that index, change that value here to be index=puppetindexname.
If you are using puppetlabs/splunk_hec version 0.5.0 or later, you can specify different HEC tokens for Summary Reports, Facts, and Metrics. Then create an index and an associated HEC token associated with those sourcetypes, and configure both the splunk_hec module in Puppet with those new values. Actions, Bolt Events, and Detailed Reports are all submitted via different tools and would need ot be changed according to use a different HEC token. Then the corresponding macro's updated to use those indexes.
For example, if you want most Puppet data to go to one index, but Facts, Metrics, and Detailed Reports to go to their own indexes, one would follow these steps:
- Create four indexes: puppet_data, puppet_facts_data, puppet_metrics_data, and puppet_detailed_data (or whatever name makes sense), each with their desired timespan, retention, etc.
- Create four HEC's (example names):
1. puppet with sourcetype of puppet:summary and the index puppet_data
2. puppet_facts with sourcetype of puppet:facts and the index of puppet_facts_data
3. puppet_metrics with sourcetype of puppet:metrics and the index of puppet_metrics_data
4. puppet_detailed with sourcetype of puppet:detailed and the index of puppet_detailed_data
- Configure the splunk_hec module with the corresponding tokens
1. splunk_hec::token with the value from the puppet HEC (since you want all Puppet using splunk_hec plugin to go here, except for facts and metrics)
2. splunk_hec::token_facts with the value from the puppet_facts HEC
3. splunk_hec::token_metrics with the value from the puppet_metrics HEC
- Update the Puppet Report Viewer's configuration to use the puppet_detailed HEC token, because detailed reports are pulled from Puppet and generated by the alert action in this application
- Update the advanced search macros to use the new values:
1. Open Advanced Search under the Settings -> Knowledge menu
2. Select Search Macros
3. Select puppet_index and change the definition to index=puppet_data, click save
4. Select puppet_facts_index and change the definition to index=puppet_facts_data, click save
5. Select puppet_metrics_index and change the definition to index=puppet_metrics_data, click save
6. Select puppet_detailed_index and change the definition to index=puppet_detailed_data, click save
- Reload the main view of the Puppet Report Viewer app, and you should see data, or perform the following search:
`puppet_all_index` sourcetype=puppet:*

The Github App for Splunk is a collection of out of the box dashboards and Splunk knowledge objects designed to give Github Admins and platform owners immediate visibility into Github.
This App is designed to work across multiple Github data sources however not all all required. You may choose to only collect a certain set of data and the parts of this app that utilize that set will function, while those that use other data sources will not function correctly, so please only use the Dashboards that relate to the data you are collecting.
The Github App for Splunk is designed to work with the following data sources:

Github Audit Log Monitoring Add-On For Splunk: Audit logs from Github Enterprise Cloud.
Github.com Webhooks: A select set of webhook events like Push, PullRequest, and Repo.
Github Enterprise Server Syslog Forwarder: Audit and Application logs from Github Enterprise Server.
Github Enterprise Collectd monitoring: Performance and Infrastructure metrics from Github Enterprise Server.

Dashboard Instructions
Installation
For Splunk Cloud, refer to Install apps in your Splunk Cloud deployment. For non-Splunk Cloud deployments, refer to the standard methods for Splunk Add-on installs as documented for a Single Server Install or a Distributed Environment Install.
This app should be installed on both your search head tier as well as your indexer tier.
Configuration

The Github App for Splunk uses macros so that index and sourcetype names don't need to be updated in each dashboard panel. You'll need to update the macros to account for your selected indexes.
The macro github_source is the macro for all audit log events, whether from Github Enterprise Cloud or Server. The predefined maco includes examples of BOTH. Update to account for your specific needs.
The macro github_webhooks is the macro used for all webhook events. Since it is assuming a single index for all webhook events, that is the predefined example, but update as needed.
Finally, the macro github_collectd is the macro used for all collectd metrics sent from Github Enterprise Server. Please update accordingly.

Dashboard Usage
Out of the box, there are a few categories of dashboards available:

Enterprise Server Monitor - A set of dashboards to monitor GitHub Enterprise Server infrastructure metrics. 
Audit - A set of dashboards that report on Audit logs events from both GitHub Enterprise Cloud and GitHub Enterprise Server.
Add-On Monitoring - Listed on the Dashboards page is a dashboard called Integration Monitoring that is used to keep an eye on how the Github Audit Log Monitoring Add-On for Splunk is working. This is only useful if you are using that Add-On and also requires access to Splunk _internal logs.

Tips and tricks for growing your Splunk instance from 50GB/day to 1TB/day
The conf 2017 presentation recording is available here, and PDF only here. The powerpoint presentation is available here
Introduction
This application accompanies the Splunk conf 2017 presentation ""How did you get so big? Tips and tricks for growing your Splunk installation from 50GB/day to 1TB/day""
The overall idea behind this application is to provide a variety of alerts that detect issues or potential issues within the splunk log files and then advise via an alert that this has occurred
This application was built as there were a variety of messages in the Splunk console and logs in Splunk that if acted upon could have prevented an issue within the environment.
The original presentation is available as a recording or PDF
The powerpoint should it be required is available here
There are many potential alerts that might cause an issue so this application has all alerts disabled by default, post-installation once the required macros are configured you can enable the alerts you wish to use and add the required actions
There are also dashboards for investigating indexer performance, heavy forwarder queue usage, data model acceleration issues among other items that may be of interest to a Splunk admin
Please note that the all alerts & dashboards were tested on Linux-based Splunk infrastructure, with AIX, Linux and Windows forwarders
If you are running your Splunk enterprise installation on Windows or have customised your installation directory you will need to customise some of the macros such as splunkadmins_splunkd_source to point to the correct splunkd log file location
Also note that this application contains a very large number of alerts which you can use, you may wish to utilise the allow_skew in savedsearches.conf to allow the scheduler to balance out the scheduled alerts execution times
Finally, the application has evolved over the years, more recent releases have resulted in very generic alerts such as AllSplunkEnterpriseLevel - Splunkd Log Messages Admins Only, this is designed as a ""catch all"" to cover many splunkd log messages. The older alerts are very specific as the team I worked in was new to Splunk and required a more specific outcome/action based on each alert
Feel free to use either, and feedback or contributions via github or email are always welcome
Macros - required configuration
The various saved searches and dashboards use macros within their searches, you will need to update the macros to ensure the searches/dashboards work as expected
To check the contents of the macros in Splunk 7 or newer, use CTRL-SHFT-E within the search window
The macros are listed below, many expect a host=A OR host=B item to assist in narrowing down a search while others expect only a single value...note that for splunk_server values they are always lower-case and case-sensitive!
indexerhosts - a host=... list of your indexers (for example host=indexer1 OR host=indexer2)
heavyforwarderhosts - a host=... list of your heavy forwarders (for example host=heavyforwarder1 OR host=heavyforwarder2)
searchheadhosts - a host=... list of your search head(s) (for example host=searchhead1 OR host=searchhead2)
localsearchheadhosts - a host=... list of your search head(s) within the cluster that these alerts are running on
splunkenterprisehosts - a host=... list of any Splunk enterprise instance (for example host=indexer1 OR host=searchhead1 OR ...)
deploymentserverhosts - a host=... list of deployment server(s) (for example host=splunkdeploymentserver)
licensemasterhost - a host=... entry for the license master server (for example host=splunklicensemaster)
searchheadsplunkservers - a splunk_server=... list of any Splunk search head hosts (for example splunk_server=searchhead*)
splunkindexerhostsvalue - a splunk_server=... list of any Splunk indexer hosts (for example splunk_server=indexer*)
splunkadmins_splunkd_source - this defaults to source=*splunkd.log, for a slight improvement in performance you can make this a specific file such as /opt/splunk/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log
splunkadmins_splunkuf_source - this defaults to source=*splunkd.log, you may wish to narrow down this location if your splunkd logs on universal forwarders have consistent installation directories
splunkadmins_mongo_source - this defaults to source=*mongod.log, for a slight improvement in performance you can make this a specific file such as /opt/splunk/var/log/splunk/mongod.log
splunkadmins_clustermaster_oshost - a host=... entry for the cluster master server (for example host=splunkclustermaster)
The macros are used in various alerts which you can optionally enable, the alerts will raise a triggered alert only as emails are not allowed for Splunk app certification purposes
The macros are also used in the dashboards for this application
The vast majority of the alerts also have a macro(s) which you can customise to tweak the search results, for example the macro splunkadmins_weekly_truncated allows the alert, IndexerLevel - Weekly Truncated Logs Report, to be customised without changing the alert itself. This will make upgrading to a new version of this app more straightforward
I have attempted to provide an appropriate macro in any alert where I deemed it appropriate, feedback is welcome for any alert that you believe should have a macro or requires further improvement
Installation
The application is designed to work on a search head or search head cluster instance, installation on the indexing tier is not required
There are a few searches that use REST API calls which are specific to the search head cluster they run on. These alerts will have to be placed on each search head or search head cluster, alternatively any server with the required search peers will also work, the relevant alerts are:
- SearchHeadLevel - Accelerated DataModels with All Time Searching Enabled
- SearchHeadLevel - Realtime Scheduled Searches are in use
- SearchHeadLevel - Realtime Search Queries in dashboards
- SearchHeadLevel - Scheduled Searches without a configured earliest and latest time
- SearchHeadLevel - Scheduled searches not specifying an index
- SearchHeadLevel - Scheduled searches not specifying an index macro version
- SearchHeadLevel - Scheduled Searches Configured with incorrect sharing
- SearchHeadLevel - Saved Searches with privileged owners and excessive write perms
- SearchHeadLevel - User - Dashboards searching all indexes
- SearchHeadLevel - User - Dashboards searching all indexes macro version
- SearchHeadLevel - Users exceeding the disk quota (recent jobs list uses a REST call so you may need to adjust the search), the SearchHeadLevel - Users exceeding the disk quota introspection is a non-search head specific alternative
The following reports also are specific to a search head or search head cluster:
- SearchHeadLevel - Alerts that have not fired an action in X days
- SearchHeadLevel - Data Model Acceleration Completion Status
- SearchHeadLevel - Macro report
- What Access Do I Have?
The following dashboards are search head or search head cluster specific:
- Data Model Rebuild Monitor
- Data Model Status
The following reports / alert must either run on the cluster master or a server where the cluster master is a peer:
- ClusterMasterLevel - Per index status
- ClusterMasterLevel - Primary bucket count per peer
Using the application
Once the application is installed, all alerts are disabled by default and you can enable those you require or want to test in your local environment.
If you choose not to customise the macros then many searches will search for all hosts, which will make the alerts and dashboards inaccurate!
Which alerts should be enabled?
The alerts are all useful for detecting a variety of different scenarios which may or may not be applicable within your Splunk environment
The description field has an (extremely) simple way of determining if an alert will require action, there are three levels:
  - Low - the alert is informational and likely relates to a potential issue, these alerts may produce false alarms
  - Moderate - the alert is a warning, most likely further action will need to be taken, a moderate chance of false alarms
  - High - the alert is likely relating to something that requires action and there is a very low chance that this will create false alarms
I do not have a nice way to auto-enable various alerts excluding editing the local/savedsearches.conf or via the GUI, any contribution of a setup file would be welcome here!
How is this application used?
In the current environment the vast majority of the alerts are enabled to detect issues, they raise automated tickets or email depending on the urgency of the specific alert.
There are a few environment characteristics that may require changes to the way the app is used, and feedback is welcome if there is a nicer way to structure the alerts/application
The overall assumption is that the admin(s) are not carefully watching the splunkd logs or the messages in the console of the monitoring server/Splunk servers
How is this application tested?
Before 2019 the universal forwarders in use are installed on a mix of Windows, Linux & AIX servers, in 2019 and beyond the testing scope has been vastly reduced to focus primarily on Splunk enterprise servers
All heavy forwarders, and Splunk enterprise installations are Linux based, while I expect the alerts will work with only changes to the macros.conf for a Windows based environment this remains untested
The test environment for this application has a single indexer cluster and two search head clusters
Why was this application and associated conf talk created?
Inspired by articles such as ""Things I wish I knew then"" and knowledge collected from various conference replays, SplunkAnswers, 200+ support tickets & nearly four years of working on a Splunk environment I decided that I would attempt to share what I have learned in an attempt to prevent others from repeating the same mistakes
There are many Splunk conf talks available on this subject in various conference replays, however my goal was to provide practical steps to implement the ideas. That is why this application exists
Which alerts are best suited to automation?

SearchHeadLevel - Scheduled searches not specifying an index
SearchHeadLevel - Scheduled Searches Configured with incorrect sharing
SearchHeadLevel - Splunk login attempts from users that do not have any LDAP roles
SearchHeadLevel - Scheduled Searches That Cannot Run
SearchHeadLevel - Scheduled Searches without a configured earliest and latest time
SearchHeadLevel - Users exceeding the disk quota
SearchHeadLevel - Users with auto-finalized searches
SearchHeadLevel - User - Dashboards searching all indexes
SearchHeadLevel - Detect Excessive Search Use - Dashboard - Automated
SearchHeadLevel - WLM aborted searches
SearchHeadLevel - Dashboards with all time searches set
SearchHeadLevel - SavedSearches using special characters
SearchHeadLevel - Dashboards using special characters
SearchHeadLevel - Dashboards using depends and running searches in the background
= SearchHeadLevel - Summary searches using realtime search scheduling
SearchHeadLevel - Searches dispatched as owner by other users
SearchHeadLevel - Search Messages user level
SearchHeadLevel - audit logs showing all time searches

Are all well suited to an automated email using the sendresults command or a similar function as they involve end user configuration which the individual can change/fix
Custom search commands
Due to the current SPL not handling a particular task well, and the lookup commands not supporting regular expressions, I found that the only workable solution was to create a custom lookup command.
Two exist:
- streamfilter - based on a single (or multivalue) field name, and a single (or multivalue) field with patterns, apply the regular expression in the pattern field against the nominated field(s)
- streamfilterwildcard - identical to streamfilter except that this takes a field name with wildcards, and assumes an index-style expression, so * becomes (?i)^[^_].*$, and example* becomes (?i)^example.*$
Search help is available and these are used within the reports in this application. The Splunk python SDK version 1.6.5 is also included as this is required as part of the app, an example from the reports is:
| streamfilterwildcard pattern=indexes fieldname=indexes srchIndexesAllowed
Where indexes is a field name containing a list of wildcards (_int*, _aud*) or similar, indexes is the output field name, srchIndexesAllowed is the field name which the indexes field will be compared to.
Each entry in the pattern field will be compared to each entry in the srchIndexesAllowed field in this example
To make this command work the Splunk python SDK is bundled into the app, if the bin directory is wiped due to issues with other applications this only disables the two commands which are used in Search Queries summary non-exact match so far
KVStore Usage
Some CSV lookups are now replaced with kvstore entries due to the ability to sync the kvstore across multiple search head or search head cluster(s) via apps like KV Store Tools Redux
Lookup Watcher
The Lookup Watcher is a modular input designed to work in either search head clusters or standalone Splunk instances to determine the modification time and size of all lookup files on the filesystem of the Splunk servers.
In a search head cluster the input will run on the captain only by running a rest call on each run, on a non-search head cluster it will always run.
To use this, on a non-search head cluster simply go to Settings -> Inputs and create the Lookup Watcher modular input, the name of the input does not matter, you just need to create 1 input.
Note that the debugMode is optional and defaults to false, enabling this generates more logs for troubleshooting.
Under the more settings button choose an index to send the data to and an interval to run the script
On a search head cluster you will need to push an inputs.conf via the deployer server (if you are unsure of the syntax create one on a standalone server first)
Once done the additional logs can be used to determine how often lookups are updated and how big they are
Lookup Watcher generates a log file is created in $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/ and will also be in the internal index with the name lookup_watcher.log
platform_stats reports
There are a number of reports with the keyword ""platform_stats"" in the title, these were designed to run mcollect commands and to collect data into a metric index
The metrics then contain detailed information around the number of users using Splunk per-search head cluster, data indexed at the indexing tier, resource usage per user et cetera.
There is plenty of detail in here but dashboards were not included for the information built from them, contributions welcome
Detecting which indexes are searched by Splunk users
As of version 8.0.8 there is still no accurate way to detect which indexes were searched by a user based on their level of access, the audit logs simply do not record which indexes were accessed
Therefore the following searches are part of this app to help achieve this goal:
- SearchHeadLevel - Search Queries summary exact match
- SearchHeadLevel - Search Queries summary non-exact match
As per the searches description they both require other reports such as SearchHeadLevel - Macro report, the description of each search details the various reports they rely on to make them work.
However these complicated searches are not 100% accurate, alternative searches exist in this app to work at the indexing tier:
- IndexerLevel - RemoteSearches Indexes Stats 
- IndexerLevel - RemoteSearches Indexes Stats Wildcard 
The remote_searches.log at the indexing tier does not (usually) need to perform macro substitution but instead you do not have information around the user that ran the searches so this search is more likely to overcount index access than the search tier version, it is also less likely to miss an index due to macro usage or similar...
In more detail, the challenges with the search head level's audit.log searches are:
- You cannot determine which index was used if multiple indexes were specified, for example a search such as index=A OR index=B, if this search results in more than 0 results, then you cannot be sure which index returned the results so both are recorded by searches in this app
- macros, eventtypes, tags and datamodels are recorded in the audit.log so you need to substitute the macro/eventtype/tag to correctly determine if an index is in use, to make this more complicated, macros can be nested so a macro may refer to another macro and the 2nd or 3rd macro may contain the index= information
- There are many ways to search an index, such as index= """", index IN (...), the regex'es attempt to deal with the various straightforward scenarios such as NOT index=A index=B, but it is not straightforward to correctly extract index names from the audit.log in all scenarios
- The audit.log information for ad-hoc searches does not record app-context, therefore even if you know the macro and user information, you cannot be sure which app the search was run from and therefore you cannot correctly substitute the macro/tag/eventtype information
At the indexing tier the remote_searches.log file has different challenges:
- While macros, eventtypes and tags are expanded (in most cases, there are bugs that allow macros to reach the indexing tier), you instead lose the user context in cases such as ad-hoc searches. This means that a search like index=* run by a user with permissions to access 1 index to these searches will appear to be accessing all indexes. The current implementation of the RemoteSearches queries in this app assume access to all indexes if the username is unknown (which may result in excess matching rather than missing searches)
- app context is again missing for ad-hoc searches, although this is less important at the indexing tier
- You cannot determine which index was used if multiple indexes were specified, for example a search such as index=A OR index=B, if this search results in more than 0 results, then you cannot be sure which index returned the results so both are recorded
The following ideas relate to this issue:
Better audit logs
Provide index access statistics to assist in capacity planning of the indexing tier

The Splunk Add-on for Recorded Future is designed specifically for Splunk Enterprise Security.
This Add-on integrates with the Splunk ES Threat Intelligence Framework by adding a feed containing information security threat indicators from Recorded Future. With this added feature, defenders can automate the process of finding connections between internal incidents and external sources. This can work bidirectionally: searching Recorded Future for more context around internally observed indicators, or testing trending indicators from open source reporting against internal data sets.
The Add-on also simplifies the workflow of analysts working within the ES environment by adding contextual actions to the Incident Review and event searching and reporting views. This includes information on IPs, domains, file hashes and CVEs.
For more information on Recorded Future, visit www.recordedfuture.com.
Requirements

Splunk ES must be installed on the Splunk system
A valid Recorded Future API token is required.
The Splunk server running the app must be able to download a CSV
    file containing Recorded Future's IP risk list from
https://api.recordedfuture.com/.

Installing and configuring
Installation
To install this Add-on, perform the following steps:

Download the latest TA release from Splunkbase (apps.splunk.com)
In Splunk, select ""Manage Apps"" from the drop-down menu next
       to the Splunk logo on the upper left of the screen
Select ""Install app from file""
Browse to the location of the TA-recorded_future.spl file,
     select it and upload. Restart Splunk when prompted to do so.
In the Enterprise Security menu bar,
     click Configure → Incident Management → Incident Review Settings.

Click the button 'Add new entry' in the ""Incident Review -
     Event Attributes"" section. Add the following Label and Field
     combinations:
| Label                           | Field
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| RF Risk Score                   | rf_a_risk               |
| RF Triggered Rules              | rf_b_rules              |
| RF Very Malicious Evidence      | rf_evidence_critical    |
| RF Malicious Evidence           | rf_evidence_malicious   |
| RF Suspicious Evidence          | rf_evidence_suspicious  |
| RF Unusual Evidence             | rf_evidence_unusual     |



A restart of the Splunk instance will be required once the
      installation has completed.

If you haven't already done so, enable the Enterprise
      Security correlation search called ""Threat Activity Detected"" 
In the Enterprise Security menu bar, click Configure → Content Management
In the filter bar, type ""Threat Activity Detected""
Click the link 'Enable' to enable the correlation search


Optionally, create a post install verification report. Run the
     ""Validate app deployment"" report. It will perform a number of
     tests, none of which should yield an error.
Go to Dashboards, Reports... → Reports.
Run Validate app deployment.



Alternatively, you can download the Add-on using the Splunk Web
interface's ""Find more apps online"" feature. Steps 5 and onwards above
must still be completed.
Configuration
After installation, you will need to set up the Add-on for Recorded
Future to communicate with the Recorded Future API. 

Go to Configuration → Configuration.
Select the Add-on Settings tab.
Enter the API Key.
Review the other tabs if additional configuration is required.

Upgrading from previous versions
The setup needs to be run after the upgrade. The API key (previously
called token in our documentation) will not carry over from the old
configuration. The same goes for proxy and loglevel configurations.
Upgrade from 3.x versions
Due to the extent of the changes between version 2 and 3 of the app
  we recommend that you remove the app directory
  ($SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-recorded_future) and make a fresh install
  of the app.
If that is not possible proceed with the instructions below.
Files and directories that can be removed
The following files and directories can be removed 
since they are not used anymore:
From the bin folder:
future
libfuturize
past
requests
rf_integrations
rf_splunk
rfapi
splunklib
get-rf-threatlists.py
rf_es_setup.py
verify_rf_app.py
From the local folder (if present):
commands.conf
From the local/data/ui/nav folder (if present):
default.xml
Files that must be reviewed
Any file in the local folder is the result of a 
local configuration. These have precedence over the
new settings shipped with the app. Review differences 
in each file in the local folder compared to the
new default in the default folder and adjust if 
required.
In particular correlation searches in 
savedsearches.conf are likely to cause issues if
in place.

Compatability
The Cybereason App for Splunk enables you to gain deep insight & visibility into your endpoints, detect advanced attacks based on AI hunting, and take response actions within Splunk. The Cybereason AI Hunting Engine automatically asks a complex set of questions of data collected from all of your endpoints at a rate of 8 million calculations per second, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This means the solution is continuously hunting on your behalf by asking the same sorts of questions advanced security analysts would ask as they hunt for threats inside an environment. The difference, however, is that the Cybereason malicious activity models run constantly, and continually adapt and evolve according to the data the solution receives and analyzes.
When the Cybereason AI Hunting Engine identifies malicious behavior, its classified based on context and severity. Suspicions represent multiple pieces of anomalous behavior which are related and therefore more likely to be malicious. Malops (malicious operations) are a collection of related suspicious activities that are highly likely to indicate a security incident, and are defined in a way that minimizes the likelihood of analysts spending time investigating benign activities or false positives. Both Suspicions and Malops are presented in Splunk along with insights that give context to the alerts so you can quickly understand what is happening in your environment.

User Guide
Configure Cybereason For Splunk


Install the App according to your environment (see steps above)


Navigate to App > IA-CybereasonForSplunk > Administration > Application Configuration


Application Configuration Dashboard
To configure the Cybereason application you should start on the Application Configuration page (Administration > Application Configuration)*[]:
Application Configuration
On this screen you can set the base index via event type as well as indicating that you have configured the app. Make sure you click the SAVE button to access the additional dashboards.
Encrypted Credentials
You can view/delete existing credentials on this tab. These are credentials that are being used by existing modular inputs in the Cybereason application. These credentials are the credentials used to connect to Cybereason appliances.
Cybereason
On this screen you can view and make any changes to existing modular inputs. As you make changes and tab between fields the modular input is modified.
Creating New Credentials
By default creating a new modular input with a username and password specified will create the necessary encrypted credentials. However if you want to create encrypted credentials manually follow this process:


Navigate to the Credentials tab.


To create a new encrypted credential, click the Create New Credential button and fill in with the appropriate username and password.


The realm is the application name where the encrypted credential is created + the username.


NOTE: By default creating a new modular input will automatically create a new encrypted credential so this process is not necessary unless you need a new credential for another purpose.
Updating Existing Credentials
If you want to update existing credentials manually follow this process:


Navigate to the “Cybereason” tab.


Copy the Credential Realm of the Input for which credentials have to be updated.


Navigate to the “Credential” tab.


Search for the Credential using the copied Credential Realm.


Delete the existing Credential of that Credential Realm using the delete button.


To update credential, click the Create New Credential button and fill in with the appropriate information below:

Username (The username of the configured input)
Password (The new password for that username) 
Realm (Credential Realm of the configured input)



Creating New Cybereason Inputs
NOTE: You will need to configure a new modular input for each Cybereason host.
NOTE: The Suspicious data type should be only pulled 1 once per day. This particular input pulls all available suspicious items, not just the time-based delta, at the time of ingest. Please configure a separate input with interval 600 for the suspicious data type.


To create a new data input, click the Create New Cybereason Input button and fill in the following fields. Those with a red asterisk on the screen are required.


Modular Input Name: Name for the data input configuration.


Base URL: The hostname or IP address and port of the Cybereason service. By default you can specify hostname:443.


Username: The username used to connect to the service.


Password: The password for the previously specified service.


Toggle all data keys: Check to select all data keys.


Data keys: List of endpoints available on the Cybereason service. Check the data key if you wish to pull event data.


Interval: The number of seconds indicate how often the input will poll for new data. This setting must be at least 60.


Index: This sets the index for data to be written to. This setting should be changed from default, which normally writes to the main index, to a specified index for best performance. The index must exist on the Search Head and Indexer.




After creating the modular input you may need to disable/re-enable the input in Settings > Data Inputs > Cybereason For Splunk to activate the input.


NOTE: When configuring the modular input through the Application Configuration dashboard, the password is automatically encrypted into the credential store. If you need to change the credential, create a new credential, and reference the host/user pair in the modular input configuration. An encrypted credential is required for this Splunk App.
Indexes
By default all events will be written to the main index. You should change the index in the configuration files to match your specific index.

== Author ==

== Description ==
Traffic Ray analyses real time HTTP WEB traffic via Apache Web logs generated on Web hosting servers (including WHM and Cpanel based) and offers visual dashboards representing WEB activity trends and hit patterns across all hosted websites and visitor's IP addresses.
It helps you to uncover malicious hits, suspicious incoming activity patterns, spammy attacks and coordinated penetration attacks targeting any of the hosted websites.
Additionally to that Traffic Ray app helps to discover inefficiencies within actively operating websites and specific pages that leads to excessive bandwidth consumption and reduced server performance.
Traffic Ray allows you to filter stats and visualizations by specific IP address, Hosted website name as well as by entering fragments of Splunk query directly into the dashboard input.
Summary information tables offers extra sorting and drilldown features to dig deeper into details of every IP address or specific Website activity.
== Installation and Setup ==
Traffic Ray uses standard Apache Web server logfiles as the main source of data.
These logs files usually match Splunk sourcetypes of: 'access_combined' or 'access_combined_wcookie'.
Before you can see your Web traffic data within Traffic Ray you need to create index to store data from your apache Web logs and create data inputs.

Install Traffic Ray app first.
Login to your Splunk instance as admin.

Go to Apps -> Manage Apps and follow installation instructions available at that screen to install Traffic Ray app.


Create index (or indexes) to store data from your apache Web logs.

Login to your Splunk instance as admin
Go to: Settings -> Indexes -> [New].
Enter the index name - make sure it starts with 'apache_', for example: 'apache_domlogs' or 'apache_acc_logs'
     Traffic Ray app uses the following base query to retrive data:
     'index=apache_ sourcetype=access_combined  ... ' -- and hence make sure your indexes are named as apache_*
You may leave all other fields empty/at their default values.

Press [Save]


Create data inputs to point to directories on your server where Apache log files are generated (or received from forwarder).

Locate Apache web logs on your server. Run this command (as root user) to get an idea about the web logs location if you're not sure:
     lsof -nP -c apache2 -c httpd | grep -i s_log
To proceed with instructions lets assume that you've created an index named: 'apache_domlogs'
     and the location of your apache web logs on a server is: '/usr/local/apache/domlogs/'
Login to your Splunk instance as admin
Create Data input. Go to:
     Settings -> Data Inputs -> Files & directories -> [New]
""File or Directory"" = /usr/local/apache/domlogs/*
""Blacklist"" = (log.offset|bytes_log|-ftp_log|-(200[0-9]|201[0-3])|(Jan|Feb|Mar|Apr|May|Jun|Jul|Aug)-2014)
     This blacklist regex allows you to exclude FTP logs, irrelevant files and files dated older that September 2014.
     This allows you to limit amount of data inflow into Splunk to avoid overloading your Splunk license limit.
     Adjust it as you see fit.
Click [Next] button.
Sourcetype: click [Select], [Select Sourcetype], Web, access_combined
App Context -> [Traffic Ray]
Host -> [Regular Expression on path]
""Regular Expression"" = \/
     This regular expression allows Traffic Ray to extract domain or subdomain name from the name of the actual log file.
Index -> [apache_domlogs]
Press [Review] button
Press [Submit] button.

Once you completed creation of data input Splunk start indexing your data and you may navigate to Traffic Ray dashboards and start seeing stats almost immediately.

http://www.rapid7.com
Using this Technology Add-on:
Setup:
Please see Splunk's official documentation for the initial installation of the add-on.
After installation, you may be prompted to proceed to the set-up screen in order to configure the app. Alternatively, this page may be accessed by navigating to the app management screen and selecting the 'Set up' action associated with the Rapid7 Add-On.
On the set-up screen, the following details must be entered:

Nexpose username
Nexpose password
Nexpose address (IP or hostname)
Nexpose port

The application records the latest scan for a site when importing data. This means that whenever the script runs, it has the option of only importing data if a new scan exists. To enable this behaviour, tick the checkbox labelled ""Import data only when a new scan exists"". If this option is not enabled, asset and vulnerability data will be imported even if a new scan has not occurred since the last time the script executed. 
The application also offers the option to import a limited amount of solution information along with each vulnerability. To enable this behavior, tick the checkbox labelled Import solution data with vulnerabilities. If this option is enabled, a solution summary, number of related solutions and the solution type(s) will be included with each vulnerability event.
You may notice that some vulnerabilities have no solution data - this is because there is no solution available that is relevant for that particular asset, based on its operating system etc.
Creating Rapid7 Index
In previous versions of the add-on, the rapid7 index was automatically generated during installation. With the most 
recent release (v1.2.0) it is now necessary to create the index prior to configuring the modular inputs. Following the
Splunk instructions for Creating a Custom Index
and name it rapid7 in order to leverage the default index name used while configuring the inputs. 
This step can be skipped if an index has already been created for data imported by the Nexpose Technology Add-On.
Adding a modular input:
In order for the application to index data, you must create a modular input job and specify the IDs of the sites for which data will be imported.
Under Settings>Data inputs>Rapid7 Nexpose choose the 'New' option to create a job. By default, data will be written to the ‘rapid7’ index. To set a custom index, expand the ‘More settings’ panel and change the ‘Index’ value. 
Assets and Vulnerabilities:
When creating a job for importing asset and vulnerability info, select the 'Assets and Vulnerabilities' option for the 'Job Type'. 
If you wish to import asset and vulnerability data only for specific sites, enter their site IDs (separated by commas) within the 'Sites' box. Leaving this box blank will import data for all sites.
You may create multiple jobs for importing asset and vulnerability information, containing different site IDs. It is recommended to split large sites into individual, staggered jobs.
Vulnerability Exceptions:
To import vulnerability exception information, select the 'Vulnerability Exceptions' option for the 'Job Type'. This will import data for all vulnerability exceptions and therefore it is not necessary to enter site IDs.
Vulnerability exceptions are imported regardless of whether the app is set to only import new scans or not. 
Module details:
Vulnerability Information:
All Rapid7 Vulnerability data will conform to the Splunk Vulnerability Common Information Model. All Rapid7 vulnerability data events will have the source 'Rapid7_Nexpose_Splunk_Vulnerability_Data' and will have a sourcetype of 'rapid7:nexpose:vuln'. 
All fields with multiple values will be separated with a semicolon e.g. a vulnerability with more than one vulnerability category related to it (Apache, Apache HTTP Server, IAVM, Web) will have a Splunk CIM field vulnerabilities.dest value of ‘Apache;Apache HTTP Server;IAVM;Web’. 
These fields are limited to 1250 characters. If such a field has been truncated, the field's value will end with an ellipsis (""...""). 
Asset Information:
All Rapid7 Asset data will conform to the Splunk Vulnerability Common Information Model. All Rapid7 vulnerability data events will have the source 'Rapid7_Nexpose_Splunk_Asset_Data' event and will have a sourcetype of 'rapid7:nexpose:asset'. 
All fields with multiple values will be separated with a semicolon e.g. an asset with multiple services running on it (CIFS, DCE Endpoint Resolution, DCE RPC, Microsoft Remote Display Protocol, SSH) will have a Splunk CIM field inventory.services value of 'CIFS;CIFS Name Service;DCE Endpoint Resolution;DCE RPC;Microsoft Remote Display Protocol;SSH’.
These fields are limited to 1250 characters. If such a field has been truncated, the field's value will end with an ellipsis (""...""). 
Vulnerability Exception Information:
Vulnerability exception data events will be have the source 'Rapid7_Nexpose_Vulnerability_Exception_Data' event and will have a sourcetype of 'rapid7:nexpose:vulnexception'.
Debugging:
Two log files are available to help debug issues contained within <splunk_home>/var/log/splunk/:

splunkd.log - Splunk general log
TA-rapid7_nexpose.log - Log for the Rapid7 Technology Add-on

uberAgent consists of two main components: the actual agent runs on the endpoints you want to be monitored, sending the data it collects to the configured backend either directly or via Splunk's Universal Forwarder. The second main component, implemented as a set of Splunk apps, provides dashboards, visualizations, searches, and reports.
The Agent
uberAgent's data collecting component is a lightweight agent that runs independently of any runtimes or frameworks. The agent's footprint is so small that it is truly unobtrusive on the monitored endpoints and does not affect user density.
Where other products rely on operating system sources such as performance counters, WMI, or similar unfiltered data, uberAgent comes with its own metrics. Instead of raw data uberAgent gives you information that matters (see uberAgent's list of metrics).
The agent is highly configurable: metrics can be turned on or off individually, the data collection frequency can be chosen freely, blacklists and whitelists (supporting regular expressions) allow for fine-grained control. This ensures that only data you really need is sent to the backend for indexing.
Browser Extensions
uberAgent's endpoint agent is complemented by browser extensions, which enable uberAgent to collect performance and usage metrics from web apps, too. Extensions are available for all major browsers.
The Splunk Apps
Multiple Splunk apps help process and visualize the data collected by the agent. The indexer app lives on Splunk indexers and mainly creates uberAgent's index and data input. Dashboard apps implement the user interface, providing different views into the collected data. uberAgent comes with two dashboard apps: one for uberAgent UXM and another for uberAgent ESA.
uberAgent's main apps are complemented by special-purpose apps that offer a different view of the existing uberAgent data, such as the uberAgent Helpdesk app.
Most dashboards are searchable and have extensive filtering capabilities to give you a fast and powerful way of isolating specific data. Time range pickers make it easy to go back to the exact time a problem occurred.
uberAgent makes full use of Splunk's advanced UI components to display a beautiful user interface that fluidly adapts to screen width and device type. As a result, it works equally well on a tablet as on a PC or Mac.

Search hash, domain, and ip information from VirusTotal, ThreatCrowd, TotalHash, PassiveTotal, and Censys.io
This app uses the public/free versions of the above API providers.
Some results are truncated to 20 items due to the potential for thousands of items returned.
API Providers
Hash Search
•    VirusTotal
•    ThreatCrowd
•    TotalHash
Domain Search
•   PassiveTotal
•   Censys.io
•   VirusTotal
•   ThreatCrowd
•   TotalHash
IP Search
•   PassiveTotal
•   Censys.io
•   VirusTotal
•   ThreatCrowd
•   TotalHash
Setup
In order to use some of the API providers in this App, you must create a directory called local in the app's home path and create a file called api_keys.conf in the local directory.
ThreatCrowd is the only API provider that does not require an API key, see each providers website for obtaining an API credentials.
There is an example api_keys.conf in the default directory. You can simply copy that file into local and place your api credentials in it.
Below is an example as to how to create your api_keys.conf
$ cd /opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-security/
$ mkdir local
$ cp default/api_keys.conf local/
$ vi local/api_keys.conf
Enter your API Credentials
Obtain API Credentials
You can obtain API credentials for the API Providers at the following links
VirusTotal: https://www.virustotal.com/en/
TotalHash: https://totalhash.cymru.com/contact-us/
PassiveTotal: https://www.passivetotal.org/registration
Censys.io: https://censys.io/register
Using Dashboards
You can search All or some of the API providers by clicking checkboxes on the Hash Lookup, Domain Lookup, or IP Lookup views
If you do not click a checkbox, that API provider is NOT contacted with the query, and the subsequent panel is not generated
Steps:

Enter searchitem
Select API providers
Click Submit

Notes:
•   TotalHash requires a SHA1 hash
•   ThreatCrowd does not require an API key
Create your own Panels
Perhaps you want to run your own searches or create panels in your own dashboards using these queries... You can totally do that!
Below are some examples for creating your own searches

This technical add-on is designed to connect to a CrowdStrike provided Falcon Data Replicator environment. It leverages the SQS queue to determine if there are available data files to download. Once identified the TA will attempt to download the data file, decompress it and post the data into Splunk.

Benefits of using the FDR SQS based TA

Since there is no data filtering the data is able to be processed faster
The SQS queue is leveraged to track when a message is available for processing so there is no checkpoint that needs to be created in Splunk
Multiple inputs can be configured on the same or different systems with minimal risk of data duplication
Bulk message posting decreases the amount of time the data is processed, increasing posting time

Considerations before using the FDR SQS based TA

There is no ability to filter data, all FDR data will be ingested into Splunk
Once a message has been posted to Splunk's internal API it is removed from the SQS queue and cannot be ingested again
Specific start dates are not configurable

Please note:
The data provided by FDR is not ""real time"" and not recommended for use in alerting use cases. The CrowdStrike Event Streams API is designed to facilitate rapid audit and alert data transfer, the Splunk Add-On for the Event Streams API can be found here: CrowdStrike Falcon Event Streams Technical Add-On
For customers interested collecting the AID Master data from FDR, it's also recommended to review the information that is available via the Falcon Devices API. The CrowdStrike Falcon Devices TA can facilitate ingestion of that data into Splunk and can be found here: CrowdStrike Falcon Devices Technical Add-On
This Technical Add-On provides support for:
Splunk v8+ with Python 3
CrowdStrike Provide FDR S3 and SQS infrastructures
CrowdStrike US based, EU and GovCloud environments

    2. name
    3. type
    4. title
    5. email
    6. biz_unit
    7. biz_dep
Step 3
Click on the Chargeback Identities - Summary Index - Gen Job - From REST to collect all the users defined on the Search Head you are running this job on.
This job must be configured on every Search Head in your stack including your Input Data Manager (IDM).
Step 4
Login to every Standalone Search Head and Search Head Cluster in your stack and create the following Job:
Job Name: chargeback_rest_identities_summary_data_gen
Job Schedule: Edit the Job and Schedule it with the following Cron Expression: 18 3 * * * 
Job Search:
| rest /servicesNS/-/-/authentication/users splunk_server=local timeout=0
| rename title As user_name , realname As name roles As splunk_role_map type As auth_type
| eval Splunk_Instance = lower(splunk_server), user_name = lower(trim(user_name)), email = lower(email)
| stats Last(name) As name , Last(email) As email , Values(splunk_role_map) As splunk_role_map , Values(auth_type) As auth_type By Splunk_Instance, user_name
| eval _time = now() | foreach splunk_role_map, auth_type [ eval <<FIELD>>=mvjoin(mvsort(mvdedup('<<FIELD>>')), ""|"") ]
| table _time, Splunk_Instance, user_name, name, email, splunk_role_map, auth_type
| collect index=chargeback_summary source=splunk_rest_identities_summary_data sourcetype=stash testmode=false | stats count

Finish by running the Job for the first time on the Search Head or Search Head Cluster you configured it on.
Step 5
Go back to the App Setup Dashboard and click on the Chargeback Identities - KV Store - Gen Job - From Summary Index Job to create the chargeback_rest_identities_kv_store_lookup KV Store Lookup for the first time.
Step 6
Click on the Chargeback Tracker Job link and make sure the job produces data and runs without any errors.

App Terminology

Splunk Cloud Virtual Core (SVC) is a unit of capabilities that includes these resources in Splunk Cloud: compute, memory, and I/O.
Dynamic Data: Active Searchable(DDAS) is used for searching ingested data. DDAS is also commonly known as searchable storage or Local Storage including Splunk Cloud SmartStore.  For further information see: Dynamic Data: Data Retention Options in Splunk Cloud
Dynamic Data: Active Archive(DDAA) is Splunk Cloud Index Archiving in AWS S3 Glacier.  Its an optional Splunk Cloud subscription.  DDAA offers a lower cost option for long term storage of your ingested data.  DDAA Can be restored to DDAS to be searched.
Dynamic Data: Self-Storage(DDSS) is your own Index Archiving Self Storage AWS S3 Bucket.  It allows you to export your aged data from Splunk Cloud Platform. If you enable DDSS to export your aged ingested data, the oldest data is moved to your Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage account in the same region as your Splunk Cloud Platform deployment before it is deleted from the index.
-- Please Note the following about DDSS:  You are responsible for payments for your use of Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage. Aged data is exported unencrypted to your Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage account.  For further information see:

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5698,2022-01-09,08:34:58 AM,App compatibility checker,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/screenshots/25207b60-548d-11ec-b239-72089c50c975.png,"Dec. 3, 2021","Splunk upgrade app compatibility checker
Which moving parts are there?

| getsplunkversions which reaches out to doc.splunk.com to get a list of available splunk versions.
    Those are used within the ""Target Splunk Version"" drop down.
| checkappcompatibility target_version=x.x.x does the heavy lifting. It depends on a list of
    apps provided by splunks REST API | rest /services/apps/local but it is intentionally kept separated.
    To be able to reach out to the splunkbase API we need the ID's of the apps to check. Therefore
checkappcompatibility looks for that information within update.homepage. If there is no URL provided
    it tries to retrieve the ID using the app's title field.

How to use it?

You can use the provided dashboard which lets you check locally installed apps against a ""Target Splunk Version"".
You can use the CSC checkappcompatibility manually like that: | rest /services/apps/local | checkappcompatibility target_version=8.2.1
   if you have usecases not covered by the dashboard.
You can export the results of the REST call and ingest them into another splunk box to let the app check the
   status there. This comes quite handy if you prepare to upgrade an air-gapped splunk deployment. 

Are there limitations?

Sometimes splunkbase does not list multiple versions of an app. If your version is not listed, the compatibility
  can't be checked. The checker will therefore recommend to update to the most recent app version which supports your
  target splunk version.
Obviously there a couple of apps which are not listed within the splunkbase so they cannot be checked. They will marked
  as ""undecided"" (see belows screenshot).
This app is by no means a substitution of Splunk's python upgrade readiness app
  as it does not analyze any code. It simply reach out to splunkbase to check compatibility information listed there.
You technically could check deployment apps but the REST API call mentioned does only contain apps installed locally.",Version 1.0.1,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/06b112f4-548b-11ec-ad41-8640b36b5fa1.png,IT Operations,https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,116,0,splunk,5,1,Daniel Glauche,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/dglauche,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

The app supports Deep Discovery Inspector, Deep Discovery Email Inspector and Deep Discovery Analyzer logs. It helps your organization identify and take action against targeted attacks.
The complete documentation is available here: 
http://docs.trendmicro.com/all/ent/dd_app_splunk/v1.1.2/en-us/dd_app_for_splunk_1.1.2_olh
To ask a question regarding this app, please go to:
http://answers.splunk.com/app/questions/2867.html

ddappsupport@trendmicro.com
Support hours are Monday through Friday, 9am - 5pm, U.S. Pacific Time, exclude weekends and national holidays. You may expect a response within 3 business days.
Activating Deep Discovery App

Go to Configuration > License
Specify a valid Activation Code. Use any valid Deep Discovery Inspector, Deep Discovery Email Inspector or Deep Discovery Analyzer Activation Code.
Click on the Activate button.

Deep Discovery App Configuration
To enable the app to process Deep Discovery Inspector, Deep Discovery Email Inspector and Deep Discovery Analyzer event logs:

Go to Configuration > App Set Up.
Specify name of the index; example ""index=ddi_index"".
Specify source type; example “sourcetype=tmef-*”.
Click Save.

Please refer to the online documentation for instruction on configuring the
app to enable Web Access Log Correlation.
Deep Discovery Product Configuration
Deep Discovery App assigns the source type “cefevents” to data entering Splunk
through TCP port 8080. Subsequently, the app assigns more granular source types
that start with “tmef-” to received data. The source types enable Splunk to
correctly format data during indexing and to perform more specific event
processing. If your network firewall prevents the Splunk server from receiving
data through port 8080, you must configure a new data input based on your
network policy. For example, typical syslog servers use UDP port 514.

Configuring Deep Discovery Inspector:


For v3.6 and 3.7, go to Logs > Syslog Server Settings; for v3.8, go to
     Administration > Integrated Products / Services > Syslog.
Click Add.
On the Add Syslog Server screen, select Enable syslog server.
Enter IP address of the Splunk server for the IP address field, and
     appropriate port for the Port field. Specify TCP for the Protocol field.

uberAgent consists of two main components: the actual agent runs on the endpoints you want to be monitored, sending the data it collects to the configured backend either directly or via Splunk's Universal Forwarder. The second main component, implemented as a set of Splunk apps, provides dashboards, visualizations, searches, and reports.
The Agent
uberAgent's data collecting component is a lightweight agent that runs independently of any runtimes or frameworks. The agent's footprint is so small that it is truly unobtrusive on the monitored endpoints and does not affect user density.
Where other products rely on operating system sources such as performance counters, WMI, or similar unfiltered data, uberAgent comes with its own metrics. Instead of raw data uberAgent gives you information that matters (see uberAgent's list of metrics).
The agent is highly configurable: metrics can be turned on or off individually, the data collection frequency can be chosen freely, blacklists and whitelists (supporting regular expressions) allow for fine-grained control. This ensures that only data you really need is sent to the backend for indexing.
Browser Extensions
uberAgent's endpoint agent is complemented by browser extensions, which enable uberAgent to collect performance and usage metrics from web apps, too. Extensions are available for all major browsers.
The Splunk Apps
Multiple Splunk apps help process and visualize the data collected by the agent. The indexer app lives on Splunk indexers and mainly creates uberAgent's index and data input. Dashboard apps implement the user interface, providing different views into the collected data. uberAgent comes with two dashboard apps: one for uberAgent UXM and another for uberAgent ESA.
uberAgent's main apps are complemented by special-purpose apps that offer a different view of the existing uberAgent data, such as the uberAgent Helpdesk app.
Most dashboards are searchable and have extensive filtering capabilities to give you a fast and powerful way of isolating specific data. Time range pickers make it easy to go back to the exact time a problem occurred.
uberAgent makes full use of Splunk's advanced UI components to display a beautiful user interface that fluidly adapts to screen width and device type. As a result, it works equally well on a tablet as on a PC or Mac.

Depends on your needs, you can use one of the following methods:
a. Configure Splunk universal forwarder of MBX to run as Exchange Admin, enable the following 3 stanza in inputs.conf, and let Splunk generate the csv, collect/parse csv file and cleanup those csv file. Ingest csv file will consume less Splunk license.
i)   [powershell://generate_exchange_mailbox_forward_rules_csv]
ii)  [powershell://cleanup_mailbox_forward_rules_csv]
iii) [monitor://$SPLUNK_HOME\var\log\TA_MS_ExchangeForwardingRules_for_splunk\MSExchange_ForwardRule_.csv]
b. Configure Splunk universal forwarder of MBX to run as Exchange Admin, enable the following stanza in inputs.conf, and let Splunk directly collect/parse using PowerShell.
i)   [script://.\bin\run_exchange_ps.cmd on_premises_exchange_mailbox_forward_rules.ps1]
c. Leave Splunk universal forwarder of MBX user unchanged, manually configure a windows schedule to collect/cleanup Exchange Forwarding Rules using our PowerShell script, enable the following stanza in inputs.conf to collect the generate csv file.
i)  You need to provide the correct csv_path and csv_file arguments to the powershell collection script, e.g.:
""C:\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\etc\apps\TA_MS_ExchangeForwardingRules_for_splunk\bin\powershell\on_premises_exchange_mailbox_forward_rules.ps1"" -csv_path ""C:\Splunk"" -csv_file ""MSExchange_ForwardRule""
ii)  You need to provide the correct csv_path, csv_file and age arguments to the powershell collection script, e.g.:
""C:\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\etc\apps\TA_MS_ExchangeForwardingRules_for_splunk\bin\powershell\cleanup_exchange_mailbox_forward_rules_csv.ps1"" -csv_path ""C:\Splunk"" -csv_file ""MSExchange_ForwardRule"" -age ""-3""
iii) Configure the correct path of generate csv for the following stanza:
[monitor://$SPLUNK_HOME\var\log\TA_MS_ExchangeForwardingRules_for_splunk\MSExchange_ForwardRule_.csv]

Other considerations:

You may deploy this add-on to DR/standby Exchange servers.
If you are planning to run it on non-Exchange instance, you need to install Exchange Management tools.

The Cisco CMX Add-on for Splunk is used to gather data from CMX devices and do field extraction. 
REQUIREMENTS

Splunk version >= 6.3
If using a forwarder, it must be a HEAVY forwarder( we use the HF because the universal forwarder does not include python)
The forwarder system must have network access (HTTP/HTTPS) to one or more CMX devices which are to be Splunked.

Admin user ID and password for collecting data from CMX device.


Application can work on both Windows and Linux platforms


Recommended System configuration

Splunk forwarder system should have 4 GB of RAM and a quad-core CPU to run this app smoothly.

Topology and Setting up Splunk Environment

This app has been distributed in two parts.

1) Add-on app, which runs collector scripts and gathers data from CMX devices, does indexing on it and provides indexed data to the Main app.
  2) The main app, which receives indexed data from Add-on app, runs searches on it and builds a dashboard using indexed data.


This App can be set up in two ways:
  1) Standalone Mode: Install the main app and Add-on app on a single machine.

Here both the app resides on a single machine.
The main app uses the data collected by Add-on app and builds dashboard on it



2) Distributed Environment: Install the main app and Add-on app on search head, Only Add-on on forwarder system and indexes.conf file from Add-on bundle on Indexer.
 * Here also both the apps resides on search head machine, but no need to configure Add-on on search head.
 * Only Add-on needs to be installed and configured on forwarder system.
 * Execute the following command on forwarder to forward the collected data to the indexer.
   $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk add forward-server <indexer_ip_address>:9997
 * On Indexer machine, enable event listening on port 9997 (recommended by Splunk).
 * Main app on search head uses the received data and builds dashboards on it.

Installation of App


This app can be installed through UI using ""Manage Apps"" or extract zip file directly into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ folder.


After installation, go to the Apps->Manage Apps->Set up TA-CMX. New set up screen will open which will ask for CMX parameters, set appropriate parameters.


Please note, if you are using a self-signed certificate, set appropriate argument on the setup page.


Sample Event generation

This application bundles sample events which can be used for test purpose. To generate sample events, you will require Splunk_SA_Eventgen > 4.0.

Support

Email support will be provided as best effort.
CMX Connectors are supported by the CMX Cloud team at Cisco.
Cases can be opened by sending an email to cmx-cloud-support@external.cisco.com
Support requires a valid CMX installation and a CMX Advanced Licenses on applicable Access Points.
Cases can be opened 24x7

TEST YOUR INSTALL
The main app dashboard can take some time to populate the dashboards Once data collection is started. A good test to see that you are receiving all of the data we expect is to run this search after several minutes:
search `cmx_index` | stats count by sourcetype

In particular, you should see these sourcetypes:
 cmxhttp
 cmxanalytics
 cmxactive
 cmxmap
If you don't see these sourcetypes, check log file under $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/TA-CMX/tacmx.log.",Version 1.4,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/9d1087d2-1b99-11e7-af65-02f13bdc2585.png,"IT Operations, DevOps",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,410,0,splunk,5,1,Crest Data Systems,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/neha10,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

datapower appliance, virtual appliance or docker image
hostname or IP address of the appliance
REST Management interface enabled
user account and password to use for basic auth when connecting to the REST Mgmt API port

A docker image (used to develop this TA) is available here - details on how to setup the docker image and a simple service are also documented at this location.
IBM provide a developers edition download here
Enabling the REST management interface is documented here
DataPower TA Setup
Once installed, launch the app.
Click on ""Configuration"":
(1) Add an account with the credentials you will use to make the REST API Calls
(2) Click Add-on Settings and add the hostname and port of the datapower device to be monitored
To setup a REST API call to an available DataPower endpoint:
(1) Click Inputs
(2) Click Create New Input
(3) Select the type of call to be made: Status, Config or Filestore
(4) Enter a name for the input - it's best if the name matches the metric or class name, e.g. SystemUsage
(5) Enter the polling interval in seconds (e.g. 60)
(6) Choose the index to store the events in
(7) Enter the text of the DataPower domain to be monitored
(8) Enter the metric name / configuration class / filestore path to be monitored
(9) Click Add
=> Congratulations, you are now monitoring your DataPower appliance.
Testing
Switch to the Search tab

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3338,2022-01-09,08:35:44 AM,Custom Timewrap Visualization,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/screenshots/ddeb67fc-677c-11e7-9f0a-02e4f408b860.png,"June 25, 2017","Galleries
After installing the timewrap visualization app, launch it to see a couple gallery dashboards with live examples of how to use the visualization.  If you no longer need the gallery and want to hide the app from navigation menus, you can make the app invisible.  The timewrap visualization itself will still be available to use in all other apps.
Basic Configuration
This XML snippet will plot 3 months of data with a month-over-month overlay:
<viz type=""viz_timewrap.timewrap"">
    <title>Default chart appearance</title>
    <search>
        <query>[...] | timechart span=1d sum(bytes) as ""Bytes Transferred""</query>
        <earliest>-3mon@mon</earliest>
        <latest>now</latest>
    </search>
</viz>
Note: For best results, the bin size of the query should be aligned with the point span of the visualization.  In the example above, the query time range produces a month-over-month visualization with a point span of 1 day (i.e. a point for each day in the month).  The span=1d argument to timechart aligns the query bin size to that point span.
Trellis Configurations
This XML snippet will show two timewrap visualizations, one for the ""Bytes Transferred"" time series and one for the ""Average Latency"" time series:
<viz type=""viz_timewrap.timewrap"">
    <search>
        <query>[...] | timechart span=5m sum(bytes) as ""Bytes Transferred"", avg(latency) as ""Avgerage Latency""</query>
        <earliest>-4h@h<earliest>
        <latest>now<latest>
    </search>
    <option name=""height"">400</option>
    <option name=""trellis.enabled"">1</option>
    <option name=""trellis.size"">large</option>
</viz>
This XML snippet will show a timewrap visualization for each value of server_id, displaying the ""Bytes Transferred"" time series for that specific server:
<viz type=""viz_timewrap.timewrap"">
    <search>
        <query>| [...] | timechart span=1h sum(bytes) as ""Bytes Transferred"" by server_id</query>
        <earliest>-7d@d<earliest>
        <latest>now</latest>
    </search>
    <option name=""height"">800</option>
    <option name=""trellis.enabled"">1</option>
    <option name=""trellis.size"">large</option>
</viz>
Notes: The ""large"" trellis size is recommended for the timewrap visualization.  For crowded plots, rotating the x-axis labels and/or re-positioning the legend (see Customization Options below) are good ways to free up space and make the plot more readable.
Customization Options
axisLabelFormat
The format to use when displaying dates and times can be configured for the x-axis.  The formatting rules are specified as shown here.
The default behavior is to choose a format based on the current visualization data.

xLabelRotation
Values: ""on"" or ""off""
Default: ""off""
When enabled, rotates the x-axis labels by 90 degrees.
legendPlacement
Values: ""right"", ""bottom"" or ""none""
Default: ""right""
Customizes the location of the legend, or when set to ""none"", hides the legend.
pointMarkers
Values: ""on"" or ""off""
Default: ""off""
When enabled, shows a marker on each point.
Drilldown
Clicking on a point will drill down to the events that occurred during the time range that point represents.

SIEM provides a centralized view for security teams to easily access and analyze security information from a large number of sources, and prioritize mitigation efforts based on risk profiles.SIEM Integration is a comprehensive solution for capture, retention, and delivery of security information and events in real-time to SIEM applications. Customers using Kona Site Defender, Client Reputation, Web Application, or Bot Manager (BETA) can analyze security events generated on the Akamai platform and correlate them with security events generated from other sources.System RequirementsAkamai’s Splunk Connector requires Oracle JRE 1.8+. Download the latest from the Oracle Java site (Java Platform, Standard Edition) or install it from a software distribution package on Linux.You must have Java installed on the host running Splunk Enterprise https://java.com/en/download/Also, check to make sure that splunk forwarder is NOT installed on your Splunk Enterprise host machine.Proxy serverTo access the SIEM API from behind a proxy server, ensure that your proxy:whitelists the domains *.cloudsecurity.akamaiapis.net and *.luna.akamaiapis.netdoes not interfere with HTTP request headers for those domains.

This Splunk App provides a Custom Search Command named cyberchef that allows you to apply CyberChef operations and recipes to your events.  This App also provides a local version of the CyberChef web GUI.
Quick Example:
| makeresults count=3 
 | streamstats count
 | eval data=random()/random() 
 | cyberchef infield='data' outfield='convertedData' operation=""ToBase64"" 
 | table data convertedData
When you run the above example, you'll get something like the following output:



data
convertedData




1.267541990694
MS4yNjc1NDE5OTA2OTQ=

MS43Mzg4NTE5OTE1OTg3OTE=



Here we generate three results with random data in the 'data' field (the first three lines of SPL). We then use CyberChef's toBase64 operation to convert the values in the 'data' field into base-64 representation, and save the results to the 'convertedData' field. Finally, we display the data in a table.
Installation
You should install this App on all your Splunk Indexers and Search Heads (there is no benefit or harm to installing it on any forwarders).  You must reboot Splunk after installation. No configuration is required to use this App.
This App runs on Windows and Linux, and works with Splunk versions 7.3 - 8.2.
Usage
This App will allow you to apply CyberChef operations and recipes through a custom search command named cyberchef.  This custom search command requires that you specify the input field to operate on, the CyberChef operation or recipe to apply to the data in that field, and optionally a different output field to write the results to.
In the simplest usage: the following SPL will apply the ""toBase64"" operation to the ""inData"" field, and save the results back to the ""inData"" field (overwriting the original field).
... | cyberchef infield='inData' operation=""ToBase64"" |...
There are four ways to specify the CyberChef operation or recipe to use. You must choose one of these parameters:
1. operation:  A single operation with no parameters.
2. jsonRecipe: A recipe saved as compact json.
3. encodedRecipe:  A recipe saved as compact json, then converted to base64. 
4. savedRecipe:  A recipe in saved as compact json, saved to a text file located in this App's ./local/recipes/ folder.
A CyberChef operation is a single function applied to the specified field for each event from your data. For example: converting data from a base64-encoded string using the FromBase64 operation.
A CyberChef recipe is one or more operations chained together, where each operation can have optional parameters.  For example: converting data into a base64-encoded string (using the ToBase64 operation), and then calculating the SHA3 hash with an output size of 256 of that base64 encoded data using the SHA3 operation with the 256 output-size option.
Recipes (versus an operation) must be formatted in CyberChef's compact json format (more information below), which can be done through the CyberChef web GUI.
Please make sure to read the section below titled Charsets, Quotes, and Escaped Characters and Parameter ordering before you try to use this app to avoid errors, as parameter ordering is important.
operation parameter
This is the simplest method, and allows you to apply a single CyberChef operation without any parameters.
From the CyberChef node.js API documentation:  Operation names are camelCase versions of the operations on the web app, except for when the operation name begins with more than one uppercase character. For example, ""Zlib Deflate"" becomes zlibDeflate, but ""SHA2"" stays as SHA2.  That being said: this App's implementation of CyberChef is really flexible with naming, see the section below CyberChef Operation Names.
... | cyberchef infield='inData' operation=""ToBase64"" |...
If you want to save the results to a different (or newly created field), include the 'outfield' parameter:
... | cyberchef infield='inData' outfield=outData operation=""ToBase64"" |...
jsonRecipe parameter
If you need to use multiple operations (a recipe), or your operations require non-default parameters, you can't use the operation parameter. One way to solve this is with the jsonRecipe parameter. This allows you to specify a complete recipe in your SPL command.  The recipe is formated in compact-json.
To create this json string: From the CyberChef GUI, construct your recipe by dragging the operations you want to the ""recipe"" section.  Once the recipe is correct: click the ""save"" icon at the top (the floppy disc icon), and then select the ""compact json"" tab. This is the compact-json representation of this recipe, and is what to use for this parameter.
An example:
... | cyberchef infield='inData' outfield=""outData"" jsonRecipe=""[{""op"":""To Base64"",""args"":[""A-Za-z0-9+/=""]}]"" |...
encodedRecipe parameter
This is similar to the jsonRecipe paraemter, except the recipe is encoded in base64 format (this is helpful if you have parameters in your recipe that aren't part of the ASCII character set).
To create this base64 string: Just like above, From the CyberChef GUI, construct your recipe by dragging the operations you want to the ""recipe"" section.  once the recipe is correct: click the ""save"" icon at the top (the floppy disc icon), and then select the ""compact json"" tab. This is the compact-json representation of this recipe. You then need to convert that json string into a base64-encoded string (using the CyberChef GUI and the ToBase64 operation), and use the result for this field.
For example, if you wanted a recipe to convert a string from base64 and then generate the SHA2 hash, you would build this recipe in the CyberChef GUI, click the ""save"" button, click on the ""compact json"" tab to get the following recipe in compact json format:
[{""op"":""From Base64"",""args"":[""A-Za-z0-9+/="",true]},{""op"":""SHA3"",""args"":[""512""]}]
Next: You need to convert this json string into a base64 encoded string (using CyberChef's toBase64 function in the GUI). This gives us the following string:
W3sib3AiOiJGcm9tIEJhc2U2NCIsImFyZ3MiOlsiQS1aYS16MC05Ky89Iix0cnVlXX0seyJvcCI6IlNIQTMiLCJhcmdzIjpbIjUxMiJdfV0=
that string is now the value for the encodedRecipe parameter:
... | cyberchef infield = 'inData' encodedrecipe = ""W3sib3AiOiJGcm9tIEJhc2U2NCIsImFyZ3MiOlsiQS1aYS16MC05Ky89Iix0cnVlXX0seyJvcCI6IlNIQTMiLCJhcmdzIjpbIjUxMiJdfV0="" |...
savedRecipe parameter
If you find yourself using the same recipes over and over, you can save them in this App's ""./local/recipe"" folder with a nickname to easily reference them. 
first create a ./local/recipe/myRecipes.txt text file.  In this file, add the following content:
# Comment: the line below is a recipe you can reference from the CyberChef custom search command
myComplexRecipe  :  [{""op"":""SHA3"",""args"":[""512""]}]
You don't need to reboot Splunk to use these recipes, but you need to make sure the recipe is avaliable on all your Splunk servers. Run the following SPL to reference this recipe:
... | cyberchef infield = 'inData' recipe = ""myComplexRecipe"" |...
To test this, I have made two savedRecipe examples avaliable. The First coverts the event to moorse code:
... | cyberchef infield='inData' recipe=example_moorse  |...
the second example converts the event to to base64, then to moorse code:
... | cyberchef infield='inData' recipe=example_xml_moorse  |...
You can have as many text files you want, with as many saved recipes as you want.  This App will parse all text files in the ./local/recipe/ folder for recipes.  The first matching recipe name will be used.
See the ./default/recipes/READEME.txt file included with this App for more details.
outfield parameter
This optional parameter specifies which field to write the results of the CyberChef operation or recipe to.  If you don't specify this field, then the results will be written back to the field specified by the infield parameter.  You can specify an existing or new field with this parameter. If the field already exists, the value will be overwritten with the results. If the field does not exist, it will be created in your results.  If CyberChef is not able to process the data in your infield (say you tried to apply an invalid operation to your data), the outfield will be blank for that event.
... | cyberchef infield='inData' outfield='modifiedData' operation=""ToBase64"" |...
Debug parameter
This optional parameter can either be set to full for full debug information (including the contennt of messages passed between splunk and this app, including the data from your events), or to info for the same information, excluding the actual data sent and received.  The debug information is saved to a file named debug.log in the search's dispatch directory.  If you have a problem and are requesting assitance, you'll probably want to include the debug log.
... | cyberchef infield='inData' debug=full operation=""ToBase64"" |...
... | cyberchef infield='inData' debug=info outfield='modifiedData' operation=""ToBase64"" |...
Important Notes
Parameter Ordering
You must start with the infield parameter, followed by the optional outfield and debug parameters. You must end with one of the four recipe/operation parameters listed above.  If you don't follow this order, you will get an error (this ordering makes it easier to parse the SPL and minimizes the number of characters you need to escape in your SPL).
Charsets, Quotes, and Escaped Characters
This command only supports the ASCII characterset in the SPL (but can support any Unicode characters in your data). What this means is that your fieldnames and your recipes must be ASCII chars; essentially if you type it in as SPL, it must be ASCII. If you have non-ASCII characters in your json or recipe, you can either use the encodedreipce or savedrecipe option to run the command. 
This command should be able to handle most types of quotes for field names (infield and outfield).  If your field name only has alphanumeric characters (the \w character set), you don't need to quote it, otherwise use single-quotes for your field names.  For fieldnames, you must escape the single-quote and the pipe character.  For example, if you have a field named a|b, and you wanted to save the output to a field named b 'or' a, your command would be:
... | cyberchef infield='a\|b' outfield='b \'or\' a' ...
For the encodedRecipe parameter, you don't need quotes (but they won't hurt).
For the savedRecipe and command parameters, if the name is only alphanumeric (\w), you don't need quotes.  If you have any other characters or spaces, you should enclose the string in single or double-quotes. The Pipe in the string must be escaped with a backslash.
Basically: when in doubt, use single-quotes. Fieldnames need the single quote and pipe escaped with a backslash, and the command you use only needs the pipe escaped.
CyberChef Operation Names
CyberChef is really flexible about how you specify the operation name with regard to case sensitivity and spaces. All of the following work fine when specifying the operation:
ToBase64, toBase64, tOBaSe64, ""to base 64"", ""to Base64"", ""toB ase 64"".  
Essentially CyberChef ignores case and spaces when determining the command you want. If you include spaces, quote the operation. Don't include the parenthesis for the operation.  Unfortunately you can't specify any parameters for the operation (use a recipe or encodedRecipe if you require that). This is due to a way that Splunk parses the SPL before sending it to the custom search command. 
CyberChef Operations
This App should support all CyberChef operations offered by the CyberChef node.js API, which exclude only a few commands.  This App uses Splunk's version of node (8.16), which isn't officially supported by CyberChef, but all the CyberChef unit tests passed, so there shouldn't be any problem running any of the supported CyberChef operations.
Performance: While you could chain multiple CyberChef operations together like this:
... | cyberchef infield='x' operation='fromBase64"" | cyberchef infield='x' operation='SHA3'  |  ...
You should avoid this when possible since there is a performance impact. Each time you run the cyberchef custom search command: there is a delay as the libraries are loaded (twice in the above example).  It will be much more efficent to use one of the other recipe parameters rather than the operation parameter multiple times.  Once the CyberChef libraries are loaded for a command, the processing tends to be relatively fast.
CyberChef Web GUI
This App provides a local version of the CyberChef Web GUI. It can be found by opening the App in Splunk Web, and clicking the link in the Nav Bar for CyberChef.
Support
Please submit bug and feature requests via Github, or email Noah@SublimeRobots.com.  Please include as much information as possible with your request.  This App is not professionally supported (it is a volunteer project), so issues may not be fixed immediately, but I will make every effort to reply.
This app implements version 2 of Splunk's custom search protocol manually (since there's no SDK for node.js), which I had to reverse-engineer with limited documentation.  Therefore, there are very likely some edge cases that you will run into that need to be fixed.  Please submit them via Github with as much information as possible (that will allow me to easily re-create and fix the issue).
Future releases of this App will focus on bug-fixes and performance (since it's not effectively leveraging node's asynchronous functionality effectively).

Introduction
This input provides a mechanism to create, update, and delete event streams in Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Endpoints via the API and index them in your Splunk® instance to make them searchable. All you need to do is provide your API host and credentials from your AMP for Endpoints account and specify the stream parameters (like events or which event types and groups should be directed to this stream).
This app was tested on Splunk v8.1
Prerequisites
It is expected that a user of this app:

is familiar with Cisco AMP for Endpoints and understands the concepts of AMP business, events, event types, and groups.
has an account within a working instance of the cloud hosted version of AMP for Endpoints Console. At this point, there is no support for private cloud AMP for endpoint appliances
has a set of Read/Write AMP API credentials.
knows how to access the event types and groups API endpoints in order to retrieve the codes of event types and guids of groups.

Architecture
This app comes with a custom interface to ensure that every meaningful action (like creating, editing, or deleting an input)
yields expected results.
Please note: This app interacts with a third-party service, namely, Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Endpoints.
This app also uses Splunk’s built-in key-value store for persisting crucial information about event streams.
Installation
This app can be installed directly from Splunkbase. The app will appear in your Splunk Apps navigation bar after it is
successfully installed. When you visit one of the app pages, it will ask you to provide settings on the configuration page.
The configuration contains options related to authenticating to the AMP server by API calls, specifically:

API host (Web address of the Cisco AMP for Endpoints API found in the AMP for Endpoints API documentation)
API id (3rd Party API Client ID provided by AMP for Endpoints. The credentials must allow read and write access.)
API key (API secret key that corresponds to the API id above.)

Once these have been configured you are ready to create and use the inputs.
Use cases
Creating an input
You need to create the input to have the events flow into your index. To do this, go to the app interface and navigate to
‘New Input’. If your app is properly configured, you can populate the fields:

'Name' should contain the Input name. The Name must be unique and cannot be changed later. If you attempt to create an input with the Name of an input that already exists, the validation will fail.
'Index' contains the Splunk index the events will be directed to. It defaults to 'main', however you can specify any index within your instance. The index cannot be changed after the input is saved.
'Stream name' should contain the unique name of an event stream. Since event streams can be created not only from Splunk app, but also via the API interface, this name serves a purpose of distinguishing the streams.
'Event Types' allows you to select one or more event types to direct to the stream. You can only select event types that are accessible by your business. Leave this field blank to return all event types.
'Groups' allows you to select one or more connector groups to direct to the stream. Leave this field blank to return all groups in the business.

When you click ‘Save’, the stream with the parameters you provided will be created within AMP for Endpoints.
If there is a validation failure, the appropriate message will be displayed.
Leave either the Event Type or Groups field blank to direct all respective event types or groups to the created stream and the Splunk index.
Please note: the number of event streams per business is limited to 5.
Updating an input
To update an input, click on its name at the inputs list view. Follow the procedures described previously to change the
stream parameters. Please note: you will not be able to edit the input name or index.
Deleting an input
To delete an input, click the ‘Delete’ link in its row at the inputs list view. Confirm your choice to finish the procedure.
The event stream will be deleted from AMP for Endpoints along with the input.
Searching for events
By default, the events from the stream will be directed to the ‘main’ index. They will be populated with the sourcetype of cisco:amp:event

This add-on exports your Splunk search results to remote destinations so you can do more with your Splunk data. It provides search commands and alert actions to export/push/upload/share your data to multiple destinations of each type. The app must be configured via the Setup dashboard before using it. The setup dashboard includes a connection test feature in the form of a ""Browse"" action for all file-based destinations.
Supported Export Formats

JSON
Raw Text
KV Pairs
Comma-Delimited (CSV)
Tab-Delimited (TSV)
Pipe-Delimited

File-Based Destinations

AWS S3-Compatible Object Storage  (S3, Google Cloud Storage, MinIO)  
Box.com Cloud Storage  
Windows/SMB File Shares  
SFTP Servers  

Streaming Destinations

Splunk HTTP Event Collector  

Credential Management
Use the Credentials tab to manage usernames, passwords, and passphrases (used for private keys) within the Splunk secret store. Certain use cases (such as private key logins) may not require a password, but Splunk requires one to be entered anyway. For passphrases, type any description into the username field. OAuth credentials such as those for AWS use the username field for the access key and the password field for the secret access key. Due to the way Splunk manages credentials, the username field cannot be changed once it is saved.  
Authorization via Capabilities
Add read capabilities for each command to users who require access to use the search command or alert action. Add write capability to allow them to make changes to the configuration. By default, admin has full access and power has read-only access. Credential permissions must be granted separately, but are required to use each command that depends on them.

About Google Workspace For Splunk
Google Workspace For Splunk allows a Splunk Enterprise administrator to interface with Google Workspace, consuming the usage and administrative logs provided by Google. The limitations on collection times are specified: https://support.google.com/a/answer/7061566 .
Version 1.5.3




Bug




[GSUITE-41] - Internal GW Log parsing


Updated internal Google Workspaces log parsing to better have actual sourcetypes.


index=_internal sourcetype=google:workspaces*








[GSUITE-42] - Enable Bulk Edit for inputs

Updated the Configuration UI to allow for bulk editing. Look for the pencil and checkmarks at the top-right of the tables.







[GSUITE-43] - Checkpointing Broken

Checkpointing was using the wrong function and was pulling data from the initial write of the first data pull. This has been fixed.











Improvement


Upgraded various Python packages in $APP_HOME/lib/


Fixed the About Dashboard.






Known Issues
Version 1.5.3 of Google Workspace For Splunk has the following known issues:


According to stackoverflow, there are indications that the Google Apps Admin API has an unspecified delay introduced into the events that are collected. This is most likely due to how Google collects the events and the global nature of the events. To mitigate this issue, the Google Workspace For Splunk Modular Input has a built-in delay in the consumption of events. If you run the modular input at 30 minutes, there will be a 30 minute delay of events. If you run at 1 hour, there will be a 1 hour delay in events.

The Entire contents of the JSON file will be stored in the encrypted credential store.


Configure the Admin Reports Inputs
Requires: Audit API Each API endpoint has individual APIs that need to be enabled within https://console.developers.google.com.




For each Report that would like to be consumed, configure a new row for that report. One report per credential per row.


Lookback - this setting will consume that many days back from the API. This is a first-run-to-completion flag only.




Interval - Each report has a slightly different recommended interval.

Please review https://support.google.com/a/answer/7061566 and schedule the input service interval accordingly.









Configure the Admin Usage Inputs
Requires: Admin SDK API Each API endpoint has individual APIs that need to be enabled within https://console.developers.google.com.




For each Report that would like to be consumed, configure a new row for that report. One report per credential per row.


Lookback - this setting will consume that many days back from the API. This is a first-run-to-completion flag only.

Please review https://support.google.com/a/answer/7061566 and schedule the input service interval accordingly.











Usage - User, Customer

These are done at a seconds interval of 86400





Configure the Alert Center Inputs
Requires: Google Workspace Alert Center API #. For each alert center, configure a row in the table to pull the information desired.
 1.  View more information at https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/alertcenter/reference/alert-types .
Configure Classroom Inputs
Requires: Google Classroom API


NOTE: Checking the Write Courses Data checkbox for ANY input will cause the input to write out ALL course metadata each pull. To keep the data down to a reasonable level, only configure 1 input to consume that data.


CourseIDs are a comma separated list of specific course ids. If empty, all will be consumed.


Most, if not all, of these could be fine at a 86400 interval.


Configure Big Query Inputs
Requires: BigQuery API


For GMail Headers: Documentation From Google


Fill out the fields for the project, dataset, table. If all tables are required from a single dataset, enter an asterisk. *




The Ingest Type is one of Row, Query, Time.


Row: is a full pull of the rows from the table. Be careful using on dynamic tables, if any rows are deleted, this will not work as expected.


Query: Place your SQL query in the Enrichment Field column. You can support checkpointing by using ##TIMESTAMP## in the Query String. The timestamp is a 10 digit integer and is based on the last execution time of the input. THIS MAY INCUR COSTS.


Time: This is a very simple query. Uses a checkpoint time, and the Time field that is in the Enrichment Field (iso_time for example). It will consume all fields and columns from the data. THIS MAY INCUR COSTS.


Virtual Row: is a pull of all the rows of VIEW, but checkpointed per vuew. This allows for a virtual table to be pulled while respecting the row counts of the larger table. This should be used with GMail Audit Logs. Dataset and Project required, any VIEWS will be queried and checkpointed. THIS MAY INCUR COSTS.






The Starting Index is a first time only setting. Consumption will start from that row line, and will be checkpointed after first run. This can also be a timestamp for Ingest Types of Time and Query (10 digit)


Highly environmentally dependent for speed of consumption. Work with max_rows setting to determine proper messages per interval. Default is 250,000.


Note: Query, Virtual Row, and Time ingest types are EXPENSIVE. I AM NOT LIABLE FOR YOUR SPENDING.
 Queries (on-demand) $5 per TB The first 1 TB per month is free.
Configure PubSub Inputs
Requires: Cloud Pub/Sub API

Fill out the row with appropriate settings. Work with Max Messages to determine proper messages per interval setting for the environment.

NOTE: Pubsub requires the use of grpcio binaries. Only a many linux x64 file is included with this app. Please follow these instructions if you see any errors with the search: index=_internal log_level=ERROR sourcetype=""google:workspaces:modularinput:pubsub"" error_filename=""ga_pubsub.py"" | stats values(error_*) as error_* by input_guid input_name


Consult The Project Page and download the file that matches Python 3.7 and your filesystem. Download it to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/google_workspace_for_splunk/lib


Cd to that same folder, and execute unzip -n <package>.whl, or an equivalent command on the OS required.


This will install the .so file to the location required for the Scripts to work.


Configure Spreadsheet Inputs


Requires:


Google Drive API


Google Sheets API






Select the credential that you want to use.


Select the Spreadsheet dropdown. This should auto-populate with the spreadsheets that are allowed for the impersonation user configured on the credential.


Select the Sheets (multiple allowed) to consume.

As an Okta customer, your Okta instance captures valuable information regarding user activities, and application access over time – including details about devices, location, browser information, etc.  This app collects data through the Okta platform APIs with the primary focus on system log events.  The app can also present the “latest snapshot” on users, groups and apps.
Out-of-the-box dashboards are provided to give immediate insights on your Okta data based on events.  
Here is a high-level architectural diagram of the integration.

Prerequisite:
Before setting up Splunk App for Okta, the following is needed from an Okta administrator:
An Okta administrator must create an appropriate Okta API key which will be used by the Splunk App to import data from Okta.  The API key should ideally belong to a system user as opposed to an actual “human” user.  A recommended approach is the following:
a.  Create a new Okta user as a dedicated Splunk App account.
b.    Assign the appropriate admin role to give this account the right level of privileges.  If Splunk app is used in a read-only mode without the callbacks to Okta, the account should be given read-only access.  If callbacks are planned, then a higher privileged admin role should be granted.
c.  Remember that an API key should be carefully protected as it can be used in a malicious manner especially when it has access to Okta beyond read-only.
d.  To create an API key
   i.    Log in as the Okta user you intend to associate the API key with.
   ii.   Go to Security->API and create a Token

You can test the API key using the following cURL command:
curl -H ""Authorization:SSWS <token>"" -H “Accept:application/json” -H “Content-type:application/json”  https://<your_okta_org>.okta.com/api/v1/events?startDate=2015-01-01T00%3A00%3A00.000Z&limit=1
The “startDate” and “limit” parameters are optional – but should be considered if your Okta org has been LIVE for some time and contains a large amount of log data.
Installation and Configuration
a.  Install the Splunk Add-on for Okta
b.  Install the Splunk App for Okta 
Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Can I use a read-only API key for this integration
A: Yes.  A read-only API key will suffice for all the out-of-the-box dashboards in Splunk.  However, to leverage the Okta Commands which will modify user status/group membership within Okta, the API key will need to be associated with a user with ""super admin"" privileges.
Q:  Can I associate multiple Okta orgs with a single Splunk App for Okta instance?
A:  Yes. As part of the Splunk Add-on for Okta, each modular input entry can be pointed to a new Okta instance. Just Add as many modular input entries as needed. 
Q:  Is there a dashboard capturing LDAP (non-AD) agent activities?
A:  The out-of-the-box dashboard only supports AD agents.  We will enhance the out-of-the-box dashboard in the future to include generic LDAP agent activities.  However, the data is imported under ""index=okta"".  You can build custom queries/dashboards on top of that.
Q:  As an Okta customer, is SAML supported between Splunk Cloud and Okta (as part of the Okta Application Network)?
A:  This currently being worked on.  Stay tuned.
Q:  It has been more than 24 hours and the data is still coming in.  Is that normal?
A:  The ""24 hours"" window is an estimate.  The time for the initial import really depends on the amount of data that is coming in.  Again, the best gauge is to look at ""index=okta"" and see if the latest event has caught up with the current time.",Version 1.0.1,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/34ef0d00-e6a3-11e8-a33c-02f13bdc2585.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAAFA,"2,413",0,splunk,4,6,Splunk Works,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/splunklabs,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

Deployment
splunk install app snmpmod.spl -update 1 -auth admin:changeme
cd $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/snmpmod
mkdir local
vim local/inputs.conf

SNMP v3
If you are using SNMP version 3 , you have to obtain the PyCrypto package yourself:
As of Python 2.7.9, pip is included with the release.  Run
pip2 install pycrypto


Windows
Copy C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\Crypto to $SPLUNK_HOME\etc\apps\snmpmod\bin
Linux
Copy /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Crypto to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/snmpmod/bin

snmpif Stanza
[snmpif://hostname]
destination = hostname
snmp_version = 3
v3_securityName = username
v3_authKey = password
snmpinterval = 300
interfaces = 1,5,8,9
index = network
# The sourcetype can be whatever you want
sourcetype = snmpif

ipsla Stanza
[ipsla://hostname]
destination = hostname
snmp_version = 3
v3_securityName = username
v3_authKey = password
snmpinterval = 300
operations = 2,7
index = network
sourcetype = ipsla

Response Handlers
destination, host and /etc/hosts
Currently, all response handlers set the Splunk host to the value of destination.  If you don't have DNS (bad sysadmin!) add an entry to /etc/hosts.  I'd be very happy to take a pull request that will look at a host config option and override destination with that value.
SNMP Interface Search Query
I strongly recommend you create a search macro snmpif_traffic that uses streamstats to calculate the bits per second from the raw snmpif data. My macro is:
stats first(*) as * by _time host ifIndex
| streamstats window=2 global=false current=true range(if*Octets) as delta*, range(_time) as secs by host, ifIndex
| where secs>0
| eval bpsIn=coalesce(deltaHCIn, deltaIn)*8/secs
| eval bpsOut=coalesce(deltaHCOut, deltaOut)*8/secs
| eval mbpsIn=bpsIn/1000000 | eval mbpsOut=bpsOut/1000000

Then to call it and display the results as a graph:
index=snmpif host=foo ifIndex=17 | `snmpif_parse`
| timechart bins=500 avg(mbpsIn) as ""Mbps IN"", avg(mbpsOut) as ""Mbps OUT""

And calculate 95th percentile figures
index=snmpif host=foo ifIndex=17 | `snmpif_parse`
| stats perc95(mbpsIn) as ""IN"", perc95(mbpsOut) as ""OUT""

Summary Collection
The search term shown above is quite expensive.  I am running the query above and collecting the data into a new index.
[search index=network sourcetype=snmp_traffic | stats first(_time) as earliest] index=network sourcetype=""snmpif""
| stats first(*) as * by _time host ifIndex
| streamstats window=2 global=false current=true range(if*Octets) as delta*, range(_time) as secs by host, ifIndex
| where secs>0
| eval bpsIn=coalesce(deltaHCIn, deltaIn)*8/secs
| eval bpsOut=coalesce(deltaHCOut, deltaOut)*8/secs
| eval mbpsIn=bpsIn/1000000
| eval mbpsOut=bpsOut/1000000
| fields _time host ifIndex bpsIn bpsOut ifAdminStatus ifDescr ifMtu ifOperStatus ifPhysAddress ifSpecific ifSpeed ifType mbpsIn mbpsOut
| collect index=network sourcetype=snmp_traffic

There is a trick there of using the most recent snmp_traffic event to start the next round of collections.  I run this search every 30 minutes.

So I didn't think the current NMAP app really was all that easy to use to someone new to Splunk and NMAP. There is an official TA-nmap if you prefer. It's in theory better. But this one is easy and doesn't require you to download the whole ES package.
Basically what this does vs the official TA-nmap is actually run the nmap script for you. To add items simply edit scan.sh with a list of your hosts and you'll collect open ports into Splunk.
I borrowed tags from ES/PCI and fields from CIM so should plug right in.
The script in TA-simple-nmap bin generates logs files in /var/log/nmap. Please ensure you have some sort of logrotation in place.
1) dashboards
2) data models
3) CIM
4) App works as TA and SA all in one. Surplus files Splunk will just ignore.
5) Generates a portprofile so you can compare machines quickliy as a summary

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4653,2022-01-09,08:36:46 AM,Ivanti Service Manager Add-On for Splunk,,"Dec. 21, 2021","Overview
Ivanti have developed an integration for ISM and Splunk to provide details of Incident, Service Request and Problem records, as well as providing an alert action for using the ISM REST API to create an incident in ISM. The add-on also supports the creation of a Security Incident in ISM if the Security Operations content package has been installed in the target ISM instance.
This Technology Add-On (TA) requires either an API key (2019.3 or later) or username/password of an account capable of querying the REST API implemented in Ivanti ISM 2018.3 and later.
An accompanying app - the Ivanti ISM App for Splunk (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4654/) provides dashboards that visualise the retrieved data and implement the 3 CIM Ticket Management data sets; incident, change and problem.
Requirements
This TA has been developed and tested against the latest release of Splunk available at the time of development: 8.0.4.1. The inputs should work against Ivanti ISM 2019.2 or later. API key authentication requires ISM 2019.3 or later.
Installation
For ingestion of incident/service request/problem data, install the TA on an instance of Splunk Enterprise capable of running modular inputs. Typically this would be a heavy forwarder or Splunk Cloud-hosted Inputs Data Manager (IDM).
Install the Ivanti ISM App for Splunk (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4654/) on search heads for dashboards and CIM-compliant tagging and field aliases.
For the custom alert action that generates an incident in ISM, install the TA on a search head or search head cluster.
For further guidance around ingestion refer to the Splunk 'Getting Data In' (https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Data/Getstartedwithgettingdatain) or Cloud-focused GDI documentation (https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/latest/Admin/IntroGDI).
Configuration
Configure the TA with the URL of your ISM tenant/server and provide either a) an API key for the ISM Rest API or b) the username and password of a user with appropriate rights in ISM. The Service Desk Analyst role should suffice for both polling tickets and creating incidents
To ingest data from ISM, create inputs for the required business object; incidents, service requests or problems. Configure a polling interval to meet your reporting requirements.
When configuring an alert to generate a new incident, a valid employee LoginID must be provided. It is recommended that a generic account e.g. 'splunk.alerts' or 'security.alerts' be created in ISM, rather than the LoginID of a specific user. Note that the Internal Services account cannot be used for the creation of incidents.
To configure an alert action to generate a Security Incident, check the appropriate checkbox when configuring the alert action. This will cause the TA to create an instance of the new (2020) Security Incident business object rather than the standard Incident object.
Configuration workflow in ISM

Create an API key (recommended over the use of username/password)
If using the TA for alerting, create a generic account to be used for new incidents created from Splunk (recommended over using an existing user account)

Configuration workflow in Splunk - Ingestion

Install the TA
Browse to the TA in Splunk Web and select the Configuration tab, then Add-On Settings
Provide the Tenant URL e.g. https://apacdemo1-try.saasitau.com. Include the protocol (http/https) and port if non-standard
Provide either an API key (e.g. 1A8AE0B10C95FE8C135464F5ED38FBFA) or Username and Password
Provide the Role if not using API key for authentication
Leave the box checked for server certificate verification unless absolutely required e.g. targeting against a test instance with a self-signed cert
Go to the Inputs tab and setup one or more inputs e.g.
Create New Input
Name: acme_ism_incidents
Interval: 600
Index: ISM (any valid Splunk index can be used)
Parameters - leave as the default a different filter is required. The default filter for incidents, for example, queries the state of all Active and Logged incidents
Wait for the first poll then view results by either using the ISM App (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4654/) or searching manually e.g. index=main sourcetype=ivanti:ism:incident

Configuration workflow in Splunk - Alert creation
Create a new alert (Splunk Enterprise) or configure a new alert as an Adaptive Response action in a Correlation Search (Enterprise Security).
Troubleshooting
Use the add-on's UI to configure a logging level of Debug when troubleshooting.
Search using index=_internal sourcetype=""taivantiism:log"" to see errors logged by the ISM TA during ingestion.
Search using index=_internal source=""create_an_incident_in_ism_modalert.log"" to see errors logged by the alert action.

General consideration
This vizualisation requires at least 3 result fields.
Field names are irrelevant.
Coloring options
Coloring is based on the third result field.

Categorical: 3 predefined ranges: success, warning, error.
                 Colors can be changed in Viz options.
Sequential:  Numeric values can be split in color bins.
                 Color range can be defined in Viz options.
None:        Defaults to a beautiful navy blue.

Drilldown options
""Token"" option:
  You can define token name in Viz options.
  Token value can either be 'Node Name' (result field 1 or 2) or
  'Node Value' (result field 3).
""Workflow"" option:
  You can use workflow_actions.conf using ""display_location = field_menu"".
  Field name and value can either be 'Node Name' (result field 1 or 2) or
  'Node Value' (result field 3).
See documentation:
https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Workflow_actionsconf
""Search"" option:

So this is the part of getting data out of Splunk to CMDM, also called discovery.The first integration into the CMDM is focused on ServiceNow CMDB (including relationships), Incidents, Problems, Changes, Users, and Groups. I like to say that this offers a functional integration of ServiceNow with Splunk. As an example one can ask the CMDM to: give me all open incidents for the ServiceNow groups that a particular user belongs to, or give me all servers/hosts that are part of a certain business application. All ServiceNow CMDB/CSDM tables are supported and one can specify which fields/attributes to get over to the CMDM.This CMDM app is not containing the logic/scripts to get information out of ServiceNow and put that into CMDM. For that a separate container is necessary that has access to the internet, to connect to the ServiceNow API, and connects to where the CMDM underlying Neo4j Graph database is located. Please contact the developer for more information.This app also contains a new search command called ""gwriter"" to write Splunk content back to CMDM (Neo4j).To query the CMDM the free ""Neo4j Commands app"" is needed.The CMDM is relying on the popular and most known graph database called Neo4j. The CMDM can work with all of their editions from community to enterprise to SAAS edition.And don't let you discourage by the version of this app as the backend code (ServiceNow part) is ready. This CMDM app is going to have a front-end for the configuration of the back-end.

The dashboards in this app are dependent on the following data models:

As zeromq scales to a massive amount of events and supports a number of queue based design patterns, it seemed logical to use this technology as an input to capture events into Splunk. The add-on uses the pipeline pattern, publisher/subscribe pattern and request/response pattern to implement input gathering. There is also a test program to retrieve data from Splunk and put it on a zero MQ listener. Please read the README.txt carefully to use this add-on as it requires installing zeromq, python (or Java), and the zeromq python module (or zeromq Java binding) before starting.",Version 0.75,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/6b0855de-6900-11e3-b4de-005056ad5c72.png,IT Operations,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,599,0,splunk,0,0,Nimish Doshi,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/ndoshi_splunk,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

This modular input makes an HTTPS request to the GitHub Enterprise's Audit Log REST API endpoint at a definable interval to fetch audit log data.
Prerequisites

Splunk Heavy Forwarder v8.0+
Python 3.7+
GitHub Enterprise Cloud

Installation


Download the latest release from Splunkbase


On a Splunk Heavy Forwarder, go to Apps > Manage Apps.


On the Apps page, click Install app from file, and upload the SPL file you downloaded from Splunkbase. If an existing copy of the app already exists, please check the Upgrade app checkbox.


Generate a Personal Access Token in GitHub Enterprise with the site_admin scope.


Configuration
Personal Access Token Scope
The following are the required scopes for the personal access token allowing the module to fetch the audit log entries successfully:

[x] admin:enterprise Full control of enterprises
[x] manage_billing:enterprise Read and write enterprise billing data
[x] read:enterprise Read enterprise profile data

Input Fields


name


This is name of your instance. You can have multiple modular inputs running simultaneously. However, this is not a recommended behavior for this module.

Takes: alpha-numeric, white spaces and symbol characters

Example: GHE-enterprise-name


Hostname


This is the hostname of your GitHub Enterprise instance. Make sure there are no leading http:///https:// or trailing / in the URL provided. This could either be a FQDN or an IP address. Do not append any paths beyond the tld.


Example: api.github.com


Enterprise


The enterprise name for which to fetch audit log events


Personal Access Token


This is your personal access token that you generate for your or a service account in GitHub Enterprise. This module requires that the personal access token be created with the site_admin scope. This is a very sensitive token so make sure to keep it secure at all times!

Security: The personal access token is encrypted and stored in Splunk's password storage. After you configure it the first time it will be replaced in Splunk's UI with a unique identifier. This identifier will be used by the module to fetch the personal access token before making the API request to GitHub Enterprise.
Takes: a 40 character token

Example: d0e117b6ad471der3rjdowcc401a95d09202119f


Event Types


The audit log contains multiple event types. This field allows you to specify which events to include:

web - returns web (non-Git) events
git - returns Git events
all - returns both web and Git events



More details


Maximum Entries Per Run


The maximum number of events / entries to fetch each time the script runs. To understand how to calculate the maximum number of entries and interval to best fit your organization go to the Tweaking throughput section below.


Verify Self-Signed Certificates


This is a parameter passed to the get() method in the Requests library. If the checkbox is cheked then the SSL certificate will be verified like a browser does and Requests will throw a SSLError if it’s unable to verify the certificate. Uncheck this box if you are using self-signed certificates.


Debug Mode


The personal access token will be leaked in the splunkd logs. DO NOT ENABLE unless you are ready to update your personal access token.


If you are experiencing issues and the module is not operating as intended, you can enable this mode to seethe module's debugging information in the splunkd logs.


Interval


Takes a cron expression as defined in the Splunk docs.

Example: 30 * * * *
At minute 30 of every hour. For example, if you set this CRON job at 11:02, your job will begin running at 11:30, 12:30, 1:30, etc...


Example: */5 * * * *
Every 5 minutes


Example: 300
Every 300 seconds or 5 minutes



Tweaking throughput
This modular input fetches events by calling the Enterprise Audit Log API. This API returns a maximum of 100 events / entries per page. The pagination algorithm can fetch events up to the maximum entries per run defined. It's important to tweak the maximum entries per run and interval parameters to have the ability to fetch your data in a timely manner and stay as close to real-time as possible.
Example:
| Enterprise   | Events per minute | Maximum entries per run | Interval    | API calls used | Guidance                                                                                                                                                               |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Evil-Corp    | 1000              | 1000                    | /1  * | 600 per hour   | The modular input should be able to handle this with ease.                                                                                                             |
| Poizen-Inc   | 5000              | 5000                    | /1  * | 3000 per hour  | We are approaching API rate limit per hour.  Depending on latency, 5000 entries = 50 API calls per minute.  One minute might not be sufficient to fetch all this data. |
| Monsters-Inc | 10000             | 2000                    | /1 ** * | 1200 per hour  | You will be fetching events with a slight delay.                                                                                                                       |
FAQs
How is my Personal Access Token secured?
On the first run the modular input will identify that your personal access token (PAT) is not encrypted. It will encrypt your PAT and store it in Splunk's credentials manager. It will replace the plaintext PAT with an md5 hash of an identifying key.
Your personal access token is only visible in plaintext from the time you configure the modular input instance until the first run.
Does the interval field access only cron syntax?
No, you can enter the number of seconds instead.
I enabled debug mode, what now?
If you've enabled debug mode be ready to change your personal access token because it will most likely be leaked into the Splunk logs in plain text.
Why can't I use a GitHub app instead of a personal access token?
GitHub apps cannot be installed on the enterprise level. The REST API requires enterprise admin privileges which are out of scope for GitHub apps.
Can I use this with GitHub Enterprise Server?
This tool has been designed to consume the Enterprise Audit Log API which is not available for GitHub Enterprise Server because the audit log on the latter can be forwarded via log forwarding directly to Splunk without the need to poll for data.
Support
Support for Github Audit Log Monitoring Add-On for Splunk is run through Github Issues. Please open a new issue for any support issues or for feature requests. You may also open a Pull Request if you'd like to contribute additional dashboards, eventtypes for webhooks, or enhancements you may have.
Troubleshooting
Read logs in Splunk
You can use this search query to fetch all the logs belonging to this module when Debug Mode is enabled.

Test the modular input for syntax problems
Run this test if you don't see anything in the logs (which is a highly unlikely scenario). This will display any syntax errors if there are any.

**Update:
This app is for Splunk v5 and prior.  Try our new app designed to work for Splunk v6 at http://apps.splunk.com/app/1845/. We are accepting user feedback at: Tony.Lee -at- FireEye.com. Thanks!
This app can be installed on Splunk v6 using the instructions found here:  http://securitysynapse.com/2014/05/stopgap-splunk-for-fireeye-v2-app.html
However, this app is designed to work on Splunk 4.3.x and 5.x due to its heavy use of HTML 5 dashboards.  A new app will be written from scratch to take advantage of new Splunk v6 features.
For any help or feedback for this app please post your questions to answers.splunk.com and add the FireEye tag your question
The 1.x versions of this app relied on the syslog data from FireEye devices. The views, dashboards and extractions in the current app rely on the XML output format from FireEye. While the previous version's views and dashboards are included in this app, they have not been tested with the XML data format. If you really want the previous dashboards, we suggest that you not upgrade to version 2.x. OR you can customize the older views to match the fileds based on the XML.
You will have to configure the FireEye to export event via http, xml in order for this app to work. Please see the FireEye Config section below for details. Short version: The http location for the FireEye log forwarding is to be of the form below:
https://localhost:8089/services/receivers/simple?source=FE_test&sourcetype=fe_xml&index=fe
You should replace 'localhost', above with the name of your splunk server. Do Not change the sourcetype or the index parameters above. They will break the dashboards and extractions.
Common Issues
-- There is nothing on the main page.
\- The main overview page is a realtime view. So if you don't have events in the last 5 minutes. The dashboards will be empty
-- The Malware overview page has an empty dashboard for the Business Units impacted
\- The business Unit chart works off a lookup table. You will have to create/use a lookup table that is built for your environment. The lookup table used by default is located at $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/FireEye/lookups/asset_lookup.csv. For more detail on lookup tables please see this link:  
-- Browser hangs on certain searches with very large events. 
\- In very rare cases, for very large events, in excess of 2 Mb. the web browser hangs when attempting to return the event in the Events list.
\- Use the table command to use the table view with specific fields instead of the entire event. e.g. alert_id=1234 | table malware_name src_ip dst_ip
Dependencies
The app requires the following Splunk Apps available from Splunk Base  :
- Splunk for Google Maps
- Splunk for Geo Location Lookup Script
You do not need to install these apps if you do not wish to use the Apps mapping and geo location features. The main dashboard will not render properly without the above apps.
 Installing 
Ensure that the apps listed in the Dependencies section are installed.
Installing via the Web UI :
Go to Manager -> Apps -> Find more apps online: search for fireeye -> Click on the 'Install Free' link below the FireEye app (not the TA-fireeye) -> Ready to install Page -> Install 
Check the Upgrade button if you have an older version installed
Installing from command line:
- Unpack the fireeye.spl file using: tar -vxzf fireeye.spl.
- Move the resulting FireEye directoryinto $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps
- Restart Splunk
 FireEye Config 
You will have to modify your FireyEye's logging configuration to send the
logs to Splunk in xml via http. To do this, on your FireEye appliance, go
to the Settings menu Tab, then Notifications on the left side submenu.
Select http from the Protocol options.
In the HTTP Configuration Server Listing configuration, enter a name value
and click Add HTTP Server. You will see your newly added server name
listed below. Populate the values appropriately:
Server Url :  
ame&sourcetype=fe_xml&index=fe

You must replace the ""SplunkServerIP"" with correct IP of your Splunk
server instance, it is also recommended that you replace
""FireEyeServerName"" with the host name of FireEye MPS system from which
alerts will be sent from.

Auth : Must be checked
Username : Enter your Splunk login username
Password: Enter your Splunk login password
Notifications : Select All Events (recommended)
Delivery : Select Per Event (recommended)
SSL Enable : Must be selected
Message Format : XML Extended ( recommended, but any XML option can be
used)
Lastly, you should disable the syslog or any other notifications to
Splunk; unless you want the notifications ingested twice.
 Source types 
As Splunk indexes your FireEye data, the app will rename the sourcetypes to FireEye_CEF, for the standard syslog, CEF format and fe_xml for the XML data.
In order to get the XML data into Splunk you will have to modify your FireEye appliance by going to the Notifications section in the appliance's web ui, select http and XML for the format. The URL will be of the form below, except replace localhost with the name of your splunk server. You can also replace the source=FE_test with the name you want for your FireEye. The index=fe and the sorucetype=fe_xml should not be changed. the dashboards and views rely on the fe index and the fe_xml source type being present.
https://localhost:8089/services/receivers/simple?source=FE_test&sourcetype=fe_xml&index=fe
 Search macros 
The dashboards rely on the search macros for views. These macros are defined in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SplunkforFireEye/default/macros.conf.
You should only edit the base macros. Base Macros begin with BASE in their name. E.g. BASE-FireEye_index. If you already have data that has been indexed as a different sourcetype, add your sourcetype to the definition. For example:
definition = sourcetype=""fe_xml"" OR sourcetype=""foo"" OR sourcetype=""bar""
Important: All other macros should not be edited.
 Lookups 
Lookups are provided for a sample environment to resolve IP addresses machine hostnames to Users and business units. The lookup will have to be modified to fit your environment.
Using the form fields on the dashboards
All the dashboards work without any filtering values for the form fields. If you want to filter based on a field you should use asterisks before and after the search terms unless you are absolutely sure of the filter value. e.g. you can use 172.168. for IP addresses or Trojan for malware names.
Keep in mind that searches that have longer time ranges may take a little longer to return the results.
 Support and Help 
If you require some help with the app or have questions, please post to answers.splunk.com and add the FireEye tag your question",Version 2.0.8,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/64bd90e2-e1b2-11e3-b0a8-02b791857185.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance",http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,"3,876",0,splunk,4,6,FireEye Splunk,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/fireeyesplunk,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

misp_IPDST, misp_MD5SUMs, misp_SHA1SUMs, misp_SHA256SUMs, misp_URL, misp_Domains



(Non-Cloud Only)
3. Enable the scripted input in inputs.conf.
- By default the scripted input runs every hour. If it is decided to change this interval, and your environment is
clustered, then it is not recommended to use CRON scheduling for the scripted input.
- Confirm the scripted input has run by searching index=_internal ""ExecProcessor"" ""threatlist_handler.py"". If it
successfully ran you will get results back. Ensure log_level is INFO. 
- If you see no results, you can force the scripted input to run by running debug/refresh.
(Cloud Only or Non-Cloud)
3. Enable the Saved Search HLThreatIntelligence Populator to start populating your Threat Lists as 
Scripted Inputs will be removed on Splunk Cloud. 
- It is recommended to schedule the saved search to run hourly as the default retention on the Threat Intelligence Downloads
is set to 1 hour by default. 
- Once the Saved Search has run, you can confirm it is running successfully by running the following search:
index=_internal sourcetype=scheduler savedsearch_name=""HLThreatIntelligence Populator"" | table _time status
- You can also manually run | hlthreatintel to make sure everything works as expected. Errors from running this
search should appear in both the messages window as well as the results output. If no results are returned then
everything should be working as expected.
Upgrading (IMPORTANT)
Upgrading From 1.0.6 or Earlier

Starting in version 1.0.7 the setup process has changed slightly as the setup.xml file has been removed in the default 
folder to meet Splunk Cloud approval. See the Setup Process section in this README.
This app no longer supports anything less than Splunk version 8 as it is required to set the app's Python version to 3 for 
meet AppInspect requirements.

Upgrading From Version 1.0.3 or Earlier
If you are upgrading from 1.0.3 or earlier version you will need to either do one of 
two things as the setup page functionality has changed:
1. Re-enter the API key on the setup page.
- OR -
2. Change the stanza name in the passwords.conf file to be [credential::api_key:]. After a debug/refresh
the new API key should be seen. 
The reason for the above is the app up to version 1.0.3 utilized the standard Splunk setup page which made it
impossible to update an API key while also overwriting the old API key in passwords.conf. This update fixes
this issue, but because of this change one of the above changes needs to be made.
Configure Threat Intelligence Downloads Retention
By default, the retention for the Threat Intelligence Downloads provided in this app are set to -1h. If you adjust
this, consider adjusting the schedule for the scripted input threatlist_handler.py(non-cloud) or saved search 
HLThreatIntelligence Populator (cloud).
You can modify the Threat Intelligence Download settings by going to Configure < Data Enrichment < Intelligence Downloads
in Enterprise Security, and then finding the threat downloads (misp_IPDST, misp_MD5SUMs, misp_SHA1SUMs, 
misp_SHA256SUMs, misp_URL, misp_Domains).
Further information regarding Threat Intelligence Download retention is provided via the Splunk Documentation here: 
https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ES/5.3.1/Admin/Changethreatintel
The above link contains the following information:
Remove threat intelligence from the KV Store collections in Splunk Enterprise Security based on the date that the 
threat intelligence was added to Enterprise Security.

The default maximum age is -30d for 30 days of retention in the KV Store. To remove the data more often, use a 
smaller number such as -7d for one week of retention. To keep the data indefinitely, use a blank field. However, 
if the KV Store collection is stored indefinitely, the .csv files that result from lookup-generating searches can 
grow large enough to impact search head cluster replication performance. If you manually delete the data from the 
.csv file, the maximum age timer does not reset based on the edit date, and the data is still removed from the 
KV Store after the maximum age expires.

If the threat intelligence source is not a TAXII feed, define the maximum age of the threat intelligence. This 
field is not used for TAXII feeds.

- From the Enterprise Security menu bar, select Configure > Data Enrichment > Intelligence Downloads.
- Select an intelligence source.
- Change the Maximum age setting using a relative time specifier.
- Enable the retention search for the collection.
- From the Splunk platform menu bar, select Settings and click Searches, reports, and alerts.
- Search for ""retention"" using the search filter.
- Enable the retention search for the collection that hosts the threat source. All retention searches 
are disabled by default.

Additionally, the Sinkhole option is set to false by default. If you wish to delete the lookups after
they have been added to the Threat Intelligence you will need to enable the Sinkhole for both the Threat Intel Input
as well as the Threat Intelligence Modular Input. 
See corresponding Splunk documentation (Configure threat intelligence file retention):
https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ES/6.1.0/Admin/Changethreatintel#Configure_threat_source_retention\

Proxy Support
As of v. 1.0.4 you can set up a proxy specifically for these feeds. Just modify feed_proxy.conf
Debugging
For detailed logging you can search index=_internal source=""*sa_hlthreatintelligencefeed.log"" which will
tell you if anything goes wrong with either the Scripted Input or Custom Command.
If you use the above search, but see the following: 
[{'type': 'ERROR', 'text': 'Could not find object id=:api_key:', 'code': None}] or a 403 forbidden, and
are upgrading from version 1.0.3 or earlier, then you need to re-enter your API key. 
See the Upgrading section in this README for more information.
Help, I don't see my threatlist!
Once you've configured everything, you should first check to see that your threatlist shows up on the 
""Threat Artifacts"" dashboard in Enterpise Security (Security Intelligence <  Threat Intelligence < Threat Artifacts).
If you do not see your threatlist on the ""Threat Artifacts"" dashboard then it is possible it being omitted as the top
panel specifically (Threat Overview) appends multiple threat intel lists together (file_intel, ip_intel etc.) and
limits the output of those lookups to 10,000 results each. This does not mean your threatlist has not been added.
You can confirm everything is populating as expected by running the following searches:
| inputlookup http_intel | stats count by threat_key
- http_intel will have misp_URLs
| inputlookup ip_intel | stats count by threat_key
- ip_intel will have misp_Domains, and misp_IPDST
| inputlookup file_intel | stats count by threat_key
- file_intelwill have misp_MD5SUMs, misp_SHA1SUMs, and misp_SHA256SUMs
If you still do not see results confirm that the necessary threatintel inputs are enabled in ES:
- Configure < Data Enrichment < Intelligence Downloads

Data types
This app provides the index-time and search-time knowledge for the following types of data from Gigamon Visibility Fabric nodes:
Port Information
- sourcetype = gigamon:api:service:port
Audit Event Information
- sourcetype = gigamon:api:service:audit
Licensing Information
- sourcetype = gigamon:api:service:license
Map Information
- sourcetype = gigamon:api:service:maps
Node Information
- sourcetype = gigamon:api:service:node
Stats Information
- sourcetype = gigamon:api:service:stats
User Information
- sourcetype = gigamon:api:service:users
Traffic Analyzer Data
- sourcetype = gigamon:api:service:traffic
Lookups
Gigamon® Visibility App for Splunk contains several KV Stores.
The KV Stores are descriptive in what they contain:  giga_clusters, giga_fms, giga_ports, giga_cards, giga_maps.
Configure Gigamon® Visibility App for Splunk
The only configuration out of the box is to connect the App with your GigaVUE-FM. You can do this by accessing the Credential Configuration page. It is located on the Menu under Administration -> Configuration Menu Item as GigaVUE-FM.
To change the location of the data from the main index, update the event type giga_idx with the appropriate index name. You must also change the Modular Input configuration to point to the new index.
For syslog and system event dashboards to get populated, individual Gigavue nodes need to be configured to send syslog to the Splunk instance where GigamonApp is installed. Also a data input need to be created on Splunk for syslog to ingest data from Gigamon nodes. 
Troubleshooting
If you find yourself in a situation where the Gigamon® Visibility App for Splunk doesn't work properly, or display the information you thought would be there, here are some simple troubleshooting steps to follow.
1.Start with the Gigamon Visibility App Health dashboard. It is found under the Administration section of the navigation.
1.Check the error sourcetype: sourcetype=GigamonForSplunk:error
1.Check the internal logs: index=_internal source=gigamon
1.Rebuild the lookups: Navigate to the Generate Lookups view under Administration -> Configuration navigation item.

Introduction
The RADAR Alert Action Add-on allows Splunk to create incidents in RADAR.
Requirements
To use the RADAR Alert Action Add-on, you will need a RADAR API token with Incidents Write scope.  You can create a token as a top-level RADAR administrator, or ask your local administrator to provide one for you.
Installation and configuration
To install the RADAR Alert Action Add-on, follow the instructions in the Splunk Add-ons documentation. Once the add-on is installed, perform the following steps:

Sign in to Splunk, click Settings in the top bar, then click Alert Actions. 
Click Setup RADAR Alert Action Add-on in the RADAR Alert Action row.
Create a RADAR API token. If you already have a RADAR API token with Incidents Write scope, skip to the next step.
In a separate tab or browser window, sign in to RADAR, go to the My Account page under the user menu in the upper right, then click the API Tokens tab.
Click Add Token, enter a name, then select the Incidents Write check box under Scopes.
Click Submit. Do not navigate away from this generated token page until you complete the next step; otherwise you will need to generate a new token.


Copy the entire token text, and paste it into the RADAR API token field in the RADAR Alert Action configuration screen. 
Click Save. If the update is successful, you should see a Splunk success message.

Usage
Create an existing alert with the RADAR alert action

In the Search & Reporting app, run a search for your string.
Confirm that the search results look as you expect.
Click the Save As dropdown link above the right side of the search box, then select Alert from the menu that appears.
Enter a title for your alert, along with a description if desired, and configure the standard alert fields related to permissions, scheduling, and trigger conditions according to your needs.
Under Trigger Actions, click + Add Actions, then select RADAR Alert Action.
Enter the incident name and description that you want RADAR to use when the alert is triggered, then click Save.  Your alert will be created, and Splunk will create an incident in RADAR any time it triggers.

Add a RADAR action to an existing alert

In the Search & Reporting app, navigate to the Alerts tab and locate the existing alert.
Click Edit, then select Edit Actions.
Click + Add Actions, then select RADAR Alert Action Add-on.
Enter the incident name and description that you want RADAR to use when the alert is triggered, then click Save. Spunk will now create an incident in RADAR any time the alert triggers.

Advanced usage
Default incident name and description
If you want a different default name or description for an incident, you can change this system-wide setting by manually editing a configuration file and restarting Splunk. 
The default values are defined in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/radar_alert_action/default/alert_actions.conf, but your changes go into the local configuration file that overrides these defaults: $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/radar_alert_action/local/alert_actions.conf. 
If this file does not already exist, create it with contents such as the following:
[radar]

param.radar_incident_name = New default name for created incidents
param.radar_incident_description = New default description for created incidents
Important: Overriding default configuration values will affect any existing alerts that used the previous defaults.
SSL certificate verification
The RADAR Alert Action Add-on uses HTTPS to securely communicate with Splunk and RADAR. Typically, a Splunk instance should be configured with an SSL certificate chain signed by a trusted certificate authority. When configured in this manner, HTTPS requests should succeed without additional configuration or intervention.
If you need to run Splunk and the RADAR Alert Action Add-on on a host without a trusted certificate authority chain, you have two options. Both of these are less secure than the recommended default and should only be implemented if you understand the security implications. The options are described in the following sections, although we strongly recommend taking the time to configure your system securely.
See the Splunk documentation about SSL for more on this topic.
Disabling SSL certificate verification
If you experience SSL certificate verification errors, the most straightforward option is to disable certificate verification. Only use this option if absolutely necessary, as disabling verification will remove a layer of security that is important for secure communications.
To disable certificate verification entirely, set the environment variable RADAR_SPLUNK_SKIP_SSL_VERIFY to any value (such as 1) when starting or restarting Splunk. For example:
RADAR_SPLUNK_SKIP_SSL_VERIFY=1 $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk start
or
RADAR_SPLUNK_SKIP_SSL_VERIFY=1 $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk restart
Once this is done, internal HTTPS requests between the RADAR Alert Action Add-on and Splunk will proceed without certificate verification. This should resolve any SSL-related errors that arise when configuring or using the add-on.
Adding the default Splunk certificates to your system's keychain
Splunk provides a set of default certificates that can be used out of the box. The certificates are self-signed, meaning they are not signed by a trusted certificate authority. Although not as secure as trusted certificates, using the default certificates is an option that can be made to work if for some reason you cannot set up a properly secured certificate and do not want to disable verification entirely.
The process of adding certificates will depend on your system and can be troublesome to get right. Here are some tips that may be useful:

The default Splunk certificates can be found at $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/auth/cacert.pem
Depending on your system, you may need to provide an environment variable to Splunk when starting or restarting to tell Splunk where the certificates can be found. For example, REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/auth/cacert.pem splunk start
If you continue to experience errors in the browser, check $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log for more information. Of course, you can always contact us with any questions and we will do our best to help.

Troubleshooting
Server error when attempting to configure RADAR Alert Action
If you see an error page that displays a 500 Internal Server Error when attempting to access the configuration page for the RADAR Alert Action Add-on, one possible cause is SSL certificate verification failure. You can check
$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunkd.log for diagnostic output to help determine if this is the case. If so, please see the above sections under SSL Certificate Verification for instructions.
If you continue to see 500 errors or other kinds of failure messages in splunkd.log, or are unable to resolve the problem with the instructions in this document, please contact RADAR.
Server error when saving the add-on configuration
When you click Save on the add-on configuration page, the system connects to RADAR to verify the provided API token. If you receive an error, please double-check that your token was set up with the Incidents Write check box selected and that it has been copied and pasted correctly.
Incidents not appearing in RADAR
If expected incidents do not appear in RADAR, check the following to narrow down the problem.
Every attempt to create an incident will be mentioned in $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunkd.log. Check this file to confirm that incident creation is being attempted, keeping an eye out for any errors that may have been logged in case of failure.
It can also be helpful to monitor triggered alerts to confirm whether triggers are happening when expected. You can set this up in Splunk by adding an alert to a list of triggered alerts.
When you add an alert to a list of triggered alerts, you can see records of recently triggered alerts from the Triggered Alerts page or from an Alert Details page.  Any alerts that would have created incidents in RADAR will display here. 
If you continue to experience issues, please contact RADAR and we will be happy to help.

Usage
cipher command syntax: 
cipher mode=<d|e> algorithm=<rc4|rot13|rot47|xor> key=<key> \<field-list>
mode: Mandatory. Set to e to cipher, set to d to decipher the given field list using the provided key.
algorithm: Mandatory. Set to the cryptographic algorithm you would like to use for ciphering/deciphering.
key: Mandatory. Specify the key to use. Requirements vary depending on the chosen algorithm.
Cipher results will be output as hex strings (except ROT results where output is ascii). Deciphering (except ROT operations) expects input fields to be hex strings, results will be output in ascii. If the cipher operation fails on a single field or event, this field/event will be skipped and returned as is.
crypt command syntax: 
crypt mode=<d|e> algorithm=<rsa|aes-cbc|aes-ofb> key=<key_name> \<field-list>
mode: Mandatory. Set to e to encrypt, set to d to decrypt the given field list using the provided key.
algorithm: Mandatory. Set to the cryptographic algorithm you would like to use for encryption/decryption.
key: Mandatory. Set to the name of a key you (or your admin) configured previously.
Encryption results will be output base64 encoded. Decryption expects input fields to be base64 encoded, results will be output in ascii. For security purposes the whole search will fail if the crypto operation fails on a single field or event. See Requirements & Configuration for key setup.
encode command syntax: 
encode mode=<to|from> encoding=<base32|base58|base62|base64|base85|binary|decimal|hex|octal> \<field-list>
mode: Mandatory. Set to to for transforming to the specified encoding, set to from to transform from the specified encoding.
encoding: Mandatory. Set to the encoding method to apply to the given field list.
If the encoding operation fails on a single field or event, this field/event will be skipped and returned as is.
hash command syntax: 
hash algorithm=<md5|sha1|sha224|sha256|sha384|sha512|sha3_224|sha3_256|sha3_384|sha3_512|blake2b|blake2s> [salt=\<salt_name>] \<field-list>
algorithm: Mandatory. Set to the hashing algorithm you would like to use. SHA3 and Blake2 are only available when using Python 3.
saltfile: Optional. Set to the name of a key you (or your admin) configured previously.
For security purposes the whole search will fail if the hash operation fails on a single field or event. See Requirements & Configuration for salt setup.
Examples
XOR the field ""message"" with byte ""\x2f"".
   search sourcetype=""ctf"" | cipher algorithm=xor key=""2f"" message | table _time alice, bob, message
Decode the hex contents of ""payload"" and display readable ascii values in a table.
   search sourcetype=""snort"" | encode mode=from encoding=hex payload | table _time src_ip, dest_ip, payload
Encrypt the values of the plaintext fields ""subject"" and ""content"" of sourcetype ""mail"" using rsa and the key ""public.pem"".
   search sourcetype=""mail"" | crypt mode=e algorithm=rsa key=public.pem subject content
Encrypt raw events of sourcetype ""mail"" using AES-256-CBC and collect the results in a summary index.
   search sourcetype=""mail"" | crypt mode=e algorithm=aes-cbc key=secret.txt _raw | collect index=summary
Decrypt the content of the already RSA encrypted and summary-indexed field ""username"" for output in plain text using RSA. The key file ""private.pem"" is encrypted with AES-256-CBC, so the correspondig password has to be set via the app's set up screen prior to using the key.
   search index=summary sourcetype=""server::access"" | crypt mode=d algorithm=rsa key=private.pem username | table _time action username
Hash a raw event containing some malware threat artifact using sha256.
   search index=threat_intel source=sample.txt | hash algorithm=sha256 _raw
Installation

Just unpack to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps on your Splunk search head and restart the instance. Use the deployer in a distributed environment. Make sure, the app's folder name in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps is TA-cryptosuite (Downloading apps from Github and uploading them to Splunk might result in different folder names).
Assign the roles 'can_encrypt' and/or 'can_decrypt' to users/roles who should be able to encrypt/decrypt data using the crypt command. The cipher, hash and encode commands will automatically be available to all users.
Read and follow the requirements & configuration section below.
Optional: Set python.version=python2 or python.version=python3 in commands.conf, inputs.conf and restmap.conf if you would like to explicitly specify the Python version to use. Otherwise this will be determined by your instance's global settings.
Optional: Change the app's visibility via Manage>Apps or app.conf if you wish. Configuring new keys/salts relies on an internal dashboard though.

Requirements & Configuration
In order for the crypt command of this add-on to be fully usable you'll need to create and upload cryptographic keys. Here's how. You can also find some examples and tips in the examples/ directory.
1.1. If you plan on using RSA, generate a valid RSA key pair (optionally with key encryption) and store it in PEM format.
     Example RSA key pair creation with currently supported parameters using OpenSSL:
         openssl genrsa [-aes256|-des|-des3 -passout pass:password] -out private.pem \<2048|4096>
         openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -RSAPublicKey_out -out public.pem
         Note that using 1024 bit keys is considered unsafe and therefore not supported by the app.
         Important Note: Use of encrypted private RSA keys is only supported when having the ""pycryptodomex"" Python package installed (see below)!
1.2. If you plan on using AES, create a ""key file"".
     Example ""key file"" creation for AES:
         Put your key and IV in UTF-8 into a plain ASCII file. Key has to go on line 1 and IV on line 2.
         The IV's length has to be 16 bytes/characters. The key's length has to be 16/24/32 bytes/characters respectively for 128/192/256 AES encryption. For security purposes 256 bit keys are recommended unless performance is important.

Go to the app's configuration dashboard in your preferred browser. Click ""Create New Input"".

     Name: Enter the name you would like the your key to be accessible through. E.g. the original key file's name.
     Type of Data: Select ""New key"".
     Key/Salt: Copy-paste the contents of your generated key file here. Your key will be stored encrypted in passwords.conf.
     RSA key encryption password: Only required if you are currently configuring an encrypted private RSA key. Supported key encryption algorithms are AES-256-CBC, DES-CBC and DES-EDE3-CBC. Important Note: Use of encrypted private RSA keys is only supported when having the ""pycryptodomex"" Python package installed (see below)!
     Authorized roles: Select which roles you want to grant permissions to use the key. Will be ORed with authorized users. Users/roles will also require the ""can_encrypt"" and/or ""can_decrypt"" role in order to use the crypt command in the first place.
     Authorized users: Select which users you want to grant permissions to use the key. Will be ORed with authorized roles. Users/roles will also require the ""can_encrypt"" and/or ""can_decrypt"" role in order to use the crypt command in the first place.
     Note: For a RSA key pair, you'll have to do this twice. Once for the private key and once for the public key.
If you plan on salting your hashes when using the hash command, create and store upload salts like so:

Go to the app's configuration dashboard in your preferred browser. Click ""Create New Input"".

     Name: Enter the name you would like the your salt to be accessible through.
     Type of Data: Select ""New salt"".
     Key/Salt: Enter or copy-paste your salt here. It will be stored encrypted in passwords.conf.
     RSA key encryption password: Leave empty.
     Authorized roles: Select which roles you want to grant permissions to use the salt. Will be ORed with authorized users.
     Authorized users: Select which users you want to grant permissions to use the salt. Will be ORed with authorized roles.
Note: Handling keys and salts this way is a security feature, since specifing the key/salt directly in a Splunk search directly would make them visible in the _internal index. Keys are not handled like this for the cipher command, as the implemented ciphers are generally not regarded as secure anymore.
On the use of encrypted private RSA keys and used Python libraries: By default the add-on uses a pure-Python implementation of the RSA (and AES) algorithm which comes shipped with the add-on for all platforms. This implementation does not support usage of encrypted private RSA keys. Their usage is only possible by installing the ""pycryptodomex"" Python package to your OS's installation of an instance of Python 3.7.8 or 2.7.17 (see https://www.pycryptodome.org/en/latest/src/installation.html). After the package's successful installation, configure this add-on to make use of the system Python's installed packages via the add-on's configuration page. Unfortunately due to Splunk's built-in Python's poor handling of 3rd party packages, the package cannot be installed to only that instance of Python.
Notes & Restrictions

Attempts to modify _time will be ignored since Splunk always expects a valid _time field.
Wildcards for field names are not supported (yet).
Encryption and decryption of big quantities of data can be ressource intensive operations. Use with caution in old or feeble environments.
Currently only AES-256-CBC, DES-CBC and DES-EDE3-CBC are supported for private RSA key file encryption.
To implement proper key/salt management (without relying on my weak JavaScript skills for a management dashboard) the add-on leverages the comfort Splunk Add-On Builder grants. \
This is why your key/salt configurations are stored as modular input configurations. Don't worry, they are not used as such. A future version of the add-on might implement this better.

(Important) Security Considerations

Granting a user or role the role 'can_encrypt' or 'can_decrypt' needed for usage of the crypt command will also grant them the capability 'list_storage_passwords'. \
This enables the technically savvy user to potentially read more secrets via Splunk's REST API than desirable. \
Unfortunately as of now there is no way around this if the encryption/decryption keys and salts used for this app's function should not be stored in plaintext on disk. \
You can argue this way or that. My assumption is that only high-privileged users will use the crypto functionality in the first place, and thus prefferred encrypted keys over potentially exessive permissions.

The keys and salts you upload are stored encrypted in passwords.conf. However to quote a Splunk blog post: ""[...] Since the encrypted data and the encryption key are stored on the same machine, cryptographically this is equivalent to obfuscation. While some people might argue that this is very weak encryption, it is the best we can do with storing the encrypted data and encryption key on the same machine and it is definitely better than clear text passwords [...]""[0].


The used libraries (see Attribution) have been chosen due to their compatibility with multiple Python versions and OSes. They might not be the best implementations of the respective algorithms and are certainly not the fastest, but more popular implementations posed compatibility challenges due to relying on platform-specific compiled c modules.

The used RSA implementation is only capable of processing so many bytes of data at once during encryption, fields larger than that value have to be split into blocks. This might enable certain attacks on the RSA crypto system. To mitigate the chances of a successful attack, random padding (PKCS#1 v2 (OAEP)) is used and can not be disabled in this version of the add-on.
Using 1024 bit RSA keys is generally considered unsafe and therefore not possible using with the add-on.

I chose AES-CBC and AES-OFB as the only available modes as they offer the best balance between performance and security for the purposes of this add-on.


It is not recommended to use MD5 or SHA1 for security purposes (e.g. storing password hashes) since these hashing algorithms are not regarded as safe anymore.

It is not recommended to use the ciphers provided through the cipher command for security purposes (e.g. storing safely encrypted data) since these algorithms are not regarded as safe anymore.
SHA3 and Blake2 are only available when using Python3 as your environment's interpreter.

| array2object field=_raw path=""<path>"" key=""<relative path>"" value=""<relative path>""
Paths are expressed in dot notation, including when entering arrays. For example, event[0].key needs to be written as event.0.key.
field
Optional, defaults to _raw
Splunk field containing the JSON data to parse.
path
Mandatory
The path from the root of the JSON object to the array. Must point to an array, and must be written in dot notation eg event.AuditKeyValues.
key
Mandatory
The relative path from the array, to the value which will be used as the key for each array item. Ideally the value of this field would be unique but the command will create multivalue fields if there is overlap.
value
Optional, defaults to all children except the key
The relative path from the array, to the value(s) of the new field. Typically used to set the output to a single value like ""ValueString"", but accepts a relative path, and all children from the path will be added.
Example
CrowdStrike's EventStream data contains an array of objects called AuditKeyValues, where each member contains a object with the keys ""Key"" and ""ValueString"". From the root of the JSON object, this arrays path would be ""event.AuditKeyValues"" in dot notation.
""event"":{
  ""AuditKeyValues"":[
    {""Key"":""actor_cid"",""ValueString"":""abcdef1234567890""},
    {""Key"":""target_user"",""ValueString"":""brett.whynot@gmail.com""}
  ]
}
Using the array2object command will create new fields using the value of the key for each of the arrays objects:
| array2object path=""event.AuditKeyValues"" key=""Key""
event.AuditKeyValues.actor_cid.ValueString = ""abcdef1234567890""
event.AuditKeyValues.target_user.ValueString = ""brett.whynot@gmail.com""
When there is only a single value expected (key value pairs), you can specify the value path to get shorter field names:
| array2object path=""event.AuditKeyValues"" key=""Key"" value=""ValueString""
event.AuditKeyValues.actor_cid = ""abcdef1234567890""

Mainframes power mission-critical applications around the world. But many organizations are still flying blind, with no easy way to derive operational intelligence from the vast amounts of machine data generated by these critical systems.
It’s time for data streams from the mainframe to be as accessible as your other data streams when it comes to analytics for business intelligence and security monitoring.
Syncsort Ironstream enables you to collect and forward z/OS log data, including security data, into Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Enterprise Security, where you can get that true 360-degree view.
Users can then easily search, analyze, and visualize the data for powerful business intelligence reporting -- without needing specialized expertise and different monitoring systems for z/OS.
Make more sense of the massive machine data piled up in your mainframe.

Avi Networks is the Intent-Based Application Services Platform that automates elasticity and intelligence across any cloud. Avi provides a Software Load Balancer, Intelligent Web Application Firewall (iWAF) and Elastic Service Mesh to ensure a fast, scalable, and secure application experience. Customers enjoy 90% faster provisioning and 50% lower TCO. 
Avi Networks Splunk Add-on
The Avi Networks Splunk add-on provides inputs for defining sourcetypes, CIM compliant aliases and search time field extractions for three different sources of data from the Avi Controller; Events, Virtual Service Logs and Performance Metrics.
Avi Events
Events are used throughout Avi as an audit trail of what happened when.  Events such as user logins, configuration changes and runtime state changes are all tracked as events.  
https://avinetworks.com/docs/latest/alerts-overview/
https://avinetworks.com/docs/latest/alert-actions/
https://avinetworks.com/docs/latest/notifications-overview/
Getting Events into Splunk requires configuration changes made on the Avi Controller.  To send Avi events into Splunk configure your alert-actions within the Avi Controller to send syslog messages with a destination endpoint being your Splunk infrastructure.
Virtual Service Logs
Virtual Service logs provide realtime in depth L7 application data for each request. The Virtual Service Logs are sent as a JSON payload over UDP.   
https://avinetworks.com/docs/latest/architectural-overview/applications/virtual-services/vs-logs/
https://avinetworks.com/docs/latest/streaming-avi-logs-to-external-server/
Getting Virtual Service Logs into Splunk requires configuration changes made on the Avi Controller.  To send Avi Virtual Service Logs into Splunk configure your anayltics profile to Stream to an External Server, defining your Splunk infrastructure as the server endpoint.
Performance Metrics
Avi provides over 200+ metrics allowing you to monitor not only the peformance of Avi as a service, but granular visibility or specific applications and backend pool servers.
A Scripted Data Input named Avi Metrics is included with the Splunk add-on.  The Avi Metrics Data Input will connect to the specified Avi Controller(s) via the REST API and retrieve the performance metrics. To get performance metrics into Splunk add a new entry within the Avi Metrics data input specifying the Avi Controller cluster and relevant credentials.  The default interval for the scripted input to run is every 5 minutes.
https://avinetworks.com/docs/latest/metrics-list/
Setting up the Avi Networks Splunk App
Recommended Avi versions are 17.2.8 and up.  Any version of Avi 17.2 will work, just know that for the performance metrics specifically there will be a few empty graphs for prior versions.  Controller performance metrics were added in 17.2.5 and the per Service Engine Virtual Service metrics will work 17.2.8 and after.
The only other configuration required within the Avi Networks Splunk add-on itself is for adding entries in the Avi Metrics scripted input to retrieve performance metrics if desired.
The Avi Networks Splunk Add-on should be installed on the search heads, indexers and if they exist; heavy forwarders.  
The Avi Metrics scripted input should be configured to run on a heavy forwarder if one exists, otherwise on a search head.
Analytics
Avi provides end-to-end timing to troubleshoot issues in minutes, end guesswork and reduce time to resolution. Avi assigns health scores for each service based on network monitoring, application performance metrics, logs and security events. Avi Analytics drive actionable insights that make auto scaling seamless, automation intelligent and decision making easy.
Automation
100% API based architecture allows self-service provisioning and integration into the CI/CD pipeline for application delivery. Avi is intent-based by automating the heavy liftings and simplifying end user experience. Avi provides a variety of automation options including Python/GO SDK, RESTful APIs, turn-key integrations with Ansible, Terraform, Grafana, Splunk and Slack.",Version 1.0.26,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/c6ece80c-537a-11ec-8e19-7aeef9beb3b0.png,"IT Operations, DevOps",https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/,815,0,splunk,3,1,matt Karnowski,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/mkarnowski,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

A Splunk app to provide insight into index state

This application is aimed at helping administrators understand the current
state of their index, as it relates to disk footprint, and the retention
settings for the index.
Due to changes in the operation of dbinspect introduced in Splunk 6.0, as well
as changes to the application packaging, this app by itself is no longer
sufficient to collect data for a standalone system. The TA-fire_brigade
application will also be required, to act as the data collection source.
In a distributed environment, the TA-fire_brigade app will also be required.
In small environments, a single installation of the TA on the search head can
collect data from all of the indexers. In larger installations, however, the
TA should be installed on all indexing nodes, and not on the search head.
The TA (and a saved search within the full app) collects data using the
dbinspect search command. This detail of the constituent buckets in the index
is used to drive several visualizations about the state of the index.
Compatibility
The output from the dbinspect command changed in version 6.0. This app is
specifically tuned for version 6.0 and higher. If you're running Splunk 4.3 or
Splunk 5.x, use TA-fire_brigade version 1.
Thanks and Acknowledgements
Thanks to all of the sites that tested early versions of the application. My
colleagues were helpful in getting the application to a wider audience, as
well as providing critical feedback in improving the dashboards.

Next Generation and Datacenter Firewalls
Overview
Fortinet FortiGate Add-On for Splunk is the technical add-on (TA) developed by Fortinet, Inc.  The add-on enables Splunk Enterprise to ingest or map security and traffic data collected from FortiGate physical and virtual appliances across domains. The key features include: 
•    Streamlining authentication and access from FortiGate such as administrator login, user login, VPN termination authentication into to Splunk Enterprise Security Access Center
•   Mapping FortiGate virus report into Splunk Enterprise Security Endpoint Malware Center
•   Ingesting traffic logs, IPS logs, system configuration logs and Web filtering data etc. 
Fortinet FortiGate Add-On for Splunk provides common information model (CIM) knowledge, advanced “saved search”, indexers and macros to use with other Splunk Enterprise apps such as Splunk App for Enterprise Security. 
Dependencies
If used with apps that are based on CIM, Splunk Common Information Model Add-on will need to be installed.
Please make sure FortiGate FOS version is 5.0 or later.
Configuration Steps
Install Fortinet FortiGate Add-on for Splunk on search head, indexer, forwarder or single instance Splunk server:
Note: There is a 3rd party add-on for Fortinet named Fortinet Fortigate with FortiOS 5 Add-On with folder name TA-fortinet, which has conflict with Fortinet FortiGate Add-on for Splunk, so you need to disable the 3rd party add-on before you proceed.
There are three ways to install the add-on:

Install from Splunk web UI: Manage Apps->Browse more apps->Search keyword “Fortinet” and find the add-on with Fortinet logo->Click “Install free” button->Click restart splunk service.
Install from file on Splunk web UI: Manage Apps->Install from file->Upload the .tgz file which is downloaded from https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps ->check the upgrade box-> click restart splunk service.
Install from file on Splunk server CLI interface: Extract the .tgz file->Place the Splunk_TA_fortinet_fortigate folder under $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps-> Restart Splunk service.

Add data input on Splunk server:
Note: From version 1.2, the Splunk TA(Add-on) for fortigate no longer match wildcard source or sourcetype to extract fortigate log data, a default sourcetype fortigate_log is specified in default/props.conf instead, please follow the instruction below to configure your input and props.conf for the App and TA(Add-on).
Through Splunk Web UI:
Settings->Data Input->UDP
Port: 514 (Example, can be modified according to your own plan) 
leave other parameters as is.
Note: the UDP port, 514 in this example should be opened in firewall for logs to pass through. If you choose TCP input and on FortiGate use ""reliable""(tcp) mode for syslog setting, you will need to add the following in local/props.conf because tcp tranported syslog will have xxx <yyy> header as line indicator.(8514 below is an example of TCP port, you can choose your own. There is no timestamp header like UDP so you can specify the timestamp field in the fortigate log, in our case the precision is in nanoseconds so the time format is %s%9N. If your FOS version has time stamp in different precision, refer to: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.1.1/SearchReference/Commontimeformatvariables)
[source::tcp:8514]
SHOULD_LINEMERGE = false
LINE_BREAKER = (\d{2,3}\s+<\d{2,3}>)
TIME_PREFIX = eventtime=
TIME_FORMAT = %s%9N
If you are forwarding FortiGate logs from Fortianalyzer, please make sure you set the format to syslog instead of the default CEF format.
Fortinet FortiGate Add-On for Splunk will by default automatically extract FortiGate log data from inputs with sourcetype 'fortigate_log'. 
If you want to configure it to extract a self-defined sourcetype, copy the props.conf 
in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Splunk_TA_fortinet_fortigate/default/props.conf to 
$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Splunk_TA_fortinet_fortigate/local/props.conf and change the source stanza.
replace [fortigate_log] with [fortigate], for instance.
Restart Splunk service for the change to take effect.
Verify the Add-on in Enterprise Security App

This app relies on Splunk Add-on for Salesforce to index structured and unstructured data from your Salesforce instance over the REST API. Please install download this addon from https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3549/ and make sure you go through its documentation.
Data Collected by the Addon:


The unstructured data is coming from the Salesforce Event Log File API. This API needs to be enabled on your instance and it is not enabled by default. For any questions about this API, please contact your Salesforce admin or Salesforce sales rep. for the same. For more information on the Event Log File API, please refer to the following link: 
Salesforce release notes


The structured data is mainly used for enriching the log events via lookups. This data is collected over REST API as well by periodically running SOQL queries. The poll frequency is configurable as needed


You can watch a short demo video of the App here Splunk App for Salesforce Video
For Frequently asked question, please refer to the bottom of that page
Architecture
The following diagram represents the logical architecture of the Splunk App for Salesforce:

Deployment in Distributed Environments

Install and configure the add-on on a Heavy-Weight Fowarder or equivalent. For configuration steps, please check the ""configuration"" section
Install the Add-on on Search head
Install the Splunk App for Saleforce on Search Head. Enable the saved searches highlighted on the configuration step 

Pre-requisite


Enable the Salesforce Event Log File API
The Splunk App for Salesforce relies on the Event Log File API to access the Salesfoce log data. This API is not enabled by default. 
Common use cases of this API include tracking user activity, user feature adoption, and troubleshooting issues that may arise in your Salesfoce environment, and many others.
For more information please refer to the following Link: 
Event Log File API
Please contact your Salesforce admin or rep. to get access to the Event Log File API.


Salesforce Service Account
In order to collect the data from Salesforce, Splunk App for Salesforce requires a Salesforce user to be created with the following permission: 

API Enabled
Read access to the following Salesforce objects: Event Log File, Report, Dashboard, User, Opportunity, Account and loginHistory
If you want Splunk to write alerts to a chatter group, the user needs to have write access to the Salesforce Chatter group as well. 
In order to connect over the REST API, the Salesforce user needs to have the Security Token Associated with it. If you do not have the security Token, use the instrcutions on the following link: 
Reset Security Token 



Validate that you have the right access
Login to Workbench by accessing the following URL: link 
Select Jump to “SOQL Query”
And object set to “Account”

On the next screen make sure you have access to the following Objects (under the Object drop down list): 
Account

User
Report
Dashboard
EventLogFile
LoginHistory
Opportunity


Configuration

After you have installed the Add-on, go through the add-on steps for configuring data collection. For more details, please refer to: http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/Salesforce/About.
After you have configured your Salesforce account from the ""Configuration"" tab of the add-on, go to the ""Inputs"" tab and create and configure the ""Salesforce Event Log"" input. 
The add-on comes with 6 inputs of type ""Salesforce Object"". These inputs are: Loginhistory, opportunity, account, user, report and dahsboard. Edit each one them to select the account to be used for authentication and theenvironment type (Sandbox or Production) and paste the token.
Enable all 6 of the inputs that you have edited on step#3
Please allow the Splunk App for Salesforce some time for the data to come in. After letting the app collect the data for few hours, please run the following searches manually to build the lookup tables. This can be done by going to Settings -> Searches and running the 4 following searches one at a time: 
Lookup - ACCOUNT_ID TO ACCOUNT_NAME - comes with the Splunk App for Salesforce
Lookup - OBJECT_ID to OBJECT_NAME - comes with the Splunk App for Salesforce
Lookup - OPPORTUNITY_ID TO OPPORTUNITY_NAME - comes with the Splunk App for Salesforce
Lookup - USER_ID to USER_NAME - comes with the Splunk Add-on for Salesforce

Deprecated - Feeding Data to Salesforce
This command has been removed and deprecated from App

Meaning you can target different apps for outputs and read the resulting HTML file from any app. First you'll want to get the map functioning properly in here before trying to port it to another app. For feedback or questions you can reach me at will@splunk.com.

The ssdeep project (http://ssdeep.sourceforge.net) allows to create fuzzy hashes, which turn to be useful for malware analysis. Unlike sha, md5 etc. it is not creating a whole new string when a single element has changed. It is a quick and neat way to compare two files etc.
This addon is here to provide lookups from your Splunk data, as well as your local files to create fuzzy hashes, and compare them.
Examples
Hashing the content of the field ""foobar"":
* | `ssdeep_hash_buf(foobar)`
Hashing the content of the file ""/tmp/foo"" on your filesystem:
* | eval filename=""/tmp/foo"" | `ssdeep_hash_filename(filename)`

A simple if-this-then-that workflow app to share Splunk alert and results
Simple to install, configure and run
This app is bundled together with a sample Splunk saved search that searches on failed login events. The search is triggered every 1 minute and looks for matching events in the relative past 1 minute

INSTALLATION STEPS

If you are installing this app manually, ensure this app is unpacked in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps
Go to the following Splunk app endpoint /manager/routr/apps/local/routr/setup?action=edit
Update the setup form with the appropriate oauth and access token credentials and click Save button
Verify that the scripts tweetalert.py or tumblralert.py is moved to $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/scripts accordingly if you configure either Twitter or Tumblr credentials
To confirm that this app has been successfully installed, simply copy the URL of your Splunk instance and load it in another browser. Then try with erroneous Splunk credentials in the login page
Go to your Twitter account page and you should see a tweet within a minute.
If you have configured your Tumblr credentials, go to your Tumblr page and you should see a Tumblr post

HOW TO USE THIS APP

Use tweetalert.py or tumblralert.py in the Alert actions when you create any Splunk Saved Search so that the alert will be posted as a tweet. To do this, Enable a script and provide the file name tweetalert.py or tumblralert.py in the Alert actions

HOW TO TROUBLESHOOT

Go to $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/routr.log This log file contains application specific information

Once you have this information, you will be able to perform a wide array of evaluations against your data.  For instance, you can calculate how close together two mailing addresses are.
To prove out that this can be done in Splunk, we are using a large data set of addresses from the National Center for Educational Statistics:
            http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubschuniv.asp

This is a complete listing of all public elementary and secondary schools in the country from 2014 - 2015.
Changes to Splunk:
This App will install a two indexes:
addresses
Will be loaded with a base of address information.  You can put your data here.

geolocation
Stores the output from the scripted API query, including status.

Getting started:
Create the geolocation_lookup KV store with this search against your address data,  OVER ALL TIME :
index=""addresses"" | eval cust_lat=""DNE"" | eval cust_lon=""DNE"" | eval location_type=""DNE"" | eval in_reconciliation=""no"" | rename NCESSCH AS cust_id, SCHNAM AS cust_name, LSTREE AS cust_street, LCITY AS cust_city, LSTATE AS cust_state, LZIP AS cust_zip | table cust_id cust_name cust_street cust_city cust_state cust_zip cust_lat cust_lon location_type in_reconciliation | outputlookup geolocation_lookup

You can validate your KV Store with this search:
| inputlookup geolocation_lookup

If you needs to delete a KV Store and start over, run this command from the CLI:
curl -k -u admin:changeme -X DELETE https://localhost:8089/servicesNS/nobody/physical_address_to_geolocation/storage/collections/data/reconcile

Configuration:
You will need to update the address_to_lat_lon.pl script located in the bin directory.  Read through the script to understand what it is doing and how to obtain a Google API key.
After that, you will need to copy the script to $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/scripts/ dir.  
How it works:
There are two KV stores:
geolocation_lookup - stores all address information.  Unknown values are populated with DNE (does not exist).

reconcile_lookup - stores information for all addresses that are returned by the API, when the number of results is greater than one.

A search is scheduled every 15 minutes to check the geolocation_lookup for missing information (DNE).  When that condition is met, it triggers the script that runs an API query to obtain the geolocation information.  The results of the API query determine what happens to that data.  
Known Issues:
I am still working out the best way to delete items from the reconcile_lookup after reconciliation.  The only way to delete a KV store record is to use the API.  This means that I will most likely have to write a custom command that calls the API to achieve this properly.  
Installation:
First install this App on your Search Head(s).  Next, migrate the index configuration to the indexing tier and restart Splunk.
Dashboards:
Physical Address to Geolocation - Displays all of the addresses that have Lat/Lon set in the Geolocation KV Store.
Geolocation KV Status - Shows the progress and status of the Geolocation KV Store.
Reconcile KV Status - Shows the progress and status of the Reconcile KV Store.
Reconcile Records - Used to reconcile records that have more than one address returned from the API.
Script Status - Analysis of the script output.

About
The Jira Issues Collector Client hosts the Javascript code and html button for a Jira Issue Collector popup UI in a Splunk Enterprise dashboard.
Usage
The Jira Issues Collector Client dashboard provides a host for the Javascript code and html button for a Jira Issue Collector popup user interface (UI). A KVStore collection is used to store the configuration (i.e. the button title, button label, and url to Jira Issue Collector javascipt code for the popup UI).
Configuration needed after initial installation
The app's configuration is stored in the jira_icc_collection_lookup KVStore collection, and no configuration is included with the initial app installation.

Create configuration<
The app's configuration is stored in the jira_icc_collection_lookup KVStore collection. To create a configuration, execute the following search with appropiate vaules:
| makeresults | eval Timestamp = now(), 
ic_title=""Click button to open Jira Isssue Collector Client"", 
ic_label=""Create Request"", 
ic_url=""https://your.atlassian.host.url/path.to.jira.javascript""
| outputlookup jira_icc_collection_lookup append=t

Read configuration
To read/view the configuration, execute the following search:
| inputlookup jira_icc_collection_lookup

Update configuration
To update the configuration, execute the following search with appropiate vaules:
| inputlookup append=t jira_icc_collection_lookup
| eval Timestamp = now(), 
ic_title=""Click button to open Jira Isssue Collector Client"", 
ic_label=""Create Request"", 
ic_url=""https://your.atlassian.host.url/path.to.jira.javascript""
| outputlookup jira_icc_collection_lookup append=t

Delete configuration
To delete the configuration, execute the following search:
| outputlookup jira_icc_collection_lookup</code></pre>

After configuration completed
After the configuration is completed, use the Jira Issue Collector by clicking on the ""Jira Issues Collector Client"" dashboard link. Then, click button on dashboard to open Jira Issues Collector UI.

Jira Issues Collector UI
Enter data into the Jira Issues Collector UI and click Submit button.

Security

Like any app, the level of security has a dependence on the environment used to host the app. So, it is suggested that the dependenices be updated periodically with their respective security patches/fixes.
Jira Issue Collector popup UI is created by the Jira Issue Collector Javascript code; so refer to the Jira documentation for info about data input validation for the popup UI.
No data input validation is done for the app's configuration; so it is recommended that write access to the jira_icc_collection_lookup KVStore collection be limited to Splunk admins.
If you have suggestions to improve the security of the app, please contact support.

Dependencies

The Jira Issues Collector Client app was developed on a Linux OS VM (CentOS) with a Splunk Dev environment. Due to limited resources, no development/testing at all was done against the Splunk Windows OS environment, but it is expected to work with Windows OS.
The Jira Issue Collector Javascipt code requires JQuery which is included with a Splunk Enterprise installation.
The Chrome web browser was used to develop the Jira Issues Collector Client. No testing/development was done with other web browsers.

Limitations and/or Known Issues

Only 1 Jira Issues Collector can be configured at this time; so only the first record that is returned by a search of the KVStore configuration is rendered on the dashboard.
This app only supports the Jira Issue Collector on the included dashboard. However in the future, it may be that a custom Splunk Enterprise visualization object could be developed to allow a Jira Issue Collector be added to any dashboard.

| expandurl field=<string> [redirect_limit=(<# of times to expand a daisy redirect of shortened links>)]
field: the name of the field containing the short URL.
redirect_limit: Defaults to 0, meaning redirects are not followed. Some short URLs will lead to other short URLs, which lead to other short URLs, etc. ""redirect_limit"" allows you to follows these redirects while specifying the max # of redirects to follow (avoiding an endless loop). This field is not required.
NOTE: The ""expandurl"" command works best if you narrow your search results to only URLs masked by shortening services. This can be done easily with a lookup table.

Output
expandurl will produce a new field for each row named ""expanded_url"".
Sample:
url,expanded_url
http://bitly.com/[short_link1], http://someexpandedurl1.com/stuff
https://goo.gl/[short_link2], http://anotherlongurl.com/stuff2

Examples
Example 1: Expand short URLS, don't follow redirects
index=your_index [inputlookup short_services.csv | return 10000 $short_service] | expandurl field=url | table url, expanded_url
In this example, short_services.csv is a lookup table containing a list of shortening services like ""tiny.cc"", ""ow.ly"", ""bitly.com"", etc. This narrows the search results. You should provide this table. 
The expandurl command is applied to the ""url"" field of every row, outputting a new field named ""expanded_url"".
Example 2: Expand URLs and follow up to 3 redirects
index=your_index [inputlookup short_services.csv | return 10000 $short_service] | expandurl field=url redirect_limit=3 | table url, expanded_url
In this example, short_services.csv is a lookup table containing a list of shortening services like ""tiny.cc"", ""ow.ly"", ""bitly.com"", etc. This narrows the search results. You should provide this table. 
The expandurl command is applied to the ""url"" field of every row, outputting a new field named ""expanded_url"". If the URL leads to a daisy chain of redirects, up to 3 redirects will be followed (hence the redirect=3 attribute).

Lookup Table
As stated above, it is best to narrow your search results by matching on a list of URL shortening services. Here is a look uptable you can upload as ""short_services.csv"" for use with the examples above:

The Splunk App for NSS Labs CAWS enables consumers of the CAWS API to simply injest CAWS threat and device efficacy into Splunk and view this data using helpful charts and KPI panels.  Users can also integrate CAWS organization statistics and KPIs into custom dashboards using various saved searches.
Features
1. NSS Labs' CAWS API Data Modular Input
Allows Splunk users to receive threat details and device efficacy notifications from NSS Labs' Cyber Advanced Warning System.  Event sourcetypes are caws:threat and caws:bypass.
Notes About Modular Input Data

sourcetype=caws:threat - Results provide details about threats found in the wild.  Please see the full documentation for information on how fields are aliased to the Splunk CIM Malware_Attack model.
sourcetype=caws:bypass - Results provide basic details about threats that bypassed a security product in a CAWS Profile.  Data can be joined to caws:threat events using the NSSId field.

2. CAWS Metrics/KPI Saved Searches
Allows the querying of an organization’s statistics/KPIs in Splunk using custom search commands and saved searches.  These saved searches are scoped to the application by default.  Please see Searches, reports, and alerts under the Settings menu or the full documentation for more detail.
3. Dashboards
Splunk for CAWS includes several simple dashboards to provide users with examples of the data provided by the modular inputs, custom search commands, and saved searches.
Requirements
The application requires access to the CAWS API with integration features enabled.
Gettting Started
After installing the app, it can be configured using its setup page.  This will configure a default NSS Labs’ CAWS API Data modular input and securely store CAWS API credentials to allow the included custom search commands to authenticate against the CAWS API.
Note:  If users chose to manually configure the NSS Labs’ CAWS API Data modular input, the password will be encrypted and masked automatically when events are streamed for the first time.

uberAgent consists of two main components: the actual agent runs on the endpoints you want to be monitored, sending the data it collects to the configured backend either directly or via Splunk's Universal Forwarder. The second main component, implemented as a set of Splunk apps, provides dashboards, visualizations, searches, and reports.
The Agent
uberAgent's data collecting component is a lightweight agent that runs independently of any runtimes or frameworks. The agent's footprint is so small that it is truly unobtrusive on the monitored endpoints and does not affect user density.
Where other products rely on operating system sources such as performance counters, WMI, or similar unfiltered data, uberAgent comes with its own metrics. Instead of raw data uberAgent gives you information that matters (see uberAgent's list of metrics).
The agent is highly configurable: metrics can be turned on or off individually, the data collection frequency can be chosen freely, blacklists and whitelists (supporting regular expressions) allow for fine-grained control. This ensures that only data you really need is sent to the backend for indexing.
Browser Extensions
uberAgent's endpoint agent is complemented by browser extensions, which enable uberAgent to collect performance and usage metrics from web apps, too. Extensions are available for all major browsers.
The Splunk Apps
Multiple Splunk apps help process and visualize the data collected by the agent. The indexer app lives on Splunk indexers and mainly creates uberAgent's index and data input. Dashboard apps implement the user interface, providing different views into the collected data. uberAgent comes with two dashboard apps: one for uberAgent UXM and another for uberAgent ESA.
uberAgent's main apps are complemented by special-purpose apps that offer a different view of the existing uberAgent data, such as the uberAgent Helpdesk app.
Most dashboards are searchable and have extensive filtering capabilities to give you a fast and powerful way of isolating specific data. Time range pickers make it easy to go back to the exact time a problem occurred.
uberAgent makes full use of Splunk's advanced UI components to display a beautiful user interface that fluidly adapts to screen width and device type. As a result, it works equally well on a tablet as on a PC or Mac.

    The Encrypted Credentials visualization allows you to seamlessly interact with the Encrypted Credentials store within Splunk, right from a simple xml dashboard.

NOTE - THIS IS IMPORTANT
The use of this visualization requires a user to have the encrypted_credentials role, which is a custom role included within the visualization. This role grants the user access to the admin_all_objects capability. This role was separated from the admin role as a way of differentiating who has access to the visualization. 
ONLY ASSIGN THIS ROLE TO THOSE USERS WHOM YOU TRUST WITH ADMIN PRIVILEGES.
Configuration
The Encrypted Credentials visualization has very few options. 


Realm
    The realm setting is an optional field.


Username
    This is the username to be created for the credential set.


Password
    This is the password to be associated with the username being created. Ensure it aligns with the best practices established within your organization.


Debug

JavasScript Logging
yes, no
This controls if debug logging should be enabled for the view.



The Only Search

| makeresults

To use this visualization the | makeresults search must be performed. Once you have results, then select the Encrypted Credentials visualization. That is all to do.

Anomali ThreatStream App for Splunk empowers Splunk users to leverage threat intelligence to detect, prioritize, and response to security incidents. It provides Splunk users with threat data collected and curated from industry leading threat intelligence platform ThreatStream to correlate with your log data in Splunk, detect malicious activities in incoming and outgoing traffic, alert security teams, and provide you with detailed contextual information from a variety of threat sources (open source, commercial, Anomali Labs, customer internal, etc.). Moreover, the App has built-in Splunk Adaptive Response actions, automating security and threat investigation workflow to reduce investigation time and enable a rapid, decisive response.
Features:

Interaction with the ThreatStream platform for automatic threat data updates
Dashboards detailing event data associated with the known indicators of comprise (IOCs)
Intuitive visualization tools for rapid detection and prioritization of security incidents
Automatic alerting on critical indicator matches
Adaptive Response actions automating the security and threat investigation workflow

Prerequisites:

Linux or Windows Operating System
ThreatStream account
An internet connection from your Splunk Enterprise instance to access threat data from ThreatStream, or a connection to an Anomali Integrator instance

Install:

Login to Splunk as an admin.
Go to Apps->Manage apps
Click Install app from file.
Browse to the file folder with the app .tar.gz file.
Choose the file and click OK.
After the app is uploaded and installed, restart Splunk.

Distributed Setup:
The ThreatStream App for Splunk should only be installed on Splunk Enterprise Search Heads. An index entry will need to be created on a Splunk Indexer Cluster for the threatstream_summary index.
Upgrading to v6.4.1:
Due to changes in the way that we process macros, an additional upgrade step is required for all Splunk App installations upgrading to this version.

Backup the currently installed app local folder
Install the App via the UI or through the file system
Remove the local/macros.conf file
Re-instate the definitions for the ts_drilldown_filter macro and ts_index_filter macro

It provides a set of views based on the asset, identity or file/process.  Rather than searching all data for the asset you are looking for, target your investigation on the asset(s) or identity of interest and then pivot to authentication events or network traffic events that are pertinent to the asset(s) or identity under investigation.
Dependencies
URL Toolbox https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2734/ is required for searches to populate a few of the panels within the DNS and Web tabs.
The Alexa (transitioning to the Cisco Umbrella 1M) list is also leveraged but if you are installing with Enterprise Security this will be available.
Enterprise Security is assumed to be installed due to workflow actions and certain drill-downs will take users to Enterprise Security dashboards.
Notes
SA-Investigator does not require population of Asset & Identity Framework to work.  However, if multiple values (IP Address, MAC, NT Hostname, Hostname) for assets are stored within ES, all values will be searched when using the asset investigator.
Release Notes 3.0.0
-Added text/checkbox filters to many tabular panels to filter search results including Endpoint, Authentication, DNS, Web and Certificates
-Added drilldowns to tabular endpoint panels that pivot to the identity investigator when user is clicked on, asset investigator when src or dest is clicked on, file/process investigator when process_exec, process_name or parent_process_exec is clicked on.
-Added parent process panel to file/process dashboard under endpoint with filters for dest and user as well as a pivot on the process_name for better search-ability of spawned processes.

Release Notes 2.2.0
-Added drill down from File/Process Artifacts to Hash Artifacts
-Added drill down from Asset Artifacts on Network Traffic IPs associated with host to better facilitate searches where no IP exists in Asset table
-Added additional filters on File/Process Artifacts view
Release Notes 2.1.2
-Added workflow actions to pivot to file/process and hashes from Incident Review
-Fixed File/Process Artifacts drill down - Endpoint - Application State Process Details
-Fixed Sysmon search in hashes to drill down on EventCode 1
-Fixed Network Traffic by App panel to strip out file paths to enable drill downs
Release Notes 2.1
-Added custom messages on each pane when no results are found so that it is immediately apparent that no data is found.

Release Notes 2.0
-The primary focus of this release was improving speed of search. This version has been tested against 100K assets and 60K user accounts for query performance. The biggest change is the elimination of the subsearches in the panels while retaining the ability to search asset and identity framework values like IP, DNS, NT Hostname and MAC in the case of assets and multiple identities.
-Added new panels and tabs for the Endpoint and Change datamodels (requires CIM 4.12)
-Commented out the Change Analysis and Application State datamodels as they are deprecated with 4.12 - Note that they can be re-enabled if desired.
-Modified identity search to autopopulate escape characters for usernames with a format of domain\username
-Modified the Windows Event Search tab to search specific fields for assets (host,dvc,src and dest) and identity (user) and added the ability to search multiple Windows Event Codes concurrently (comma separated)
-Modified the sourcetype search to search specific fields for assets (host,dvc,src and dest) and identity (user)

-All tablular results should sort oldest to newest
-Added note reminding everyone to use \ as an escape character for domain\user notation
-Fixed drilldowns for multi-asset searches
-Fixed search associated with DNS and Alexa-1M

Built for Splunk Enterprise 7.x.x or higher
CIM Compliant (CIM 4.x.x or higher)
Ready for Enterprise Security

Constraints / Requirements

Onboard data with sourcetype ""mobileiron:sentry"" so it can be properly transformed
Install this TA on your Search Head(s) & the first Splunk Enterprise instance that touches the data
Documentation for MobileIron Sentry syslog can be found here:
https://help.ivanti.com/mi/help/en_us/sntry/9.9.0/gdcl/Content/SentryGuide/Syslog.htm

INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
Installation Instructions

Install this TA on the first Splunk Enterprise instance that touches the data. This is typically a Heavy Forwarder or Indexer. This will put the proper index time settings in place required for this TA to function.
Install this TA on your Search Head(s)
Onboard your data with the sourcetype ""mobileiron:sentry""
Validate everything worked by searching for the two new sourcetypes in your environment: sourcetype=mobileiron:sentry:mi OR sourcetype=mobileiron:sentry:audit
If you see ""mobileiron:sentry"" as a sourcetype, then you did not install this TA on the first Splunk Enterprise instance that touches the data so the transforming is failing (or your data is formatted differently and you'd need to adjust the transforms.conf).

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5007,2022-01-09,08:41:12 AM,Windows WEC Add-On,,"Dec. 8, 2021","TA-windows-wec add-on for Splunk
This Add-on for Splunk ingests the output of the wecutil command-line utility. Namely,

Subscriptions list.
Subscription details and related event log statistics.
Subscription runtime status.

And registry pruning activities to remove inactive event sources. An event source is considered inactive when it has not sent an event or heartbeat for longer than a defined period.
The last three produce the following sourcetypes:

windows:wec:subscription:details
windows:wec:subscription:runtime
windows:wec:subscription:registry

Subscription details and related event log statistics
Subscription details are a combination of the output of the command:
wecutil gs SUBSCRIPTION_NAME
And some statistics from the EventLog where the events are stored. From both, the following fields are present in the details (sourcetype = windows:wec:subscription:details):

Subscription: Subscription Id.
Enabled: True whether the subscription is enabled.
ConfigurationMode: Custom, Normal, MinBandwidth, MinLatency.
DeliveryMode: push, pull
DeliveryMaxItems: Maximum number of items for batched delivery. Only valid for ""custom"" configuration mode.   
DeliveryMaxLatencyTime: Delivery max latency time (milliseconds)
HeartbeatInterval: Heartbeat interval (milliseconds)
AllowedSourceDomainComputers: SDDL ACL that contains the allowed computers to participate in the subscription
EventSource: list of computers (pairs: Address, Enabled) that can forward events to the event collector. This value is typically used for collector initated subscriptions. It can be used for source inititated subscriptions to disable the collection of events from a particular event source.
LogName: Log name where the events are saved.
EventPerSecond: Number of events per seconds (EPS).
TotalEvents: Total number of events.
NewestEventTime: Time stamp of the newest event in the log.
OldestEventTime: Time stamp of the oldest event in the log.
LogSize: Log size in Bytes.

Note: The list of event sources by default will not be included (see event source splitting).
Subscription runtime status
It parses the output from the command:
wecutil gr SUBSCRIPTION_NAME
The following fields are created (sourcetype = windows:wec:subscription:runtime):

Subscription : subscription name.
RunTimeStatus : runtime status.
LastError: last error value.
ErrorMessage: Error message (note: only in case of error)
ErrorTime: Timestamp of the error occurrence (note: only in case of error)
EventSource : list of event sources (note: see event source splitting). For collector initiated subscriptions, this list will be identical to the one in the subscription's configuration. For source initiated subscriptions, this list will be the set of event sources that collector has heard from in the last 30 days. Each event source contains the following fields: 
ComputerName : event source computer name.
RunTimeStatus : runtime status.
LastError: last error value.
LastHeartbeatTime : Time stamp with the last check-in.



Registry pruning
For each unique device that connects to a WEF subscription, there is a registry key (corresponding to the FQDN of the WEF Client) created to store bookmark and source heartbeat information.
The root registry key is:
HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\EventCollector\Subscriptions\
It parses the registry key for each subscription searching for inactive event sources and for those whose hearbeat is older than a defined retention period (in days) or null, they are removed. The following fields are created according to that operation (sourcetype = windows:wec:subscription:registry):

Subscription : subscription name.
Status : status of the pruning operation.
ErrorMessage: null or the error message produced by not being able to remove an event source.
ErrorTime:  null or timestamp of the error.
EventSource : list of event sources removed from the registry (note: see event source splitting). Each event source contains the following fields: 
ComputerName : event source computer name.
LastHeartbeatTime : Time stamp with the last check-in (in UTC).

Description




Search head
No
No
Splunk App TBD.


Indexer
Yes
No
This add-on should be installed on a heavy forwarder present on the WEC server. There is no need to install this add-on on an indexer too.


Universal forwarder
No
No
This add-on is not supported on a Universal Forwarder because it performs time formatting.


Heavy forwarder
Yes
Yes
Install this add-on on the heavy forwarder present on the WEC server.



That is, this add-on must be installed on the WEC server itself. It requires wecsvc running, wecutil command-line utility and PowerShell v5 or newer.
Configuration and troubleshooting
The TA-windows-wec brings only two configuration items that are present in the configuration file etc\default\ta-windows-wec_settings.conf.
Logging
    [logging]
    ; Log levels: DEBUG = Verbose, NONE = Default (Only warnings and errors)
    ; Errors and Warnings are also redirected to: splunk-powershell.ps1.log
    log_level=NONE   
The logs are generated to var/log/splunk/splunk_ta-windows-wec-details.log,  var/log/splunk/splunk_ta-windows-wec-runtime.log  and var/log/splunk/splunk_ta-windows-wec-prune-registry.log according to their sourcetype, and therefore parsed by Splunk.
index=_internal source=*ta-windows-wec*
Note: the log files are overwritten when they reach 150MB size.
Said all that, you should check splunk_ta-windows-wec-details.log, splunk_ta-windows-wec-runtime.log, splunk_ta-windows-wec-prune-registry.log and splunk-powershell.ps1.log.
Event source splitting
The list of event sources associated to a subscription can be enormous from just a few to thousands. This last makes the Splunk event very dense causing trouble to the browser to render the JSON array, think of arrays of thousands values for each event. But also, this can lead to easily reach the KV JSON event limit, and hence, truncate events. 
For those reasons two settings have been added:

rt_splitafter indicates the number of event sources after which the Splunk event of the subscription runtime status will be splitted. By default is set to 70, that is, after 70 event sources, the Splunk event is splitted. Zero or negative value will not split the event sources, but may cause undesirable side effects when inspecting the Splunk events as aboved mentioned.
sd_splitafter indicates the number of event sources after which the Splunk event will be splitted. By default is a negative value, that means no event sources are included in the Splunk event of the subscription details. A zero value will not split the event sources, but may cause undesirable side effects when inspecting the Splunk events as aboved mentioned.
pr_splitafter indicates the number of event sources after which the Splunk event of the subscription prune registry status will be splitted. By default is set to 70, that is, after 70 event sources, the Splunk event is splitted. Zero or negative value will not split the event sources, but may cause undesirable side effects when inspecting the Splunk events as aboved mentioned.

    [eventsource]
    ; - Zero or negative integer value will not split the event sources. Warning! in case of having thousands of
    ;   event sources the browser may have problems rendering the events, but also you may reach the KV JSON char limit.
    ; - Positive integer value will split the event source into batches. 
    rt_splitafter=70
    ; - Negative integer value it will not include the event sources for the subscription details.
    ; - Zero value will include and will not split the event sources. Warning! in case of having thousands of
    ;   event sources the browser may have problems rendering the events, but also you may reach the KV JSON char limit.  
    ; - Positive integer value will split the event sources into batches. 
    sd_splitafter=-1
    ; - Zero or negative integer value will not split the event sources for the subscription prune registry status.  
    ;   Warning! in case of having thousands of event sources the browser may have problems rendering the events, but 
    ;   also you may reach the KV JSON char limit.
    ; - Positive integer value will split the event source into batches. 
    pr_splitafter=70
Registry pruning
[pruning]
; Those event sources with a LastHeartbetTime older than this number of days from today will be removed from the
; registry or reported as candidate to remove, if report_only is true. 
days_old=60
; If true, it will only report for event sources whose LastHeartbeatTime is older than the maximum number of days
; from today instead of directly removing them from the regisry.
report_only=true

FAQ
Q: When I launch a container the first time, I cannot access Jupyter Lab.
A: The selected container image will be downloaded from dockerhub automatically in the background when you launch a container for the first time. Depending on your network this can take a while to download the docker image for the first time as the image sizes range from 2-12 GB. Please allow for some time to get the images initially pulled from Dockerhub. You can check which docker images are available locally by running docker images on your CLI.
Q: When I run DLTK 3.5 locally my browser showes insecure connection.
A: From DLTK 3.5 onwards the container images use HTTPS by default with self signed certificates for the data transfer related api endpoints and Jupyter Lab. Many browsers show ""insecure connection"" warnings and some allow to suppress that for localhost connections used during development. For production use, please work with your administrators to secure your setup and build containers with your own certificates as needed or use more advanced container environment setups.
Q: The example dashboards show no results or throw errors.
A: First, ensure that the right container image is downloaded and up and running for the specific example (e.g. TensorFlow examples require a TensorFlow container). Secondly, ensure that you have verified the associated notebook code exists in Juypter Lab and you have explicitly saved the notebook again (hit save button). By doing this, a python module is saved automatically generated (located in the /app/model folder in Juypter) which is needed to run the examples and populate the dashboards. Lastly, please check if MLTK's app permissions are set to global so that DLTK can use the lookup files used in most of the examples.
Q: Containers suddenly get stopped in about 1 minute after start.
A: Most likely you have two or more DLTK apps installed and configured to use the same container environment. In DLTK 3.x versions there is a scheduled search (MLTK Container Sync) that ensures synchronization of running containers and associated models for the DLTK app. If more than one DLTK app is running, this can cause synchronization collisions and therefore containers get stopped. When using DLTK 3.x please connect each DLTK app in a 1:1 relationship with your Docker and/or Kubernetes environment.
Q: Where are my notebooks stored in the docker environment?
A: By default, there are 2 docker volumes automatically mounted for persistance in your docker environment. Those volumes are named ""mltk-container-app"" and ""mltk-container-notebooks"". You can verify by running docker volume ls on your CLI. Important note: from DLTK version 3.1 onwards there is a new default volume called ""mltk-container-data"" - see migration notes below.
Q: What is the password for Jupyter Lab?
A: Please have a look at the Model Development Guide page in the Deep Learning Toolkit app.
Notebooks Migration note for change to 3.1 and later versions
Due to the addition of Kubernetes there was a change and addition made to the way how volumes behave. From 3.1 on and with the use of the golden image the container directory /srv is the default and notebooks and app code is in there. In earlier versions there were two docker volumes mounted into /srv/app and /srv/notebooks which will be mapped into a backup folder in Jupyter from version 3.1 on. For migration simply copy your notebooks from the backup folder back into the notebooks and app folder in case those are empty.",Version 3.7.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/6f2fbb64-3db6-11ec-9361-324b50038860.png,"Business Analytics, Utilities",https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-software-license-agreement.html,"3,928",0,splunk,5,5,Splunk Works,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/splunklabs,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

RECOMMENDED SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

Because this App runs on Splunk Enterprise, all of the Splunk Enterprise system requirements apply.

TOPOLOGY AND SETTING UP SPLUNK ENVIRONMENT

This app has been distributed in two parts.
JupiterOne Add-on for Splunk: It collects data from JupiterOne platform.
JupiterOne App for Splunk: It is used for visualizing JupiterOne data.


This app can be set up in two ways:
Standalone Mode:
Install the JupiterOne App for Splunk and JupiterOne Add-on for Splunk.
The JupiterOne App for Splunk uses the data collected by JupiterOne Add-on for Splunk and builds the dashboard on it.


Distributed Environment:
Install the JupiterOne App for Splunk and JupiterOne Add-on for Splunk on the search head. The user only needs to configure an account in JupiterOne Add-on for Splunk but should not create data input.
User needs to manually create an index on the indexer (No need to install JupiterOne App for Splunk or JupiterOne Add-on for Splunk on indexer).





INSTALLATION
Follow the below-listed steps to install an Add-on from the bundle:

Download the App package.
From the UI navigate to Apps-> Manage Apps.
In the top right corner select Install the app from file.
Select Choose File and select the App package.
Select Upload and follow the prompts.

OR

Directly from the Find More Apps section provided in Splunk Home Dashboard.

CONFIGURATION

The App does not require any specific configuration to make but in case of customized configuration of the JupiterOne Add-on for Splunk, the configuration of App has to be changed.

UPGRADE
From v1.1.0 to v1.2.0

No special steps are required to upgrade the JupiterOne App for Splunk from version 1.1.0 to version 1.2.0

From v1.0.0 to v1.1.0

No special steps are required to upgrade the JupiterOne App for Splunk from version 1.0.0 to version 1.1.0

Configure Macros:

If the user has selected a default index (Note: By default, Splunk considers only main index as default index) in ""Data Input"" configuration during JupiterOne Add-on for Splunk's configuration step, then no need to perform this step. But if the user has given any other index in ""Data Input"" configuration, then perform the following steps:


Go to ""Settings"" > ""Advanced search"" > ""Search macros"".
Select ""JupiterOne App for Splunk"" in ""App"" context dropdown.
Click on jupiterone_get_index macro from the shown table.
In the macro definition default value will be index=""main"". Update the definition with the index you used for data collection and save the configurations. For example: index=""<your_index_name>"".

DASHBOARD INFORMATION

J1 Alerts dashboard :
It has following panels:
Active Alerts : This panel gives single value count of alerts that are currently active.
Dismissed Alerts : This panel gives single value count of alerts that are dismissed. 
Active Alerts By Severity : This panel provides the bifurcation of alerts according to the severity.
Alerts Updated Over Time : This panel provides the count of active/dismissed alerts that were updated with relative to time period. 
Active Alert Details :  This panel provides the detailed information of the alerts that are currently active.





TROUBLESHOOTING

If dashboards are not getting populated:
Make sure if you are using the custom index, then check that jupiterone_get_index macro needs to be updated.
Make sure you have data in given time range.
To check whether is data collected or not, run ""jupiterone_get_index | stats count by sourcetype"" query in the search.
Try expanding TimeRange.



UNINSTALL APP

To uninstall app, user can follow below steps: SSH to the Splunk instance -> Go to folder apps($SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps) -> Remove the JupiterOneAppforSplunk folder from apps directory -> Restart Splunk
