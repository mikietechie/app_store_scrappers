For more information and details on the complete solution you can contact us.
Features
• Real-time Operational Intelligence for monitoring Release performance across multiple Build Programs
• Descriptive Analytics per Android Version, Phone Model and Releases
• Monitoring Dashboard Creation & Customization
• Error Trends Visualization
• Issue Drilldown & Android Level Analysis – Feature not supported in Trial Version
• MTBF Reporting for Release Performance Monitoring
• Error Categorization Sunburst
Use Cases
• Single Point Monitoring of Release performance across multiple Build Programs
• Itemized Analysis & Root cause based on all the collected records for any Error Reported
• User Customizable Release Monitoring & Release Comparison
Differentiators in the market


The primary USP of our solution is that:
a. It can analyse and visualize all the error data from all apps installed on the device
     AND
b. It can do this for all the devices that have our APK installed


Unlike the competitor tools which target Android App Developers/Companies, The target customers here are OEMs & Operators. It is not restricted to log collection for failures from 1 particular app or one particular user. 


Analytics on Collective Data from many devices (multiple Android Versions, Device Models, and releases) is potentially able to give a bigger insight, than accessing individual app's performance provided by competitor tools.


Big Data techniques of Data Mining and Searching are not applied to Android Log data till now by any open source or commercial tool at device level. 


Key Components
These are the Device and Server side components required for the Actual / Wi-Fi Router based deployment of this Solution:
• INTELLIPRETER - Splunk Enterprise SDK based Application
• Splunk Forwarder
• ACRA STORAGE - Log & Report Collection Server
• Crash Reporter - Android APK to be installed on Devices for tapping the Error Instance, Data Collection and Upload

The module expects geoinformation in the form of a ISO3166-2 country code or state code 
in the specified field in order to plot the results on the map. It's possible to define 
an optional countField which allows to process already aggregated results.
Example:
<module name=""HiddenSearch"" layoutPanel=""panel_row1_col1"" autoRun=""true"">
    <param name=""search"">sourcetype=access_combined clientip=* | geoip clientip</param>

The search used can produce any number of separate box plots on a single chart, within the the maximum limit of 10,000. It is unlikely someone can get 10,000 box plots on a single dashboard and obtain any value from the display, so this limit is likely sufficient.
The split by field (Service in the shipped example discussed below) must be the first field returned in the series. The rest of the fields may come in any order as long as the names match the required values: median, min, max, lowerquartile, upperquartile, iqr, lowerwhisker, upperwhisker.
For example, using the lookup shipped with the app, which looks like:
Service,Cost
Consulting,602
Sales,432
Manufacturing,1144
Marketing,814
The search looks like:
| inputlookup boxplotexample.csv | stats median(Cost) AS median, min(Cost) AS min, max(Cost) AS max, p25(Cost) AS lowerquartile, p75(Cost) AS upperquartile by Service | fields - count | where isnotnull(median)| eval iqr=upperquartile-lowerquartile | eval lowerwhisker=median-(1.5*iqr) | eval upperwhisker=median+(1.5*iqr)
The Box Plot Viz app does not, yet, handle outliers. However, in a future version using macros, outlier support will be added due to the complexity of searches involved causing using the app to be overly cumbersome for most users. It is already more than a standard viz requires from the user.
Thanks go out to:

Kevin Kuchta (http://kevinkuchta.com/) for extensive JavaScript assistance for rebuilding the original app to use pre-calculated inputs rather than raw data from a file.
Kyle Smith (https://www.aplura.com) for invaluable help both in understanding the complexities and sublteties of creating viz apps and assistance reworking the code to work correctly in the Splunk Custom Visualization framework.

SETUP AND INSTALLATION GUIDE 
VERSION 0.3.5
IMPORTANT
The Pulse API relies on precise time to generate cryptographic signatures. Please ensure your Splunk instance is in sync with Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers.
MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
SPLUNK ENTERPRISE
* The Pulse Technology Add-on will work with Splunk Enterprise 6.4 and later. If you are not on at least 6.4, you should consult the Splunk knowledgebase for instructions and guidance on upgrading your installation.
PULSE
 Contact support@pwnieexpress.com to get a copy of your API keys before you get started
 Ensure applicable services such as real-time wireless, blue-hydra and/or pwnscan are enabled and configured. Without these, the API will have no data to reference. For help on completing these tasks, please consult the Pulse User Guide 
INSTALLATION


Download the Pwnie Express Technology-Add on from the Splunkbase app store here: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3725


In Splunk, select Apps → Manage Apps, then “Install app from file”. 


Choose the file you downloaded in Step 1. 
   Note: You will need to restart Splunk to complete the installation process.


Select Configuration → Add-on Settings and input your valid PwnPulse API credentials;


Your API URL may vary depending on your region. The default is api.pwnieexpress.net. When complete, click ‘Save’. 
   Note: You may optionally adjust logging verbosity for troubleshooting/debugging purposes.


INPUTS
If you’ve successfully installed the Pulse Technology Add-On, the default inputs will be enabled.
HISTORICAL DATA FETCHING
By default the TA will download the past 7 days of historical data and index it into Splunk. The initial import can take time, but after that, only new changes are fetched.
  SOURCE TYPES
The add-on creates several new source types in Splunk. These provide easy-access to Pulse data in search and is helpful to distinguish which API endpoint was utilized. See Appendix 1 for a listing of available fields for each of these endpoints
Wireless Clients
    pulse:wireless_clients
    /v1/clients
Access Points
    pulse:wap
         /v1/access-points
Bluetooth
    pulse:bluetooth_devices
         /v1/bluetooth-devices
Network Hosts
    pulse:network_hosts
         /v1/network-hosts
Scripts
    pulse:scripts
         /v1/scripts
Task Schedules
    pulse:tasks
         /v1/task-schedules
Alerts
    pulse:alerts
         /v1/alerts
Threats
    pulse:threats
         /v1/threats
SEARCH AND DASHBOARDS


After your data is indexed in splunk, you should begin seeing the default dashboard populate.
The default dashboard is constructed with a few example searches, these are intended to help you construct meaningful displays relevant to your environment. 
The TA is configured to place API data in the default index. In our examples, that index is ‘main’. Your default index name may vary, you will have to adjust your searches accordingly.  
NETWORK HOSTS
Count the number of online/active network hosts across all sensors:
index=""main"" ""attributes.status""=online sourcetype=""pulse:network_hosts"" | stats count by attributes.mac | stats count
WIRELESS CLIENTS
Count the number of online/active wireless clients across all sensors:
index=""main"" ""attributes.status""=online sourcetype=""pulse:wireless_clients""  | dedup attributes.mac | stats count by attributes.mac| stats count
WIRELESS ACCESS POINTS
Count the number of online/active wireless access points across all sensors:
index=""main"" ""attributes.status""=online sourcetype=""pulse:wap""  | stats count by attributes.bssid | dedup attributes.bssid | stats count
BLUETOOTH DEVICES
Count the number of online/active bluetooth devices across all sensors:
index=main AND sourcetype=""pulse:bluetooth_devices"" AND attributes.status=online | dedup attributes.address | stats count
ALERTS
See the top 20 alerts across your pulse environments (defaults to last 24 hours):
index=""main"" sourcetype=""pulse:alerts"" | top limit=20 ""attributes.rule-name""
THREATS
See the top 20 threats across your pulse environments (defaults to last 24 hours):
index=main sourcetype=pulse:threats ""attributes.active""=true | top limit=20 ""attributes.description""
TROUBLESHOOTING
COMMON PITFALLS


Network Time Protocol (NTP) is out of sync.
        Solution: Run ntpdate or start the ntpd service on your Splunk server.


Invalid API URL 
        Solution: Check that your API URL is correct.


Invalid API credentials.
        Solution: Check that your API credentials are correct.


LOG LOCATIONS


/opt/splunk/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log
The default Splunk server log. May vary according to your implementation.      
Typically, any errors that may occur will be captured in this file.


/opt/splunk/var/log/splunk/ta_pulse_pwnpulse_api.log
This is the PwnPulse TA log. You can watch this file to monitor TA API calls in real-time.
        Tailing this file will be helpful in troubleshooting, should you encounter any issues.

Quickly see all calls matching any search filters.
Drilldown at any time to thoroughly investigate a particular call.
Click your way to pretty much any report over any combination of fields.

That third bullet sounds a little crazy - what about some examples?
You can:

create reports around concurrent calls and dropped calls.
create a chart of usage stats about your hunt groups.
see and share inbound/outbound call stats by agent or department.
create custom call quality reports and dashboards (MOS, jitter, latency, packet loss).
build utilization reports by device, device_type, sites, buildings, you name it.
drilldown at any time from any report, to inspect and sanity check the calls themselves.
but really, pretty much anything. Try it and see.

What are these, reports? dashboards? alerts?
Yes. For any of those use cases (and any you can dream up), you can:

create graphs, charts, tables, and even mapping visualizations of various kinds and package them into dashboards if you like.
set up alerting around anything - dropped calls, quality, volume thresholds.
share any and all of the above as dashboards with different teams and colleagues.
automate dashboards you created, to send pdf’s of themselves out every day/week.

What about my report that I don't see listed here?
Contact us and we'll help you learn how to create what you need for your own “somewhat unusual” CallManager deployment. There are over 200 fields (Check them out here). If you can in principle calculate the thing you need from some number of those fields, in some product or by hand, then we can show how to make the app do it.
Can I try it out?
Yes you can download the app from Splunkbase or from this site, and you can get a 90 day trial license string from this site. You can set the whole thing up yourself with your own live data, in about 30 minutes. See our installation and setup docs here.
Pricing
The app is priced by the size of your CallManager deployment - specifically the total number of User Licenses and Unassigned Device Licenses that are in use, in CallManager itself. At and below 400 such licenses in use, the cost is only $1,200 per year, but we have a range of customers at all scales from below 100 to above 50,000 licenses in use. Send us a screenshot of the total licenses in use from PLM, or a screenshot per cluster of the ""License Usage Report"" in CM Admin and we can let you know the exact cost.
Splunk Enterprise - do I need it?
Yes. The majority of our prospects are already Splunk Enterprise customers, and if this is you, this app will likely add only a negligible additional load to ingest the CallManager data that it needs. If you're not, Sideview is also a Splunk Reseller in North America so we can help you on that side.
How about Splunk Cloud?
Yes the app is vetted for Splunk Cloud. We do recommend that you contact us before proceeding though.
What versions of CUCM are supported?
CUCM 7.0 up to the current release 12.X
What are the actual data sources that it uses?

CUCM CDR - through Callmanager's own ""external billing server"" mechanism, CUCM will basically SFTP this data right to Splunk. See our install docs for full steps. 
CUCM CMR - these are the call quality records, and they come in via the same mechanism
CUBE CDR - This is an optional secondary data source.  see docs for more details
Syslog - Although the App's UI does not currently integrate anything from the syslog events yet, we do have documentation on how to pull them in.

However if the data you're hoping to work with isn't in that list, Feel free to contact us anyway!.",Version 6.2.2,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/85580642-7003-11ec-973b-e6c1b0396c73.png,IT Operations,https://sideviewapps.com/sideview-trial-internal-use-license-agreement/,"8,451",0,splunk,5,14,Sideview LLC,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/sideview_llc,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

USER GUIDE
Key concepts for ‘orgSecure’
Key to detect Threats is Active Monitoring and Machine Intelligence to detect anomal user behaviour. This can be achieved by creating a Baseline envelop which defines the expected usage of the user. This could be based on either historical data of user or the data of his colleagues of his department. It may be possible that a user may be excessively using Job portals if he is from HR but if envelop is configured correctly, it will not be detected as a abnormal behaviour since it is 'normal' for him.
In order to achieve this, orgSecure uses complex statistical techniques to create baseline envelops for users which determines their normal usage patterns. Any deviation from the envelops for consecutive periods are reported and should be investigated. Also, comprehensive dashboards and visualizations are provided to actively monitor user and asset activities.
Key Inputs to the application are:

Email
Web Activity
Login Logoff Logs
Device Access Logs
Removable Media Usage Logs

You can configure Alerts for any unusual Activities
Data types
This app provides the index-time and search-time knowledge for the following types of data:
Load Data
Below are the key SourceTypes:

orgsecure:http
orgsecure:email
orgsecure:device
orgsecure:logon
orgsecure:file

They are mapped as per CERT DARCA Data. Details found at:
URL : https://www.cert.org/insider-threat/tools/index.cfm
In case of any different data structure, you will have to modify the dashboard and report queries.
Lookup
Sample Lookups are provided under <lookup> folder. This needs to be updated with the details of your organisation. 
Lookups are:

LDAP: Employee Data of your employees
JobDomain: enter sites to monitor which are under Job portal category
SuspiciousDomain: enter sites to monitor which are suspicious and threat to organisation. Like Wikileaks, file sharing sites, etc
SuspiciousFiles: Enter software names which are to be monitored and which users should not access. E.g. keylogger
Psychometric: Enter psychometric test results of employees

Configure ‘orgSecure’
By default, ‘orgSecure’ does not come with any File Inputs. In order to add any Folders to monitor for input logs,

Go to Settings > Data Inputs
Click on Files and Directories
You can add Directories to monitor where you can place your financial documents. Save it with respective SourceType
You can also configure direct import of data as per Splunk best practices

In order to perform baseline analysis, select baseline envelop to be in history (say last 3 months) and select the period under analysis. The respective screens with show the abnormal behaviour as compared to the baseline envelops.
Example Use Case
Insider Threats is a major cause of concern for various organisations today. With a robust IT Infrastructure, organisations do fairly well to defend against any external intrusions. However, employees who have access to data from within the organisation remains a threat to confidential and critical data to business. 
With Advanced Analytics & monitoring, it is possible to detect any anomaly and take appropriate measures in time. orgSecure is an Splunk based Analytics Solution to detect Insider Threats and monitor User Activities. 
User behaviour, emails, Web Activity, File access and removable media access can be monitored through orgSecure and obtain details on threats and monitor user & asset activities",Version 1.0.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/image/default_icon.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,387,0,splunk,0,0,Khyati Majmudar,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/khyatininad,"Products: Splunk Enterprise

Deprecation Warning!!!
This app has been deprecated. There will be no new development or bug fixes. It has been replaced by the Aplura Intrusion App for Splunk.
Overview
Many organizations is IDS/IPS devices and software as their first line of defense against attackers. This app provides Splunk dashboards, forms, and reports which can be used to explore your IDS events across your different sourcetypes.
To do this, the app relies on the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) for IDS attack events. This means that the app can report on any authentication data, as long as it has been on-boarded properly, and is available through the Intrusion Detection data model, including network, host, wireless, and application products.
A note on Splunk Data Model Acceleration and Disk Space
This app requires data model acceleration, which will use additional disk space. If you are using the Splunk App for Enterprise Security, this is already enabled, and should have been factored into your retention policies. If not, you should review the documentation on data model acceleration, how it uses disk space, and how to plan for it.
A note on the Splunk Common Information Model
As mentioned above, the app uses the CIM for authentication events. The CIM allows you to take events from a number of sources or products, and report on them in one cohesive manner, using a common set of names for fields and event types.
Available Dashboards
Intrusion Overview
Provides a starting point for exploring your IDS events. Most panels will drill-down to other pages in the application.
Attack Source Profile
A view based on the source of IDS events.
Attack Destination Profile
IDS events where attacks are launched against the same destination.
Attack Signature Profile
Panels which focus on events which all are from the same identified with the same signature.
Attack Category Profile
A view focusing on attacks which fall into the same category (as defined in the events).
Attack Search
A form for finding events based on various field values.
Sourcetypes (Advanced)
Information about the sourcetypes which are present in the accelerated data.
Prerequisites
Splunk Versions
This app has been tested with Splunk versions 6.6. This app should be installed on the same search head on which the Authentication data model has been accelerated.
Splunk Common Information Model Add-on
This app depends on data models included in the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on, specifically the ""Authentication"" data model. Please review the information on installing and using the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on and information on configuring the acceleration on the data model.
The Splunk Common Information Model Add-on can be downloaded from Splunkbase.
This app has been tested with versions 4.9 of the CIM add-on. 
Data model Acceleration on the Intrusion data model
In order to make the app respond and load quickly, accelerated data models are used to provide summary data. For this data to be available, the Intrusion Detection data model must be accelerated. Information on how to enable acceleration for the Intrusion Detection data model can be found here. The data model must be accelerated for the length of time for which you would like to see reporting.
Installation
This app should be installed on a search head where the Intrusion Detection data model has been accelerated. More information on installing or upgrading Splunk apps can be found here.
Simple Installation Process

Make sure the field extractions and tags on your authentication events are correct.
Install the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on (skip if you are installing on an ES search head).
Install the Intrusion App for Splunk.
Enable accelerations on the Intrusion Detection data model (skip if you are installing on an ES search head).
Wait for the accelerations to start. After the acceleration searches have run, you should start seeing the dashboards populate.

About support for this app
Support for this app is provided on a best-effort basis. We have released this app for free, and want to help solve issues, and add features, but we also have day-jobs. The Github repo to report issues can be found here.

This app is impacted by a SPL xpath command bug (SPL-195545) found in 8.0.x.  As a workaround you can switch this app to use python.version = python 2 for the purpose of your testing.  Or to be more targeted you can add a command.conf into splunk_kom/local with the following stanza.

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/972,2022-01-08,10:15:54 PM,Security Onion App for Splunk software,,"Jan. 1, 2013","Security Onion:
Security Onion (http://securityonion.blogspot.com/) is a Linux distribution for intrusion detection and network security monitoring. Security Onion for Splunk is designed to run on a Security Onion server, providing an alternative method for correlating events and incorporating field extractions and reporting for Sguil, Bro IDS and OSSEC. (For a detailed description of the application with screenshots: http://eyeis.net/2012/04/splunking-the-onion/.)
Overview:
Splunk for Security Onion provides several dashboards and search interfaces for correlating Sguil, OSSEC and Bro IDS log events.
Required Splunk Apps:

Sideview Utils - http://splunk-base.splunk.com/apps/36405/sideview-utils 
Splunk for OSSEC - Splunk v4 version -http://splunk-base.splunk.com/apps/22285/splunk-for-ossec-splunk-v4-version 
Geo Location Lookup Script (powered by MAXMIND) - http://splunk-base.splunk.com/apps/22282/geo-location-lookup-script-powered-by-maxmind 
Google Maps - http://splunk-base.splunk.com/apps/22365/google-maps 
Splunk Visualizations - http://splunk-base.splunk.com/apps/22283/splunk-visualizations

Prerequisites:
A Security Onion server and a Splunk 5.x installation. (Note: when installing Splunk on a Security Onion system there will likely be a port conflict for the Splunk web server. Port 81 as an alternate port should be a safe alternative.)
Setup Splunk:
Download from www.splunk.com. Install via terminal command:
sudo dpkg -i splunk-5.*.deb
When install completes, we need to start Splunk for the first time:
cd /opt/splunk/bin
sudo ./splunk start
After accepting the agreement, you'll have to pick an alternate port for the Splunk web interface since the default is in use. You'll see the following and when prompted to change, choose yes, then specify port 81:
Checking prerequisites...  
Checking http port [8000](http://splunkbase.splunk.com/wiki/8000): already bound  
ERROR: The http port [8000](http://splunkbase.splunk.com/wiki/8000) is already bound. Splunk needs to use this port.  
Would you like to change ports? [y/n](http://splunkbase.splunk.com/wiki/y:n): y  
Enter a new http port: 81  
Setting http to port: 81  
Checking http port [81](http://splunkbase.splunk.com/wiki/81): open  
Checking mgmt port [8089](http://splunkbase.splunk.com/wiki/8089): open  
Checking configuration... Done.

Splunk's built-in way to run at boot time is (as root): $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk enable boot-start with an optional user=foo at the end to run as a certain user. It installs proper boot scripts for your OS so you don't need to worry about editing /etc/rc.* files:
/opt/splunk/bin/splunk enable boot-start
Install Required Splunkbase Apps:
Open Firefox and browse to http://localhost:81 (or if you used an alternate port change accordingly). Change your password, then click App > Find More Apps from the menu in the upper right corner. Find the following apps and install them.  

Install Splunk for OSSEC - Splunk v4 version
Install Geo Location Lookup Script (powered by MAXMIND)
Install Google MapsInstall Splunk Visualizations
Install Sideview Utils
Install Security Onion for Splunk

Configure Bro IDS Inputs:
Depending on how much traffic your sensor monitors, you may need to leave some of the Bro inputs disabled to avoid maxing out your license. The following are the sourcetypes configured for each Bro IDS log data input:

bro_communication - Bro sensor communications  
bro_conn - Connections  
bro_dns - DNS requests  
bro_dpd - Dynamic Protocol Detection  
bro_ftp - FTP activity  
bro_http - HTTP traffic  
bro_irc - IRC activity  
bro_known_certs - Certificates seen  
bro_known_hosts - Hosts seen  
bro_known_services - Services detected  
bro_notice - You definitely want this one enabled  
bro_smtp - SMTP activity  
bro_smtp_entities - SMTP  
bro_software - Software versions detected (incl. vulnerable versions)  
bro_ssh - SSH activity  
bro_ssl - SSL activity  
bro_syslog - Syslog activity  
bro_weird - Anomalous events

Using Splunk for Security Onion:
I've standardized the source and destination IP fields in the Bro IDS and Sguil log field extractions so ""src_ip"" and ""dest_ip"" are consistent across events.
Log file data inputs are file specific (as opposed to monitoring the entire /nsm/bro/logs/current/ directory) primarily for granular control over what gets splunked. Depending on your licensing you may need to scale back certain logs and this provides an easy way to do so.
SOstat Monitoring:
The SOstat monitoring scripts are configured to run at various intervals (in seconds). The default settings are very conservative, 
executing most scripts once a day and status scripts 3 times a day. The default configuration is:
Sourcetype - Script - Interval (seconds)  

sostat_disk - /opt/splunk/etc/apps/securityonion/bin/disk.sh - 86400  
sostat_ifconfig - /opt/splunk/etc/apps/securityonion/bin/ifconfig.sh - 86400  
sostat_nsm_log_archive - /opt/splunk/etc/apps/securityonion/bin/nsm_log_archive.sh - 86400  
sostat_nsm_sensor_ps-status - /opt/splunk/etc/apps/securityonion/bin/nsm_sensor_ps-status.sh - 21600  
sostat_nsm_server_ps-status - /opt/splunk/etc/apps/securityonion/bin/nsm_server_ps-status.sh - 21600  
sostat_nsm_sguil_uncategorized - /opt/splunk/etc/apps/securityonion/bin/nsm_sguil_uncategorized.sh - 86400  
sostat_top - /opt/splunk/etc/apps/securityonion/bin/top.sh - 21600

The default settings can be modified via Splunk Manager > Data Inputs > Scripts. Click on the script name in the ""Command"" column to increase/decrease the interval. You can also disable/enable scripts.

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3623,2022-01-08,10:16:02 PM,TA-sendcef,,"June 20, 2017","TA-sendcef
TA-sendcef provides a custom Splunk search command, sendcef, for creating and sending CEF-formatted events over TCP or UDP. The underlying command uses the Splunk Custom Search Command protocol, version 2.
The specification for CEF, Common Event Format, is available in PDF from McAfee.
Supported Splunk Versions
The sendcef custom command will only work with 6.4.x or higher versions of Splunk. Version 2 of the Splunk Custom Search Command protocol was introduced as a technology preview with Splunk 6.4.
System Requirements
The sendcef command is a binary application written in Go. The TA has binaries included for the following platforms:
 * Darwin (OS X) 64-bit
 * Linux 64-bit
 * Windows 64-bit
Installation
Use normal Splunk installation procedures to install the TA. This includes installation through the Splunk UI or ""unzipping"" and copying to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps. The application is a Splunk .spl file, which can be renamed to .tgz and decompressed.
Released versions are available on GitHub: TA-sendcef
Configuration
Configuration of sendcef is made through a custom conf file, specifically sendcef.conf. This file must be available in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-sendcef/local. The local directory will need to be created after installing the application.
In the local directory, create the sendcef.conf file.
Here is an example configuration file:
[general]
#logLevel = debug
#timeout = 5s

[ceftarget:tcp]
server = your_server_ip:10522
protocol = tcp

[ceftarget:udp]
server = your_server_ip:10523
protocol = udp
General Stanza
The [general] stanza above is not required but it does include some commented configurations that can be used to modify the behavior of sendcef.
Valid values for logLevel include debug, info, warn, and error. The default is warn. Most log messages are either debug or error.
The default timeout is 10s (ten seconds). Valid, but not necessarily good, values are available from the Go time.ParseDuration function documentation.
""Target"" Stanzas
The ""target"" stanzas can be named anything. The examples append :tcp and :udp but a stanza could just as easily be [foobar].
Within a target stanza, it's pretty basic. Name the stanza what you want. Then add a server value which includes a hostname or IP address followed by a port number (separated by a colon). For protocol, choose either tcp or udp.
Usage
sendcef is a custom Splunk search command, so it's usually appended to a Splunk search. Here's a full example of a search command using sendcef:
index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd ERROR 
| convert timeformat=""%m-%d-%Y %H:%M:%S.%3N"" ctime(_time) AS cef_time 
| eval cef_host = host, 
    cef_device_vendor = ""Vendor"", 
    cef_device_product = ""Product"", 
    cef_device_version = ""Version"", 
    cef_event_class = ""Class"", 
    cef_name = ""Name"", 
    cef_severity = ""10"", 
    cef_extension = ""message, source"" 
| sendcef ceftarget:tcp
The base search, index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd ERROR, is simple and should work on nearly any Splunk system. If the search returns either zero records or many thousands, you may want to refine it to a managable number for your initial testing.
The next portion of the search sets up all of the CEF record format fields:
| convert timeformat=""%m-%d-%Y %H:%M:%S.%3N"" ctime(_time) AS cef_time 
| eval cef_host = host, 
    cef_device_vendor = ""Vendor"", 
    cef_device_product = ""Product"", 
    cef_device_version = ""Version"", 
    cef_event_class = ""Class"", 
    cef_name = ""Name"", 
    cef_severity = ""10"", 
    cef_extension = ""message, source"" 
These should become self-explanatory once we look at a sample output record.
The final portion of the search, | sendcef ceftarget:tcp, is what calls the sendcef custom search command. A configured stanza name is the sole command argument.
Here is an example record that would get sent to the target host and port over either TCP or UDP:
06-05-2017 10:09:26.392 Tims-MBP CEF:0|Vendor|Product|Version|Class|Name|10|message=File too small to check seekcrc, probably truncated.  Will re-read entire file\='/Users/tim/opt/splunk-sendtest/var/log/splunk/django_error.log'. source=/Users/tim/opt/splunk-sendtest/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log
In the search command, notice how full control of the event formatting is handled by using convert and eval to set key fields prior to calling sendcef. The full power of the Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL) is available to set these fields.
sendcef uses these fields when processing:
 * cef_time 
 * cef_host
 * cef_device_product
 * cef_device_vendor
 * cef_event_class
 * cef_name
 * cef_severity
 * cef_extension
This example hard-codes the CEF header fields but these values could just as easily be dynamic and based on the underlying Splunk event (using any SPL commands.)
The cef_extension field is handled differently. cef_extension takes a comma-separated list of fields from the underlying Splunk event and formats these name/value pairs (with escapes where necessary) before appending them to the end of the CEF message. Notice in the example output message above how message and source are handled as CEF extension fields.
Note: Don't rely on the order of these extension fields. sendcef randomizes the order of these extension fields in the output.
sendcef can be used as an ad hoc search command but it will often be used to automate data integration with third-party servers using Splunk saved/scheduled searches.
Note: The output of a command using sendcef will return the unformatted, original events to the browser as search results. A future version of sendcef may return the formatted CEF messages to the browser. Also, this custom command only asks Splunk for the cef_* fields and any fields within cef_extension. This could mean that additional extracted fields are not available in the search results.
Testing
To faciliate testing using a local Splunk instance, a related TA has been developed. TA-sendtest provides test target indexes, TCP and UDP Splunk inputs, and a sendcef.conf.sample similar to what was used in this documentation.
Further information on this application is available on GitHub: TA-sendtest
Troubleshooting
sendcef logs events at: $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/sendcef.log
These events can be searched with Splunk using: index=_internal source=*sendcef.log
Related Application
A similar application has been developed for sending ""raw"" Splunk events to third-party servers.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
1. Please try installing the App on your own instead of requesting it to be installed for a better experience.  Simply Browse for more Apps, search for chargeback and then click on Install next to the Chargeback App for Splunk Cloud.  You can refer to this guide: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/latest/Admin/SelfServiceAppInstall#Install_an_app
2. Please add a new column to the chargeback_app_2_bunit_csv.csv lookup table and call it perc_ownership
3. Please watch this video to learn how to configure the app on your own: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LFRlkfEJFlCzyXiIUvjPSmL7uT0_T1ma
Please install the following Apps on the same Cloud Search Head or Search Head Cluster you are intending to install and use the Chargeback App for Splunk Cloud:
1. Lookup File Editor
2. Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit
Please note that you must install the Python for Scientific Computing Add-on before installing the Machine Learning Toolkit. Please download and install the appropriate version here:
- Mac: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2881/

Configuration
You can watch this video if that helps: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LFRlkfEJFlCzyXiIUvjPSmL7uT0_T1ma
Once the App is installed and when opening it up for the first time the followin popup message appears: Click on the link to complete the app setup procedure if you haven't done that already.  This will take you to the App Setup and Configuration Dashboard from the dashboard click on the App Setup Screen.
Enable the following Jobs by selecting Enable:
I. Click to enable all Chargeback Jobs required for this App:

chargeback_app_splunk_cloud_summary_tracker ""Chargeback App for Splunk Cloud Tracker Job Summary Index (Hourly)""
chargeback_cloud_stack_info_csv_lookup_gen ""Splunk Cloud Search Heads CSV Lookup Gen Job (Daily)""
chargeback_identities_custom_kv_store_lookup_gen ""Custom Identities Enrichments CSV Lookup Gen Job (Daily)""
chargeback_summary_identities_kv_store_lookup_gen ""Chargeback Identities KV Store Gen Job From Summary Index (Daily)""

II. Configure Chargeback Summary Job Weights and Summary Index:

Adjust the chargeback_summary_index and enter in the Definition box an index name you would like to use to store the summary data generated by the above jobs .  It's recommended to use an index called chargeback_summary with a retention of at least 13 months but ideally 2 years.  Make sure this index was created before saving.

After you are done enabling the Jobs above and configuring an index to use, click on the Save button at the bottom of the screen to complete the setup and then close the Setup Screen tab in your browser,
Perform the following steps for the first time to get the necessary Chargeback Identity enrichments working:
Step 1
Run the Splunk Cloud Stack Search Head Info Job  for the first time and make sure the job produced data.  The job creates the chargeback_cloud_stack_info_csv_lookup Lookup Table used in later jobs to populate the label field to accurately store user information in later steps.
Step 2
From the App Navigation Menu select App Configuration and then Select App Setup.
Under section 3 Chargeback App for Splunk Cloud Jobs click on the Chargeback Custom Identities Gen Job (Edit and customize this Job) to open the job for editing.
Configure the Job to collect the following information about users in your organization that are using Splunk Cloud today or potentially may use it in the future:
    1. user_name
    2. name
    3. type
    4. title
    5. email
    6. biz_unit
    7. biz_dep
Step 3
Click on the Chargeback Identities - Summary Index - Gen Job - From REST to collect all the users defined on the Search Head you are running this job on.
This job must be configured on every Search Head in your stack including your Input Data Manager (IDM).
Step 4
Login to every Standalone Search Head and Search Head Cluster in your stack and create the following Job:
Job Name: chargeback_rest_identities_summary_data_gen
Job Schedule: Edit the Job and Schedule it with the following Cron Expression: 18 3 * * * 
Job Search:
| rest /servicesNS/-/-/authentication/users splunk_server=local timeout=0
| rename title As user_name , realname As name roles As splunk_role_map type As auth_type
| eval Splunk_Instance = lower(splunk_server), user_name = lower(trim(user_name)), email = lower(email)
| stats Last(name) As name , Last(email) As email , Values(splunk_role_map) As splunk_role_map , Values(auth_type) As auth_type By Splunk_Instance, user_name
| eval _time = now() | foreach splunk_role_map, auth_type [ eval <<FIELD>>=mvjoin(mvsort(mvdedup('<<FIELD>>')), ""|"") ]
| table _time, Splunk_Instance, user_name, name, email, splunk_role_map, auth_type
| collect index=chargeback_summary source=splunk_rest_identities_summary_data sourcetype=stash testmode=false | stats count

Finish by running the Job for the first time on the Search Head or Search Head Cluster you configured it on.
Step 5
Go back to the App Setup Dashboard and click on the Chargeback Identities - KV Store - Gen Job - From Summary Index Job to create the chargeback_rest_identities_kv_store_lookup KV Store Lookup for the first time.
Step 6
Click on the Chargeback Tracker Job link and make sure the job produces data and runs without any errors.

App Terminology

Splunk Cloud Virtual Core (SVC) is a unit of capabilities that includes these resources in Splunk Cloud: compute, memory, and I/O.
Dynamic Data: Active Searchable(DDAS) is used for searching ingested data. DDAS is also commonly known as searchable storage or Local Storage including Splunk Cloud SmartStore.  For further information see: Dynamic Data: Data Retention Options in Splunk Cloud
Dynamic Data: Active Archive(DDAA) is Splunk Cloud Index Archiving in AWS S3 Glacier.  Its an optional Splunk Cloud subscription.  DDAA offers a lower cost option for long term storage of your ingested data.  DDAA Can be restored to DDAS to be searched.
Dynamic Data: Self-Storage(DDSS) is your own Index Archiving Self Storage AWS S3 Bucket.  It allows you to export your aged data from Splunk Cloud Platform. If you enable DDSS to export your aged ingested data, the oldest data is moved to your Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage account in the same region as your Splunk Cloud Platform deployment before it is deleted from the index.
-- Please Note the following about DDSS:  You are responsible for payments for your use of Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage. Aged data is exported unencrypted to your Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage account.  For further information see:
Dynamic Data: Self-Storage - Compliance, Cloud and Data Lifecycle and Splunk Cloud Platform Service Description
