This app is not officially supported by Splunk Support. If you have a current Splunk Enterprise Support entitlement, Splunk will provide best-effort support for cases involving this app directly, but such cases will not be subject to the Splunk Enterprise Support SLA.
Description
The Splunk for Citrix NetScaler app is a set of field extractions, reports, lookups and dashboards which provide visibility into the Citrix NetScaler AppFlow, Application Firewall and VPN data. This app is configured to work with version 9.x of the Citrix NetScaler.
The Splunk App for NetScaler with AppFlow translates binary AppFlow data to time- stamped ASCII text, so Splunk can utilize it and put it in context of all other data in the environment such as custom application log data, logs and metrics data of application components such as web servers, application servers, databases, firewalls, hypervisors and more. With added visibility into NetScaler and Appflow data, systems administrators and application support professionals are able to get central visibility into their entire environment and are able to correctly identify performance bottlenecks that lead to user experience issues. In addition to being able to detect and troubleshoot application performance issues faster, administrators can also visualize baselines, trends and other analytics that can help them plan capacity and make transactions more efficient for a better customer experience. 
Splunk’s powerful visualization provides real-time views and role-appropriate dashboards on the state of key application performance and availability metrics. The flexibility and universality of Splunk allows you to put your operational data in a business context to allow richer, more informed business decision making. It also allows you to integrate in non-IT data to provide value added analysis that support the organization’s business objectives.
Splunk App for NetScaler with AppFlow— Dashboards and Reports
The Splunk App for NetScaler with AppFlow contains over 30 reports for situational awareness and dashboards supporting key business and security performance indicators (KPIs). Key reports available include:
HTTP user agent: shows you which platforms are most commonly used to access your web application
Most requested URLs: allows you to prioritize your response time optimization
Source and destination IPs and ports: gives you real time insight into the origins of your traffic
Average transaction times and round trip response times: allows you to monitor end user service levels 
Traffic analysis by applications/servers: includes analysis of latencies and bandwidth usage 
Load balancing dashboard: provides views of total bytes transferred by source destination and protocol
Web application firewall dashboard: shows violations by type over time, violations by IP address and the URL of the web page attacked. 
SSL-VPN dashboard Critical Statistics dashboard: indicates the number of HTTP transactions URI, virtual server, user and host trended over time. 
System Audit dashboard: depicts system console events and tracking commands/changes by user.
Reports from Splunk can be downloaded in PDF or Excel format and data ranges are fully supported. Reports can also be scheduled for delivery to individuals as PDFs. The Splunk App for Citrix NetScaler supports core Splunk functionality such as the ability to drill-down into raw log data from graphical elements and robust role-based access control. 
Getting Started
For this app to work your Citrix NetScaler data must be extracting fields correctly. The Field Extractions included in this app are configured for the NetScaler v 9.0 and higher.

SailPoint's IdentityNow AuditEvent Add-on has been certified by Splunk and is designed to provide customers the ability to extract audit information from one or more of their IdentityNow tenants using Splunk Enterprise or Splunk Cloud. Along with the audit information, the.SailPoint Adaptive Response Add-on also provides a source types with in.Splunk®.This source type is used to collect events from SailPoint's IdentitNow tenant(s). Users can configure this source type to collect events to Splunk®.and populate a custom dashboard visualizing different types and details for these events.
Using IdentityNow's AuditEvents API, we can solve a number of problems with this add-on. Some examples include:

Surface and gain insights into the brute force password attempts IdentityNow has blocked
Correlate IdentityNow user activity with other system events to identify coordinated attacks
Evaluate the timing of login attempts from different geographies to identify problems

Requirements
Full functionality requires the following:

In order to stream AuditEvent data to a Splunk Enterprise, or Splunk Cloud deployment, an active IdentityNow tenant must exist.
Configuration requires that the implementer also have the organization name of their IdentityNow API gateway.
Splunk® Enterprise Security (7.3.0+)

Quick Start
Create an instance of the modular input through the GUI or by editing the inputs.conf file contained within.
Input parameters

Client ID (client_id): Your Project Nova client ID
Client Secret (client_secret): Your Project Nova client secret
Search (search): Search to run against Project Nova (* retrieves all results within a timeframe)
Checkpoint (checkpoint): Optional ""earliest_time"" for Project Nova search. Leave blank to get all historical events on the first run, or use Splunk timespecs like ""2/20/2018:16:30:00"", ""-mon"", or ""@d"" to limit history. This parameter is automatically updated by the input as it collects new events from Nova.
Entity = Host (entity_is_host): Enable this to populate each event's host field from its Project Nova entity field. Otherwise, uses the standard Splunk host parameter (under ""More Options"" in the GUI) to populate.

| array2object field=_raw path=""<path>"" key=""<relative path>"" value=""<relative path>""
Paths are expressed in dot notation, including when entering arrays. For example, event[0].key needs to be written as event.0.key.
field
Optional, defaults to _raw
Splunk field containing the JSON data to parse.
path
Mandatory
The path from the root of the JSON object to the array. Must point to an array, and must be written in dot notation eg event.AuditKeyValues.
key
Mandatory
The relative path from the array, to the value which will be used as the key for each array item. Ideally the value of this field would be unique but the command will create multivalue fields if there is overlap.
value
Optional, defaults to all children except the key
The relative path from the array, to the value(s) of the new field. Typically used to set the output to a single value like ""ValueString"", but accepts a relative path, and all children from the path will be added.
Example
CrowdStrike's EventStream data contains an array of objects called AuditKeyValues, where each member contains a object with the keys ""Key"" and ""ValueString"". From the root of the JSON object, this arrays path would be ""event.AuditKeyValues"" in dot notation.
""event"":{
  ""AuditKeyValues"":[
    {""Key"":""actor_cid"",""ValueString"":""abcdef1234567890""},
    {""Key"":""target_user"",""ValueString"":""brett.whynot@gmail.com""}
  ]
}
Using the array2object command will create new fields using the value of the key for each of the arrays objects:
| array2object path=""event.AuditKeyValues"" key=""Key""
event.AuditKeyValues.actor_cid.ValueString = ""abcdef1234567890""
event.AuditKeyValues.target_user.ValueString = ""brett.whynot@gmail.com""
When there is only a single value expected (key value pairs), you can specify the value path to get shorter field names:
| array2object path=""event.AuditKeyValues"" key=""Key"" value=""ValueString""
event.AuditKeyValues.actor_cid = ""abcdef1234567890""

Heatwave is vastly superior to the standard visualizations graphing derived measures avg/min/max/std, because Heatwave will show the actual spread and distribution of those measures (like a histogram) over time.
A canonical use case is to measure performance metrics such as throughput, or latency values. By using Heatwave, you can often see ""clusters"" that show up as ""bands"" over time, usually indicating underlying attribute influencing the metrics. From what you see in Heatwave, you can then drill down or filter in order to find the root cause of performance issues evidenced by the data.

Installation steps
NOTE: Where referenced, the IA-cb_psc_for_splunk and TA-cb_psc_for_splunk versions of this App are located on Splunkbase.
Deploy to single server instance
Follow these steps to install the app in a single server instance of Splunk Enterprise:

Deploy as you would any App, and restart Splunk.
Configure.

Deploy to Splunk Cloud

Have your Splunk Cloud Support handle this installation. Do NOT install the IA on the same system as the App.
You may consider using an on-premise Heavy Forwarder to install IA-cb_psc_for_splunk, and send the logs to Splunk Cloud.

Deploy to a Distributed Environment

For each Search Head in the environment, deploy a configured copy of the App. DO NOT SEND TA or IA to a Search Head Cluster (SHC).
For each indexer in the environment, deploy a copy of the TA-cb_psc_for_splunk Add-On that is located as mentioned above.
For a single Data Collection Node OR Heavy Forwarder (a full instance of Splunk is required), install IA-cb_psc_for_splunk and configure through the GUI.

User Guide
Key concepts for CB ThreatHunter For Splunk

Make sure the event type is configured properly for the App on the Application Configuration page. This will determine if the data is visible in the App.

Modular Input
NOTE: You will need to configure a new modular input for each tenant

Navigate to the Application Configuration dashboard to configure the modular input.
Click the Create New CB ThreatHunter Input.
Fill out the form.
Modular Input Name: Name for the data input configuration.
Hostname: The hostname of CarbonBlack tenant you have been assigned.
Token: The API key retrieved from the CarbonBlack interface.
Connector ID: The connector that is used with the API key to pull the notification data.
Interval: The number of seconds indicate how often the input will poll for new data. This setting must be at least 120.
Index: This sets the index for data to be written to. This setting should be changed from default, which normally writes to the main index, to a specified index for best performance.
Proxy Name: Enter the name of the proxy stanza to use with the input.



NOTE: When configuring the modular input through the Application Configuration dashboard, the password is automatically encrypted into the credential store. If you need to change the credential, create a new credential, and reference the realm/connector id pair in the modular input configuration. An encrypted credential is required for this Splunk App.
Indexes
By default all events will be written to the main index. You should change the index in the modular input setup to specify a custom location.
Configure Proxy Support
This App Supports proxy configuration. Configure the proxy first in the Application Configuration dashboard on the Proxy Tab, and then choose it during the modular input configuration.

NetTrust is a real-time Preemptive Breach Detection System (BDS). A correlation and analytics engine maps system dialog-based network behavior events to discrete stages in the life cycle of advanced threats, and generates infection profiles at application runtime, which are automatically mapped to patterns of post-infection, pre-breach behavior. The NetTrust callback and obfuscation detection engine provides unique capabilities to assess signaling integrity and data exchange between systems for command and control beacons (dial-homes), attack preparation and data exfiltration. Automated analytics joins the dots, amplifies the signal and reduces false positives to provide on-demand evidence for immediate pre-breach containment and response.",Version 1.1,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/49920856-24c9-11e5-9742-0aed84b7c0b3.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://taasera.com/legal/commercial-license,194,0,splunk,0,0,parth r,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/parthr,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

The MS Windows AD Objects application leverages admon(ActiveDirectory) data for building and updating AD object
lookup files stored in the kvstore. These lookup files can then be leveraged for looking up the latest (< 10 Minutes) AD attribute information of User, Groups, Group Policies, Organizational Units, and Computer AD objects. This app also contains updated dashboard files for the Splunk'ae for Windows Infrastructure and Splunk'ae for Microsoft Exchange applications that you can optionally use instead of the default ones proved by these applications. These updated files replace the use of the SA_LDAPSearch (Splunk'ae Support Add-On for Active Directory) ldap queries in the searches/macros/dashboards to instead use the MS Windows AD Objects lookups.

Use Cases
Dynamic AD Object LookupNeed to capture, dynamically build and update Active Directory Object lookup tables for Users, Groups, Computers, OUs, and Group Policies.Security or IT OperationsAudit or manage Active Directory Object creations, deletions, moves, modifications and advance events to performance correlation analytics.Audit or manage AD User Logins, either for potential Security threats or IT Service impact.Correlation of AD Objects and other data sourcesCorrelate Active Directory Objects with Windows Events or any other Splunk indexed datasources.

IMPORTANT - XMLWinEventLog - msad_action field extraction - Work Around
There is a current issue where the msad_action field is not being extracted by the Splunk AddOn for Windows for XMLWinEventLogs. This field is heavily leveraged by this application, so below is a workaround until the TA is fixed, or a new version of this app is released.
First: Add an automatic lookup for source XMLWinEventLog:Security using the AD_Audit_Change_EventCodes lookup.
In the MS Windows AD Objects app, navigate to Settings - - > Lookups - - > Automatic Lookups.Click New Automatic LookupEnter the following:Name: ms_ad_obj_wrkaround_msad_actionSource: XmlWinEventLog:SecurityLookup Input Fields:EventCode = EventCodeobj_type = obj_typeLookup output Fields:change_action = change_actionClick SaveSet the permissions to the app and role permissions
Second: Update the source::XmlWinEventLog:Security : EVAL-msad_action calculated field in the MS Windows AD Objects app.
In the MS Windows AD Objects app, navigate to Settings - - > Fields - - > Calculated FieldsIn the Search box, type msad_actionClick on the source::XmlWinEventLog:Security : EVAL-msad_actionReplace the Eval Expression:From: if(msad_action=“change” OR msad_action=“changed” OR msad_action=“set” OR msad_action=“reset”,“modified”,if(msad_action=“add”,“added”,if(EventID=“4722"",“enabled”,msad_action)))To: if(isnull(change_action),if(msad_action=“change” OR msad_action=“changed” OR msad_action=“set” OR msad_action=“reset”,“modified”,if(msad_action=“add”,“added”,if(EventID=“4722”,“enabled”,msad_action))),change_action)Click Save

New in Version 4.1.1
Split AD_Obj_(User/Group/Computer) Lookups into separate lookups by domainThis updated version will help large environments shrink their AD_Obj_User, AD_Obj_Group and AD_Object_Computer lookups, by providing a way to split out each of them into separate, smaller, lookups for each AD Domain.This prevents running into KV Store replication limits, by providing smaller KV Stores required to replication.Note: The AD Objects - CFG - Split KVs dashboard located in Configuration Dashboards - Advance Configurations will walk you through how to enable and set this up is Windows Registry ReportsThis updated version also provides 9 new Windows Registry Reports.

This Add-on for Splunk ingests the output of the wecutil command-line utility. Namely,

Subscriptions list.
Subscription details and related event log statistics.
Subscription runtime status.

And registry pruning activities to remove inactive event sources. An event source is considered inactive when it has not sent an event or heartbeat for longer than a defined period.
The last three produce the following sourcetypes:

windows:wec:subscription:details
windows:wec:subscription:runtime
windows:wec:subscription:registry

Subscription details and related event log statistics
Subscription details are a combination of the output of the command:
wecutil gs SUBSCRIPTION_NAME
And some statistics from the EventLog where the events are stored. From both, the following fields are present in the details (sourcetype = windows:wec:subscription:details):

Subscription: Subscription Id.
Enabled: True whether the subscription is enabled.
ConfigurationMode: Custom, Normal, MinBandwidth, MinLatency.
DeliveryMode: push, pull
DeliveryMaxItems: Maximum number of items for batched delivery. Only valid for ""custom"" configuration mode.   
DeliveryMaxLatencyTime: Delivery max latency time (milliseconds)
HeartbeatInterval: Heartbeat interval (milliseconds)
AllowedSourceDomainComputers: SDDL ACL that contains the allowed computers to participate in the subscription
EventSource: list of computers (pairs: Address, Enabled) that can forward events to the event collector. This value is typically used for collector initated subscriptions. It can be used for source inititated subscriptions to disable the collection of events from a particular event source.
LogName: Log name where the events are saved.
EventPerSecond: Number of events per seconds (EPS).
TotalEvents: Total number of events.
NewestEventTime: Time stamp of the newest event in the log.
OldestEventTime: Time stamp of the oldest event in the log.
LogSize: Log size in Bytes.

Note: The list of event sources by default will not be included (see event source splitting).
Subscription runtime status
It parses the output from the command:
wecutil gr SUBSCRIPTION_NAME
The following fields are created (sourcetype = windows:wec:subscription:runtime):

Subscription : subscription name.
RunTimeStatus : runtime status.
LastError: last error value.
ErrorMessage: Error message (note: only in case of error)
ErrorTime: Timestamp of the error occurrence (note: only in case of error)
EventSource : list of event sources (note: see event source splitting). For collector initiated subscriptions, this list will be identical to the one in the subscription's configuration. For source initiated subscriptions, this list will be the set of event sources that collector has heard from in the last 30 days. Each event source contains the following fields: 
ComputerName : event source computer name.
RunTimeStatus : runtime status.
LastError: last error value.
LastHeartbeatTime : Time stamp with the last check-in.



Registry pruning
For each unique device that connects to a WEF subscription, there is a registry key (corresponding to the FQDN of the WEF Client) created to store bookmark and source heartbeat information.
The root registry key is:
HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\EventCollector\Subscriptions\
It parses the registry key for each subscription searching for inactive event sources and for those whose hearbeat is older than a defined retention period (in days) or null, they are removed. The following fields are created according to that operation (sourcetype = windows:wec:subscription:registry):

Subscription : subscription name.
Status : status of the pruning operation.
ErrorMessage: null or the error message produced by not being able to remove an event source.
ErrorTime:  null or timestamp of the error.
EventSource : list of event sources removed from the registry (note: see event source splitting). Each event source contains the following fields: 
ComputerName : event source computer name.
LastHeartbeatTime : Time stamp with the last check-in (in UTC).

This add-on should be installed on a heavy forwarder present on the WEC server. There is no need to install this add-on on an indexer too.


Universal forwarder
No
No
This add-on is not supported on a Universal Forwarder because it performs time formatting.


Heavy forwarder
Yes
Yes
Install this add-on on the heavy forwarder present on the WEC server.



That is, this add-on must be installed on the WEC server itself. It requires wecsvc running, wecutil command-line utility and PowerShell v5 or newer.
Configuration and troubleshooting
The TA-windows-wec brings only two configuration items that are present in the configuration file etc\default\ta-windows-wec_settings.conf.
Logging
    [logging]
    ; Log levels: DEBUG = Verbose, NONE = Default (Only warnings and errors)
    ; Errors and Warnings are also redirected to: splunk-powershell.ps1.log
    log_level=NONE   
The logs are generated to var/log/splunk/splunk_ta-windows-wec-details.log,  var/log/splunk/splunk_ta-windows-wec-runtime.log  and var/log/splunk/splunk_ta-windows-wec-prune-registry.log according to their sourcetype, and therefore parsed by Splunk.
index=_internal source=*ta-windows-wec*
Note: the log files are overwritten when they reach 150MB size.
Said all that, you should check splunk_ta-windows-wec-details.log, splunk_ta-windows-wec-runtime.log, splunk_ta-windows-wec-prune-registry.log and splunk-powershell.ps1.log.
Event source splitting
The list of event sources associated to a subscription can be enormous from just a few to thousands. This last makes the Splunk event very dense causing trouble to the browser to render the JSON array, think of arrays of thousands values for each event. But also, this can lead to easily reach the KV JSON event limit, and hence, truncate events. 
For those reasons two settings have been added:

rt_splitafter indicates the number of event sources after which the Splunk event of the subscription runtime status will be splitted. By default is set to 70, that is, after 70 event sources, the Splunk event is splitted. Zero or negative value will not split the event sources, but may cause undesirable side effects when inspecting the Splunk events as aboved mentioned.
sd_splitafter indicates the number of event sources after which the Splunk event will be splitted. By default is a negative value, that means no event sources are included in the Splunk event of the subscription details. A zero value will not split the event sources, but may cause undesirable side effects when inspecting the Splunk events as aboved mentioned.
pr_splitafter indicates the number of event sources after which the Splunk event of the subscription prune registry status will be splitted. By default is set to 70, that is, after 70 event sources, the Splunk event is splitted. Zero or negative value will not split the event sources, but may cause undesirable side effects when inspecting the Splunk events as aboved mentioned.

    [eventsource]
    ; - Zero or negative integer value will not split the event sources. Warning! in case of having thousands of
    ;   event sources the browser may have problems rendering the events, but also you may reach the KV JSON char limit.
    ; - Positive integer value will split the event source into batches. 
    rt_splitafter=70
    ; - Negative integer value it will not include the event sources for the subscription details.
    ; - Zero value will include and will not split the event sources. Warning! in case of having thousands of
    ;   event sources the browser may have problems rendering the events, but also you may reach the KV JSON char limit.  
    ; - Positive integer value will split the event sources into batches. 
    sd_splitafter=-1
    ; - Zero or negative integer value will not split the event sources for the subscription prune registry status.  
    ;   Warning! in case of having thousands of event sources the browser may have problems rendering the events, but 
    ;   also you may reach the KV JSON char limit.
    ; - Positive integer value will split the event source into batches. 
    pr_splitafter=70
Registry pruning
[pruning]
; Those event sources with a LastHeartbetTime older than this number of days from today will be removed from the
; registry or reported as candidate to remove, if report_only is true. 
days_old=60
; If true, it will only report for event sources whose LastHeartbeatTime is older than the maximum number of days
; from today instead of directly removing them from the regisry.
report_only=true

USER GUIDE
Key concepts for ‘orgSecure’
Key to detect Threats is Active Monitoring and Machine Intelligence to detect anomal user behaviour. This can be achieved by creating a Baseline envelop which defines the expected usage of the user. This could be based on either historical data of user or the data of his colleagues of his department. It may be possible that a user may be excessively using Job portals if he is from HR but if envelop is configured correctly, it will not be detected as a abnormal behaviour since it is 'normal' for him.
In order to achieve this, orgSecure uses complex statistical techniques to create baseline envelops for users which determines their normal usage patterns. Any deviation from the envelops for consecutive periods are reported and should be investigated. Also, comprehensive dashboards and visualizations are provided to actively monitor user and asset activities.
Key Inputs to the application are:

Email
Web Activity
Login Logoff Logs
Device Access Logs
Removable Media Usage Logs

You can configure Alerts for any unusual Activities
Data types
This app provides the index-time and search-time knowledge for the following types of data:
Load Data
Below are the key SourceTypes:

orgsecure:http
orgsecure:email
orgsecure:device
orgsecure:logon
orgsecure:file

They are mapped as per CERT DARCA Data. Details found at:
URL : https://www.cert.org/insider-threat/tools/index.cfm
In case of any different data structure, you will have to modify the dashboard and report queries.
Lookup
Sample Lookups are provided under <lookup> folder. This needs to be updated with the details of your organisation. 
Lookups are:

LDAP: Employee Data of your employees
JobDomain: enter sites to monitor which are under Job portal category
SuspiciousDomain: enter sites to monitor which are suspicious and threat to organisation. Like Wikileaks, file sharing sites, etc
SuspiciousFiles: Enter software names which are to be monitored and which users should not access. E.g. keylogger
Psychometric: Enter psychometric test results of employees

Configure ‘orgSecure’
By default, ‘orgSecure’ does not come with any File Inputs. In order to add any Folders to monitor for input logs,

Go to Settings > Data Inputs
Click on Files and Directories
You can add Directories to monitor where you can place your financial documents. Save it with respective SourceType
You can also configure direct import of data as per Splunk best practices

In order to perform baseline analysis, select baseline envelop to be in history (say last 3 months) and select the period under analysis. The respective screens with show the abnormal behaviour as compared to the baseline envelops.
Example Use Case
Insider Threats is a major cause of concern for various organisations today. With a robust IT Infrastructure, organisations do fairly well to defend against any external intrusions. However, employees who have access to data from within the organisation remains a threat to confidential and critical data to business. 
With Advanced Analytics & monitoring, it is possible to detect any anomaly and take appropriate measures in time. orgSecure is an Splunk based Analytics Solution to detect Insider Threats and monitor User Activities. 
User behaviour, emails, Web Activity, File access and removable media access can be monitored through orgSecure and obtain details on threats and monitor user & asset activities",Version 1.0.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/image/default_icon.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,387,0,splunk,0,0,Khyati Majmudar,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/khyatininad,"Products: Splunk Enterprise

NOTE: Security Token
When you access Salesforce from an IP address that isn’t trusted for your company, and you use a desktop client or the API, you need a security token to log in.
What’s a security token? It’s a case-sensitive alphanumeric code that’s tied to your password. Whenever your password is reset, your security token is also reset.
password : \<password> + <security_token>
Another alternative to avoid using the security token, is to relax IP restrictions.

    <param name=""search"">index=_internal | stats count AS values by group series | sort - values | stats list(series) AS categories list(values) AS data BY group | rename group AS name</param>
    <param name=""earliest"">-7d</param>
    <module name=""DonutChart"">
      <param name=""palette"">#4572A7,#AA4643,#89A54E,#80699B,#3D96AE,#DB843D,#92A8CD,#A47D7C,#B5CA92</param>
    </module>
  </module>

NOTE: The default palette contains 9 colors. If your search yields more than 9 events -- which would create more than 9 inner-slices of pie -- you will need to provide a palette with more color selections, or risk your donut chart showing only shades of gray.
Three fields must be present or calculated in your data to produce donut charts:
name - this represents the label for an inner-ring pie slice.
categories - this contains the label for each outer-ring sub-division of a pie slice; it can be a multi-valued field or a comma-separated list.
data - this contains the values for each outer-sing sub-division. It can be a multi-valued field or a comma-separated list, and it needs to be sorted to map each value's position to the respective position in the cateories field. The add-on will calculate percentages based on these values.
Here is a sample search that will produce the desired output:
index=_internal | stats count AS values by group series | sort - values | stats list(series) AS categories list(values) AS data BY group | eval categories=mvindex(categories, 0, 10) | eval data=mvindex(data, 0, 10) | rename group AS name

The output will look as follows:

Status information - Collection Metrics

Status information - Sessions over time

New App:
This app pulls all sessions from the NetWitness device, if you are looking for an app that only pulls certain sessions based on a query criteria, please look at the app ****
Windows Users:

Please make sure you change the LAST_SID_FILE path or application will fail.


ISSUE: SSL not working out of the box

Summary: Python's default urllib2 and SSL libraries used by the app are hard-coded to only negotiate SSLv23 with servers, however in order to be FIPS compliant the NW services only accept TLS connections.
Full Details/Discussion: 

Changes worthy of note:
For all other changes see the CHANGELOG

Added info to all events All events will now contain the following field rest_host=[rest_host]
[rest_host] is extracted from TOP_URL_LEVEL from :// to :
Works best in conjunction with the multiple config file feature as it will identify the device where the meta is collected


Allow user to specify 'nwsdk' configuration file name as an argument to allow for multiple instances of data collection
It allows users to specify multiple inputs on inputs.conf while selecting a different configuration file, it can be used to connect to concentrators directly on larger environments where brokers aren't available or can't be used
If none is specified 'nwsdk.conf' will be used by default, otherwise specify only the name and omit extension, the file should be a .conf file under ../local/ 
Not fully documented on README yet, please e-mail me if you think you need to use it and I will assist.


Using summary indexing for Dashboards
Created Saved Searches to Support summary index based dashboards

Major changes include:

BUG FIX: Made the trailing ""/"" on the rest_host extraction optional, app would crash if the trailing ""/"" was missing (User reported issue)
BUG FIX: Added ""&expiry=0"" to all queries to fix possible HTTP timeouts (User reported issue)
BUG FIX: Changes in NetWitness 9.8 (and other late releases) break the script. MAC Addresses are no longer returned as integers and are now returned as strings, the script was expecting an int and not doing proper error checking. It should now handle both cases.
You can check if you are affected with the following search index=_* nwsdk.py sourcetype=""splunkd"" ""int()""


BUG FIX: Check last session id processed on each batch to make sure is as expected if not force correction (can cause some data loss)
BUG FIX: Changed TRUNCATE to 0 in props.conf as some lines are greater than 10000 and were being broken incorrectly
BUG FIX: Converted all meta field names to lower case to avoid problems with timestamp parsing
BUG FIX: Processing stats were calculated wrong for the initial run (when LAST_SID_FILE is missing)
Added code to read in custom/additional mappings from nwsdk.conf under [mappings] section (based on customer feedback)
BUG FIX: When reading ""NO_SID_FILE_OPTION"" from nwsdk.conf it wasn't being properly converted to an integer
BUG FIX: SMTP view wasn't parsing attachment names correctly when these contained spaces

Installation
Unzip this folder in your Splunk installation $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps and restart Splunk. On your R server install OpenCPU (https://www.opencpu.org/download.html). In Splunk go to the setup page of the R app and fill out the address of your OpenCPU installation.
Installing packages
OpenCPU will create a new session (and user) for every request it gets. These sessions will be removed after some time. Packages installed in such a session are not available to other sessions and will be removed once the session is removed. Installing packages globally can be done by installing them to the /usr/local/lib/R/site-library directory or by running the following from the command line:
sudo R
install.packages(<package_name>, lib = ""/usr/local/lib/R/site-library"")

The full documentation of OpenCPU can be found here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/opencpu/vignettes/opencpu-server.pdf (Chapter 3.2 deals with installing packages)
Examples
Search in Splunk, send the data to R and retrieve the full dataset:
search index=_internal | head 10 | runRdo script=""return(dataset);""

Using R libraries in Splunk and returning links to images (or the console) instead of results:
| inputlookup iris.csv 
| fields - species 
| runRdo script=""library(corrplot); correlationMatrix = cor(dataset); corrplot(correlationMatrix);"" getResults=f

Datatypes and column order (thanks to jedatt01 on Splunk Answers for the example: https://answers.splunk.com/answers/455710/potential-bug-in-r-analytics-app.html)
| inputlookup iris.csv 
| runRdo script=""
    # Fix the random seed
    set.seed(1);

    # Store the dataset in a variable
    my_iris = dataset;

    # Seperate the species column from the rest
    species = as.factor(my_iris$species);
    my_iris = my_iris[ , !(names(my_iris) %in% c('species'))];

    # Cast data types
    my_iris$petal_length = as.numeric(my_iris$petal_length);

Splunk and DTEX Systems have partnered to accelerate zero-trust security operations with insider risk intelligence and endpoint telemetry ignored by NGAV, UEBA and DLP tools.
DTEX InTERCEPT™ brings a previously unavailable data source to SOC, IR and threat intelligence teams while multiplying the value of Splunk ES and SOAR.  It’s lightweight, cloud-native, privacy-by-design architecture scales to thousands of endpoints and servers in hours, collects only 3-5 MB of data per user each day with low CPU usage and zero impact on employee efficiency.
Only DTEX InTERCEPT delivers the context and intelligence that answers the Who, What, When, Where and How related to any potential insider threat situation, compromised account event or data loss scenario without invading personal privacy.  
Insider threats, data loss events and account compromise follow a pattern of activity. DTEX analysts have identified and codified the insider equivalent: the Insider Threat Kill Chain, which encompasses the five steps present in nearly all insider attacks to provide organization-wide user visibility that highlights every step of the kill chain, rather than just focusing on the moment of exfiltration.

The goal of the Splunk Usage Reporting App is to provide Splunk customers which are using licenses from the pricing program you have signed up for (EAA, True-Up, etc.) a compliance reporting tool.  This app is a facility to report license indexing volume for each Splunk environment in a customer's deployment.  Per the requirements of the adoption agreement, indexing statistics must be provided to the Splunk Account Team on an annual basis.
This guide accompanies the Splunk Usage Reporting App installation file.  There are a few installation steps required and some instructions on how to use the app for compliance.
Usage Reporting Dashboard
After the app is installed and Splunk is restarted, when launching the app in Splunk, the Usage Reporting Dashboard is displayed.  It will display analytics for a one year period from the beginning of the installation of the app.  

Installation - Begin the Install
This app must be installed on every ""License Master"" or independently licensed installation of Splunk.  If you have 10 splunk servers and one of them is the License Master, install it on that server.  At the Splunk Home screen, click the ""gear icon"" next to the word ""Apps"" to begin the simple installation process.  Your account team will assist you in the process if necessary.  They will provide a Splunk app file named ""splunk_usage_reporting.spl""

Installation - Installing the App from a File
After clicking the gear icon on the home screen, you are taken to the Apps manager in Splunk.  Click ""Install App from File""

Installation - Select the installation file
After you have clicked ""Install app from file"", Splunk will present a file chooser box (native to your operating system).  Locate and select the file ""splunk_usage_reporting.spl"".

Installation - Uploading the app
After selecting the file for installation, click ""Upload"".  Splunk will upload the file from your local web browser to to the destination Splunk server chosen for install.  Remember, please install this on every License Master or independent Splunk Server or environment.

Installation - Restart Splunk
After the app is uploaded, Splunk will prompt for a restart.  Complete the restart as soon as possible.

What's Inside - Scheduled Search to Collect Data
The Splunk Usage Reporting App aggregates data collected from the license_usage.log, stored in the ""_internal index"".  The aggregation copies events from the _internal index to an index called ""summary"". Since the _internal index only retains data for 30 days, this method will allow you to keep your indexing statistics for a considerably longer time--allowing you to meet your compliance requirements.
To do this, a scheduled search runs nightly at 1:00 a.m in your local time zone.  A tiny amount of data is extracted--sometimes just a few lines per day.  This search should have no noticeable impact on your Splunk environment.   Below is a screenshot of this particular search.  Note:  This search comes enabled at installation time and must remain so for this app to provide reporting and visualization.  An example of the search is provided in the next screenshot.

What's Inside - Summary Indexing
This is the bottom section of the ""scheduled search"" it shows the index in which the daily license entries are added to.  Please avoid changing settings as the dashboards and searches rely upon it.   If you do not have an index called ""summary"", please create one.

What's Inside - The actual nightly entries
These entries are collected every night with the scheduled summary indexing search.  They are copied directly from the _internal index.  These events contain the daily indexing volumes (in bytes) for each environment.  The fields contain slave ID, pool, pool size, stack and stack size.  The fields are used to build the tables and visualizations on the Usage Reporting Dashboard

What's Inside - An Accelerated Data Model
This data model is included.  It extracts information from the Summary index and stores data in the efficient Splunk High Performance Analytics Store.   It can be used to store analytics for a long period of time and is availble to use if needed.  There may be updates to the app that use this data model

Usage - Annual Export
On an annual basis, reporting to the Splunk Account Team is required.   Please take the following steps for every Splunk environement this app is installed on:
Export the ""Daily Indexing Statistics"" table by clicking on the ""Export"" button on the lower left of the panel below

Usage - Exporting Indexing Statistics
After pressing the ""Export"" icon on the panel above, ensure the format is ""CSV"".  Choose a file name to save the file--you might make it descriptive of the year and environment.  Set the results to be ""unlimited"".  This will download the file in your browser and will be saved in the location your browser is configured to.

Usage - Downloading Your Indexing Statistics
Your browser--while it may look different than this example--should have a list of files you have downloaded.  The CSV export of the Indexing Statistics should be attached to an email to your Splunk Account Team along with a Screenshot or PDF printout of the ""Usage Reporting Dashboard"" dashboard from the Splunk Usage Reporting App

Usage - Providing an Image of the Usage Reporting Dashboard
There are many ways to render the Usage Reporting Dashboard dashboard.  One could take a screenshot, save it to a file and then attach it to an email.  Many modern web browsers and operating systems allow for a ""Print/Save/Export to PDF"" function.  Below is an example of Chrome on Mac OS X.  Print the page or save as a PDF as a part of compliance proof.

Usage - Final steps for Splunk Usage Reporting
On annual basis, please complete the PDF printout and statistics export steps or every licensed splunk environment, be it a License Master or an independent server(s).  Provide the PDF's and CSV's to your assigned Splunk Account Team

This add-on polls the OTX API and indexes pulses, and their related indicators, into Splunk.
You can then use these indicators and pulses you see fit, however if you are a Splunk for Enterprise Security user you should also get the partner app SA-otx, which uses this data and adds threat indicators into the Splunk ES threat collections.
To use this add-on:

Sign-up to OTX: https://otx.alienvault.com -- You will automatically be subscribed to public threats published by AlienVault, but you can also sign up to other useful groups and users. It's recommended that you subscribe to the groups and users you wish to follow now, so that the initial backfill gets all your subscribed pulses.
Retrieve your API key at: https://otx.alienvault.com/api
Create the Splunk index ""otx""
Navigate to the ""Addon for OTX"" app in Splunk
Create an input for OTX pulses and indicators using your OTX key and the new index you created

Soon after this point you should soon be able to see OTX data by searching:

Configure Syslog Streaming on Barracuda NG Firewalls
Configure and enable syslog streaming for every Barracuda NG Firewall you want to include in the Splunk App.
Step 1.1. Enable Syslog Streaming
Open the Syslog Streaming page (Config > Full Config > Box > Infrastructure Services).
Click Lock.
Set Enable the Syslog service to yes.
splunk_syslog01.png
Click Send Changes and Activate.
Step 1.2. Configure Logdata Filters
Define profiles specifying the log file types to be transferred / streamed.
Open the Syslog Streaming page (Config > Full Config > Box > Infrastructure Services).
In the left menu, select Logdata Filters .
Click Lock.
Click the + icon to add a new filter. 
Enter a Name and click OK. The Filters window opens.
Click + in the Data Selection table and select Firewall_Audit_Log.
Fatal_log and Panic_log data can also be streamed to the Splunk server, but are currently not processed by the Barracuda NG Firewall Splunk app.
Select Selection from the Affected Box Logdata dropdown and click +. The Data Selection window opens.
Enter a Name and click OK.
In the Log Groups table, click + and select Firewall-Activity-Only from the list. 
splunk_syslog01a.png
Click OK.
Select All from the Data Selector dropdown menu.
Click OK.
splunk_syslog02.png
Click Send Changes and Activate.
Step 1.3.  Configure the Logstream Destinations
Configure the data transfer settings for the Splunk server. You can optionally choose to send all syslog data via an SSL-encrypted connection.
Open the Syslog Streaming page (Config > Full Config > Box > Infrastructure Services).
In the left menu, click Logstream Destinations.
Click Lock.  
Click + in the Destinations table. The Destinations window opens.
Configure the Splunk server logstream destination: 
Remote Loghost – Select explicit-IP .
Loghost IP Address – Enter the IP address of the Splunk server. 
Loghost Port – Enter 5140 for plaintext or 5141 for SSL-encrypted connections.
The Barracuda NG Firewall app can only process syslog data that is received on port 5140 (not encrypted) or 5141 for SSL-encrypted connections.
Transmission Mode – Select TCP or UDP (only for unencrypted connections).
Sender IP – Enter the management IP address of the Barracuda NG Firewall. 
(optional) Use SSL Encapsulation – Select yes to send the syslog stream over an SSL-encrypted connection.
(optional) Peer SSL Certificate – Import the SSL certificate configured on the Splunk server for this data import. 
Configure the Splunk server to receive SSL-encrypted connections. For more information, see http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Inputsconf.
Override Node Name – Select no. 
Click OK. 
splunk_syslog03.png
Click Send Changes and Activate.
Step 1.4. Configure Logdata Streams
Create a logdata stream configuration combining the previously configured Log Destinations and Log Filters.
Open the Syslog Streaming page (Config > Full Config > Box > Infrastructure Services).
In the left menu, click Logstream Stream . 
Click Lock.
Click + in the Streams table.
Enter a Name and click OK. The Streams window opens. 
In the Log Destinations table, click + and select the  Log Destination created in Step 1.3. 
In the Log Filters table, click + and select the Log Filter created in Step 1.2.
 splunk_syslog04.png
Click OK.
Click Send Changes and Activate.
All firewall log data is now being streamed to the Splunk server.
Step 2. Data Data Input on Splunk
The Splunk server must be configured to receive the syslog data. Verify that you have a Data input entry for TCP or UDP port 5140 or TCP port 5141 (SSL) that listens for the incoming syslog streaming connections. You must use port 5140/5141 because the Barracuda NG Firewall Splunk app can only process data received on these ports. For more information, see http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/6.2.0/Data/Monitornetworkports.
Step 3. (optional) Enable SSL Encryption for Barracuda NG Firewall Splunk App
If you want to SSL encrypt connections with Splunk, you must modify the inputs.conf configuration file for the Barracuda NG Firewall Splunk App.
Copy your SSL certificates to /opt/splunk-6.2/etc/auth/server.pem and /opt/splunk-6.2/etc/auth/box-cert.pem.
Login to the Splunk server via SSH.
Edit $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/BarracudaNGFirewall/default/inputs.conf and add a section for SSL:
[SSL]
serverCert = /opt/splunk-6.2/etc/auth/server.pem
password = password
requireClientCert = true
rootCA = /opt/splunk-6.2/etc/box-cert.pem
Restart Splunk. 
Certificate Troubleshooting
If you see log messages containing the string ""alert bad certificate"" in the bsyslog log file, the rootCA certificate is either missing or invalid. Set requireClientCert to false to disable the certificate check.
2014 12 16 09:43:34 Notice   +01:00 Syslog connection established; fd='14', server='AF_INET(127.0.0.1:6224)', local='AF_INET(0.0.0.0:0)' 2014 12 16 09:43:34 Error    +01:00 [18697:4146318224] SSL_connect:14094412: error:14094412:SSL outines:SSL3_READ_BYTES:sslv3 alert bad certificate
Step 4. Enable Application Logging in the Firewall
Application data is collected on a per-access rule basis. Set the Application Log Policy to Log All Applications in the Advanced Firewall Rule Settings for each access rule that matches traffic you want to include in the data collected on the Splunk server. For more information, see Advanced Firewall Rule Settings.",Version 1.0.10,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/419f6f4a-34e4-11eb-82a4-02fa7700cf1c.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,"1,483",0,splunk,3,5,Barracuda Networks,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/barracudanetworks,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2719,2022-01-10,07:50:04 AM,Add-on for Socket.IO,,"May 14, 2015","Add-on for Socket.IO
Overview
This add-on provides provides a Socket.IO Modular Input which hosts a Socket.IO server that can receive large volumes of events realtime which will be fed into Splunk.

Adding the input

From Splunk Home, click the Settings menu. Under Data, click Data inputs, and find Socket.IO, the input you just added. Click Add new on that row.
Fill in:
name (whatever name you want to give this input)
port (the port socket.io should listen on). If the port is taken an error will be returned.
(optional) origins (the origins to restrict for CORS, * by default)


Save your input, and navigate back to Splunk Home. You should now have a Socket.IO server listening on the specified port waiting for events.

Sending events to Splunk
Splunk will listen for a specific message called 'event'. It should contain a single parameter which is a string value.
Testing out the input

In the app folder you will find a test.html. Open the file and modify the url in the io constructor to point to your host and port.
Open test.html in your browser.
Check your browser dev tools to see if you get any errors. If not the event was succesfully sent.
In Splunk, issue a search for sourcetype=socket.io. You should see an event with {""message"": ""Hello from Socket.IO""}.

How it works
This input spins up a socket.io server on the specified port. Whenever messages are received of type 'event', then it extracts the message and creates an Event which is then written back to Splunk.
Configuring Socket.IO: Transports, Auth etc.
All code for configuring Socket.IO exists in the app/socketioInput.js file in the streamEvents function. You can easily modify the code to enable Auth or plug in your own middleware.

It contains a snapshot of the latest data from Johns Hopkins University's CSSE group's Covid19 page.  ( https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data ).   As such no setup is required after install - after installation you will be able to fully use the entire app. NOTE - You will first need to install the ""Canary"" app and the ""Sideview Utils"" app, also available on Splunkbase. They won’t run any scheduled searches or use any resources or cause any trouble.  Nor will installing any of these apps earn you any email from us or from anyone else.  This app's focus is allowing anyone to keep up to date of the development of the Covid19 pandemic. Specifically it allows you to track and compare statistics split by countries, provinces and states.   You choose which countries, states and provinces you are interested in, and which statistics you want to chart.    In a nutshell it will give you a way to short circuit many Covid19 discussions by saying ""you know I think we can just go look at this stuff and see for ourselves.""2 requests1) the selfish one -- please consider sending me an email to say hi.  It was a fairly large amount of work to create this app, and even tiny anecdotes of people using it does make my day. 2) IF YOU INSTALL THIS APP,  PLEASE DO TRY TO UPDATE IT REGULARLY.  It does not fetch new data automatically,  instead you must update it to get new data.   However, having said that,  if you do feel somewhat comfortable running a python script from the shell, there are two ways to update the data without updating the entire app version. 1) On a smaller or more standalone instance (or on a wild-west non-SHC but distsearch instance),  you can log into the SH host, cd to etc/apps/covid19_sideview/bin   and run  splunk cmd python refresh.py and that script will reach out to the internet refresh the three datasources. (I'm pretending splunk is in PATH although this might not be true on your host)2) You can set up a dev instance of the app on your laptop,  do #1 above, and then the end result of that is that you get new slightly larger copies of three csv files in etc/apps/covid19_sideview/lookups.   Deploy those lookups to your production instance and the end result is the same.",Version 1.3.17,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/5135a90c-d552-11ea-ba46-02fa7700cf1c.png,Business Analytics,https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT,"7,250",0,splunk,5,10,Nick Mealy,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/sideview,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

Features


Easy Incident Mapping: Enables mapping of static values or search result tokens into Resilient incident fields. You can map fields parsed from the event in the alert or notable event directly into any incident field. You also have custom incident mapping rules for each saved alert or notable event.


Create Artifacts: Maps result tokens into artifacts at the same time the incident mapping is defined. 


Custom Field Discovery: Retrieves the incident definition from the Resilient platform so that all defined fields and field values are catalogued inside Splunk or Splunk ES. This allows you to add custom fields to the Resilient platform, which are then available for mapping in Splunk or Splunk ES.

Automatic and Manual Escalation: Escalates notable events from a correlation search or alerts from a saved search to Resilient incidents (automatic escalation). For Splunk ES only, you can escalate notable events as an ad hoc action (manual escalation). 

System Requirements

Splunk version 8.0 or later for Python 3 support.
Splunk ES 6.1.0 or later (only if working with Notable Events) for Python 3 support.
Splunk CIM Framework. Note: The Add-On depends on Splunk CIM. Please install CIM before installing the Add-On.
Resilient platform version 35 or later.
Ability to connect directly from Splunk to your Resilient platform with HTTPS on port 443.
A dedicated Resilient Administrator or equivalent account on the Resilient platform. This can be any account that has the permission to create incidents and simulations, and view and modify administrator and customization settings. You need to know the account username and password.
NOTE: Connecting to Resilient with API keys is not supported. You must use an account username and password.
NOTE: Should you later change the dedicated Resilient account to another user, the new user must also have the permission to edit incidents, in addition to the permission to create incidents and simulations and view and modify administrator and customization settings. The edit permission is necessary so that the integration can continue to modify or synchronize the incidents escalated by the original user account.
You can refer to the Playbook Designer Guide for more information about simulations.
Splunk admin role for the user who installs and sets up Resilient Add-On and for all other users that need to add the Add-On as an Alert Action or an Adaptive Response action for a correlation search.

It provides CIM compliant field names, eventtypes and tags for NetFlow Optimizer data.
The Add-on can also be used to generate sample events for testing purposes, it contains samples of netflow data and config files for the event generator.
Setup after installation - Splunk Enterprise:

The TA-netflow is expecting that the sourcetype of events sent from Netflow Optimizer would be set to ""flowintegrator"". To set it up please create the $SPLUNK_ROOT/etc/apps/TA-netflow/local/inputs.conf file, and add the following lines to it:
    [udp://10514]
    sourcetype = flowintegrator

By default NetFlow Optimizer events will be stored in main index. In case you want to use another index, please create the  $SPLUNK_ROOT/etc/apps/TA-netflow/local/indexes.conf file, and add the following lines to it:

        [flowintegrator]
        homePath    = $SPLUNK_DB/flowintegrator/nfi_traffic/db
        coldPath    = $SPLUNK_DB/flowintegrator/nfi_traffic/colddb
        thawedPath  = $SPLUNK_DB/flowintegrator/thaweddb

You also need to make sure your $SPLUNK_ROOT/etc/apps/TA-netflow/local/inputs.conf file contains the following:

        [udp://10514]
        sourcetype = flowintegrator
        index = flowintegrator


Restart splunk for the configuration changes to take effect.

Setup after installation - Splunk Cloud:

Set up the forwarding to your Cloud Instance, the recommended method can be found here:
https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Forwarder/latest/Forwarder/HowtoforwarddatatoSplunkCloud

The TA-netflow is expecting that the sourcetype of events sent from Netflow Optimizer would be set to ""flowintegrator"". To set it up, on the UF forwarding to the Splunk Cloud please create the $SPLUNK_UF_ROOT/etc/system/local/inputs.conf file if it does not exist, and add the following lines to it:

        [udp://10514]
        sourcetype = flowintegrator

[Optional] By default NetFlow Optimizer events will be stored in main index. In case you want to use another index, please create the index based on these instructions:
https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/latest/User/Manageindexes

On the UF forwarding to the Splunk Cloud please create the $SPLUNK_UF_ROOT/etc/system/local/inputs.conf file if it does not exist, and add the following lines to it, assuming that the new index was named flowintegrator:

Overview
The DLMA App for Splunk is a plug and play license monitoring app that will work out of the box for all current Splunk deployments. This app provides a granular overview of license usage over time for indexes, sourcetypes, and individual sources. It goes as far as allowing indexes to be assigned to groups to track data ownership and allow for a chargeback model if necessary.
Installation
The DLMA App for Splunk is an app that provides searches and visualizations and should be installed on a search head. The app will work in a standalone, distributed, or clustered environment. On a standalone search head place the app in ../splunk/etc/apps/ and restart Splunk or install from file directly from the web GUI. In a clustered environement place the app in.../splunk/etc/shcluster/apps/ on the Deployer and apply the cluster bundle to the search head cluster (splunk apply shcluster-bundle -target <shcluster-captain>:8089)
Requirements
The search head must have access to _internal index data for the license master in the environment. Users require access to _internal index in order to view data for most of the app. The app will have 1 scheduled search by default with the ability to configure an additional 4 searches for alerts. Follow Splunk recommended requirements for OS and hardware guidelines.
App Components
License Usage
The License Usage dashboard provides detailed trendline analysis of indexes, sourcetypes, and sources for time periods of the current day, last 7 days, and last 30 days. The dashboard allows for filtering down by index and sourcetype.
Owner Assigned Usage
The Owner Assigned Usage dashboard pulls information from a lookup table (license_owners.csv) that is populated by user input (the Lookup File Editor (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1724/) app is highly recommended for this but not required) and a scheduled search (dlma_data_owner_usage_sched_output) that by default will run once a day at 3:00AM. The dashboard will show 30 day average usage and yesterday's license usage based on indexes assigned to groups. The app contains the lookup table license_owners.csv which contains the base structure of the table. A single run of the scheduled search will populate the lookup table with all indexes listed under ""Unassigned"". To create a group add a row above ""Unassigned"" and provide a group name and index(es) it is assigned to. An email is optional but may also be inserted. Currently an index may only be assigned to one group and if a group is created an index must be assigned. If no index is assigned the group will be removed during the next scheduled run. If an index appears twice in the lookup it will be pulled out and assigned to the group that appears highest up in the lookup table.
Dashboards
Dashboards contains the views within the app. It currently has the two main pages ""License Usage"" and ""Owner Assigned Usage"", as well as a static dashboard called ""License Usage - 30 day summary"". This is a static 30 day version of ""License Usage"" and can be used to schedule summary exports. If you open that dashboard and select ""Export--Schedule PDF Delivery"" you can run it on a schedule and have it emailed to desired recipients. The source of the dashboard may also be editted to change the reports to different time periods as needed. Splunk by default retains the internal license information for 30 days.
Reports
Reports currently contains four searches labeled ""dlma_alert"" these may be opened and saved as alerts to run on a daily schedule. Each alert labeled dlma_alert_*_sourcetype_datachange provides monitoring to detect large increases/decreases in license consumption by a sourcetype. This currently can result in a high number of false positives due to it being an anomoly based detection and any spike/drops will affect the average used for a 30 day period. They are split into three categories since many organizations likely see changes in data traffic over weekend periods. The filtering section allows for setting percentage thresholds for changes in license consumption as well as filtering out of low volume sourcetypes where a small change in license usage will result in a high delta. The filtering may be adjusted to your needs at the end of the search by changing the search segment ""where diff>0.5 AND percentage>10"". The default setting is to ignore anything where the day to day difference is less than 0.5GB and the difference is less than 10 percent. 
In future iterations of the app the machine learning toolkit may be implemented to look at changes in license consumption. The other alert named dlma_group_exceeded_quota will monitor the overall license pool and assigned quotas in license_owners.csv. To enabled any of the of the searches as alerts open the report in search and save as an alert to run daily and to trigger when results are >0. Please note for the exceeded quota search it will need to be scheduled after the dlma_data_owner_usage_sched_output is scheduled in order to get results for the previous day and not results for the day before yesterday. The default schedule for dlma_data_owner_usage_sched_output is 3:00AM daily.
The other search in the reports section is dlma_data_owner_usage_sched_output. This is the search used to populate the lookup table license_owners.csv and powers the Data Owner Usage page.
Alerts
Will be populated if any alerts saved searches from the Reports section are converted to alerts.
License_Owners.csv

A custom Splunk command that translate or resolves a URL/DNS into IPv4 address.
by morethanyell (daniel.l.astillero@gmail.com) <--- accepts beer
 
Usage
The search below shows a pretend index and sourcetype about VPN logs. The events don't have (natively) the IP address resolution of the URLs. Splunk engineer Chloe is interested in the ip address equivalent of the URLs. Thankfully, the dnsresolver command solves her problem. She pipes it in and gets the ip address out of the URL!
 
index=vpn sourcetype=vpn:urls
| stats sparkline as visits_over_time dc(user) as total_users by url
| dnsresolver inpf=url outf=ip
| sort 10 - total_users
| table url ip visits_over_time total_users
 
Installation

Step 1: Download the Splunk app
Option 1: Splunkbase. Download the app from Splunkbase https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6114/
Option 2: Github. Download the app from Github https://github.com/morethanyell/dns-resolver-splunk-ta


Step 2: Download the Splunk SDK Python from Github https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-python
Step 3: Copy the directory splunklib from Splunk SDK Python and then paste it in the /bin folder of DNS Resolver app (TA-dnsresolver)
E.g.: $ [sudo] cp -R ~/splunk-sdk-python/splunklib $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-dnsresolver/bin/
Where $SPLUNK_HOME is the install-location of your Splunk isntance, e.g. normally in /opt/splunk/ for Linux boxes


Step 4: Ensure the permission and ownership of the entirety of the app / directory TA-dnsresolver
E.g.: $ [sudo] chown -R splunk:splunk $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-dnsresolver/
Or whatever user is preferred over splunk:splunk


Step 5: Restart your Splunk instance
E.g.: $ ~/bin/splunk restart



 
 
Disclaimer
This is not a ""WhoIs"" app. There are probably other solutions out there that address the problem and already work. I built this app to keep myself from rusting. Also, when I searched about similar solutions, I eventually realized that most of the existing ones are ""lookup table dependent"". I wanted to come up with a solution that is live—ad-hoc—searching the DNS resolution provided by the local machine's DNS provider using Python library socket. With that, it is safe to say that this could be a lot slower than other a lookup-based DNS resolution Splunk apps. I tested this against a 1000-row CSV file and got around 18 seconds in average.

This add-on allows for indexing of metadata about Google Drive usage within an
organization. It captures audit events such as file creation, access, and
deletion.
It also serves as an example for using OAuth to authenticate a modular input.
More information can be found in Splunk's
Developer Guidance.
Installing
To use this add-on, you must first create an project in the
Google Developers Console

Create a new project, giving it whatever name suits your needs.
In your new project, click on APIs & auth -> Credentials in the nav bar.
Click the Add credentials button and select OAuth 2.0 client ID
Follow the prompt to create a product name for your consent screen
Select an Application type of Other, give it a name and press Create
Take note of your client ID and secret

Now set up the input in Splunk:

As an admin, go to the Settings menu and select Data inputs
In the Google Drive Activity Stream row, click Add new
Give your input a descriptive name and remember it, as we will need it when
   authorizing in the next step.
Click More Settings
Set the interval to the rate at which you want to query Google Drive.
   86400 (24 hours) is a good value.
Set the sourcetype to google:drive:activity


Save the configuration

Finally, we need to authorize the input. At the command line:

Ensure that the environment variable $SPLUNK_HOME is set to your Splunk
   installation directory

Run the following command (split into multiple lines for clarity):
$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk cmd python
    $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/splunk-add-on-google-drive/bin/configure_oauth.py
    <input name> <client ID> <client secret>
This will give you a URL that
you can copy and past into a browser. Once you authenticate with your Google
username and password you will get a key that you can then paste into the
prompt.
3. Go back to the input you created above and disable and reenable it to kick
   off the modular input process immediately.

Important warnings:
This app allows changing of files just like you are on the filesystem; it should be used very carefully in any environment that you care about.

Do not use this app on Search Head clusters to change files becuase it won't sync changes to cluster members 
This app does not automatically update the Splunk running config (except for properties like search-time extractions which
Splunk does regularly re-read)
There are no built-in restrictions on viewing secrets files or passwords. Don't make this app available to 
users who should not see that sort of thing
There are also no restrictions that prevent editing files in default/ folders. You should follow normal Splunk 
best practices and only edit the /local/*.conf files or files in default/ if you are the developer of that app
When performing file operations, this app inherits the permissions of the user account that is running Splunk.
All Splunk apps inherit the permissions of the Splunk user and can do things without your knowing. If 
you care about your Splunk instance, you should code review all apps before installing them
Don't run Splunk as root. If you do, this app can allow you to run commands as root which is very dangerous
Please don't waste time trying to get this installed on Splunk Cloud

There are examples of how to create common custom actions for the home tab (reload deploy-server, bundle push etc).  Look at the file  ./etc/apps/config_explorer/default/config_explorer.conf.example
Is your server a deployment-server or search head cluster deployer, and you would like to use btool on the apps that are pushed? If so, read etc/apps/config_explorer/default/config_explorer.conf.example.
There is some basic audit logging here: 
index=_internal source=""*config_explorer.log""

I am a Splunk Professional Services consultant working for JDS Australia (https://www.jds.net.au), in Brisbane Australia. 
Using git auto-commit
Before enabling the git auto-complete feature you must first create a git repository somewhere. For example: 
$ cd /opt/splunk/etc
$ git init
You will probably also need to set a username and email address for config_explorer to use for commits:
git config user.name config_explorer
git config user.email config_explorer@example.com
If you wish to use a non-standard git repository location, you can set these environment variables:
export GIT_DIR=/opt/splunk/.git/
export GIT_WORK_TREE=/opt/splunk/
You will need to consider your .gitignore file. If your directory already has .gitignore files in it, you 
may instead need to make a .gitignore file that ignores deeper nested .gitignore files.
Finally, if you want to push changes to an external repo, I would recommend you create a script input 
to do so, or alternatively, see my custom git app here: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4182/
Locking it down
In order to prevent file editing semi-permanantly, set write_access = false  and hide_settings = true.
This will prevent being able to change settings until someone changes files directly on the filesystem.

You must use a platform that supports Nodejs (which ships in the box for Splunk).
Make sure the SPLUNK_HOME environment variable is pointing to the root directory of your Splunk instance.
If your Splunk Web is located behind a proxy server, please configure the HTTP(S)_PROXY environment variable.

Usage

Open the Splunk web interface and go to Settings -> Data -> Data inputs
Add new data input for Auth0 app specifying name, domain, global client ID, global client secret and interval (under ""More settings"" section)


Global client ID and secret can be found from https://docs.auth0.com/api

Troubleshooting

File location for latest log checkpoint: $SPLUNK_HOME/var/lib/splunk/modinputs/{AUTH0_DOMAIN}-log-checkpoint.txt
This is used to keep track of the last log entry imported. If you delete it, the App will import all logs available on your Auth0 instance. This might result in duplicate events if you don't delete them beforehand.
App Log files:
$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/audit.log
$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log



Erase data

Open the Splunk web interface, go to Settings -> Data -> Data inputs -> Auth0 and delete the data input
Delete log checkpoint file: $SPLUNK_HOME/var/lib/splunk/modinputs/{AUTH0_DOMAIN}-log-checkpoint.txt
Run these queries:
Remove all Auth0 events: sourcetype=""auth0_logs"" | delete
Remove specific data input events: source=auth0://{DATA_INPUT_NAME} | delete

What does this app do?
This app allows you to back up and use version control to manage your Splunk knowledge objects, such as saved searches and macros.
Why?
Splunk (as of the time of writing in January 2019) has no native ability to use version control on its knowledge objects. This can lead to issues where an object is accidentally changed or deleted and there is no way to restore them beyond using OS-level backups, which are difficult to use in a search head cluster.
How does the app function?
The app uses two modular inputs to back up and restore configurations, Splunk Version Control Backup (or splunkversioncontrol_backup) and and Splunk Version Control Restore (or splunkversioncontrol_restore).
The backup portion of the app provides a Splunk modular input with the ability to serialize various Splunk knowledge objects into JSON format, which is then stored in a remote git repository and tagged based on each change to the backup.
These two inputs do not have to be on the same machine, however, they must be pointing to the same git repository and the gitTempDir must be unique on the filesystem if sharing the same machine.
The restore portion provides a Splunk modular input and a dashboard (SplunkVersionControl Restore) that can be used to request the restoration of a knowledge object.
How do I restore a knowledge object?
Use the SplunkVersionControl Restore dashboard to request that a knowledge object be restored to a prior version. You must be the author of the knowledge objects you wish to restore, or have the admin role. The application with the knowledge object in it must still exist on the Splunk server.
There are two unique dashboards with two different restoration methods, the original version is described below:
When a knowledge object restore is requested the dashboard (SplunkVersionControl Restore) outputs the knowledge object information to a lookup with the definition splunkversioncontrol_restorelist. The modular input then triggers the restore based on the contents of this lookup, the modular input either creates or updates the knowledge object with the requested git tag, or logs the failure to find the object in the logs.
Note that the above option is the option used with Splunk Cloud, the below option can be used on on-prem instances...
The newer dynamic version follows a similar process, but instead of adding the knowledge object restore information to a lookup file it runs a Splunk custom command postversioncontrolrestore that hits a REST endpoint on either a local or a remote server.
The REST endpoint then performs a few functions:
- Queries the source system and passes in the authentication token of the current user, this includes restore information and the splunkversioncontrol_restore input stanza name
- The remote system then sends a query back to the source ip it received the request from, using the token to check the username logged in
- The remote system then looks up the login information for the relevant splunkversioncontrol_restore input stanza and runs a remote query against it
- The said remote query runs a saved search named Splunk Version Control Audit Query POST
- To prevent issues just before running the above query there is a sleep period involved (configurable via the splunk_vc_timeout macro)
- If the report confirms the relevant user did indeed request a restore of some kind, the restore continues
- The restore now followed the previous process from this point triggering a restore process
- If multiple users attempt to run the restore at the same time, one of them will receive an error to advise a restore is in progress and to try again later
Security Concerns
The ability to restore/create configuration opens up a few obvious issues:
- What if the lookup file storing the list of objects to restore and the user who is performing the restoration is manually edited to add additional rows?
- What if a user attempts to restore the objects of another user?
- What if a user attempts to restore an object but re-own it to a different user?
To address these issues, a report named ""SplunkVersionControl Audit Query"" runs a query against the audit logs to determine if the lookup was updated by the saved search ""SplunkVersionControl AddToLookup"". This audit query returns a username and a time (it looks back/forwards one second from when the lookup was created).
The restoration script then validates that the username entered in the lookup file and the time match those found in the audit log. If they do not match then the restoration is rejected.
If you are using the dynamic version of the restore dashboard (custom command postversioncontrolrestore, an alternative report named ""Splunk Version Control Audit Query POST"" runs to check the audit logs, this report determines if the restoration request was made by the user in question. The report returns 0 or more results and if it returns results for the particular user, the restore proceeds.
Due to the above there is the possiblity that multiple users may trigger a restore while a restore is in progress, a kvstore is used to prevent this from occurring and an additional restore attempt when the restore process is in progress results in an error message to try again.
If a user attempts to restore the objects of another user, or attempts to restore the objects as a different user, this is allowed if the user has the admin role (which is determined by the saved search ""SplunkVersionControl CheckAdmin"").
Why use a lookup file and not trigger a remote command execution?
A custom command named postversioncontrolrestore and the accompanying dashboard splunkversioncontrolrestore_dynamic were created for this purpose in version 1.0.7
However this version wil not work in Splunk Cloud as it would require connectivity to an on-prem instance that can perform the backup/restore modular input functions
What is required for this application to work with a remote git repository?
The following assumptions are made:
- git is accessible on the command line, this has been tested on Linux & Windows with git for Windows installed
- git is using an SSH-based URL and the remote git repository allows the machine running the SplunkVersionControl application to remotely access the repository without a username/password prompt (i.e. SSH keys are in use)
- git will work from the user running the Splunk process over SSH, note that on Windows this will be the system account by default, on Linux the splunk user
- the git repository is dedicated to this particular backup as the root / top level of the git repo will be used to create backups 
Do the modular input backup and restore tasks need to be on the same Splunk instance?
No. However, the backup/restore modular input must have access to its own git temporary directory on the OS filesystem, the temporary directory should be unique for both backup and restore operations
When will a full application backup occur?
During the first run of the script (at which point the lookup file is empty) all applications and all objects will be backed up.
During each subsequent run of the script, if an application is found in the Splunk system but not on the filesystem then the backup of all objects within that application will occur
Otherwise an incremental backup of knowledge objects occurs (see below)
What gets backed up on each modular input run (incremental runs)?
There are two searches used to determine ""what"" has changed since the last run of the modular input:
- SplunkVersionControl ChangeDetector Non-Directory
- SplunkVersionControl ChangeDetector Directory
These two searches are passed in an epoch value, they then return a list of applications and the type of config that has changed.
For example if application search has had macros changed, then all macros in the search app will be backed up, however the savedsearches/dashboards/et cetera will not be backed up unless at least one of them in that app has changed.
How does the version control work?
Each backup run that results in more than 0 file changes will auto-commit all changes into git and tag with the current date/time including the minute of the hour. This will create tags such as 2019-01-10_0136, these tags can later be used to ""restore from"" in the ""SplunkVersionControl Restore"" dashboard.
The tags are recorded by outputting the tag list into the lookup definition splunkversioncontrol_taglist within the app, this same lookup definition is read by the dashboard to list available tags to restore from.
How will the restore work?
The restoration is based on a git tag, the relevant tag is checked out on the filesystem after running a git checkout master; git pull command.
Once checked out, the app/user/global directories are checked (depending on which scope was requested) to see if there is a relevant config item to restore, if found the remote object is either updated with the contents of git or created if it does not exist. By default the knowledge object is created with the same username that was in the backup, however there is an option on the SplunkVersionControl Restore dashboard to override the user on restoration, this is only able to be done by a user with an admin role.
What other lookup files are used by the app?

splunkversioncontrol_globalexclusionlist, this lookup definition records a list of excluded applications
splunkversioncontrol_restorelist, this lookup definition records what must be restored by the restore modular input (this is used by the non-dynamic dashboard)
splunkversioncontrol_taglist, this lookup definition records the tags available in git

Where are the logs?
On a Linux-based system
- /opt/splunk/var/log/splunk/splunkversioncontrol_restore.log -- this log will contain information about the splunk restore modular input
- /opt/splunk/var/log/splunk/splunkversioncontrol_backup.log -- this log will contain information about the splunk backup modular input
- /opt/splunk/var/log/splunk/splunkversioncontrol_postversioncontrolrestore.log -- this log contains information about the | postversioncontrol command
- /opt/splunk/var/log/splunk/splunkversioncontrol_rest_restore.log -- log log contains information about hits to the REST endpoint /services/splunkversioncontrol_rest_restore
Or the internal index which also has these log files with the sourcetype splunkversioncontrol
Installation guide
Standalone instance

Install this application on the Splunk standalone instance, if you are going to access a remote instance please ensure you can access the remote instance on port 8089
Create a new git repo and initialise the repo (it can have a README or can it be empty, but it must be at a point where the master branch exists)
The server doing the git backup must have SSH access to the repo without a username/password (in other words you need to have the SSH key setup so a git clone/git checkout/git push) all work without a prompt for credentials as the OS user running Splunk (as the modular input will run as this user)
If running on a standalone server the modular inputs can be configured either on the current standalone server, or another remote server, the app will work either way
If errors are seen when creating the modular inputs see the troubleshooting below, or raise a question on SplunkAnswers for assistance
If you are running the newer splunkversioncontrol_restore_dynamic dashboard the macros splunk_vc_name, splunk_vc_url, splunk_vc_timeout may need customisation to match your environment. In particular the splunk_vc_name assumes you have called your SplunkVersionControlRestore modular input ""Prod"". See the macros section of this document for more information
Ensure the directory where the git repository will be cloned to is empty (i.e. the git clone can create it)
Ensure the git repository has at least 1 commit (i.e. it is initialized and a git checkout master will work if you clone the git repo)
Ensure the git repository is not shared with anything other than this particular backup, as other items may be overwritten 
When you create the Splunk Version Control Backup (via Settings -> Data Inputs -> Splunk Version Control Backup), click ""More settings"" and set the backup interval you would like (tags will only be created if config has changed within Splunk)
When you create the Splunk Version Control Restore (via Settings -> Data Inputs -> Splunk Version Control Restore), if you are using the newer splunkversioncontrol_restore_dynamic dashboard then you do not need to set a run interval, if you are using the older method you want to run this on an interval to check if the lookup file has been updated and if a restore is required...

Search head cluster (on prem)

Install the SplunkVersionControl application on the SHC via the deployer as normal but do not configure the modular inputs on the search head cluster
Run the modular inputs on a standalone instance using the above instructions, and set the srcURL and destURL to a search head cluster member (or a load balanced REST port of the SHC)

Splunk Cloud

Install this application as per the standalone instance documentation above onto a non-SplunkCloud instance, install the VersionControl For SplunkCloud on the SplunkCloud instance
Note that in SplunkCloud the only option is the splunkversioncontrol_restore dashboard, the dynamic dashboard cannot be used in SplunkCloud
Configure the remoteAppName within the Splunk Version Control Backup & Splunk Version Control Restore modular inputs to ""SplunkVersionControlCloud""

How do I initialize a git repository?
github and other websites may offer to initialize the repository for you, if they do not the steps are usually similar to:
- git clone git@<website>:testing.git
- cd testing
- touch README.md
- git add README.md
- git commit -m ""add README""
- git push -u origin master
There are also many online resources to help with learning git
What do the parameters do?
Please refer to github or the README.md for the details
Additional notes
To get passwords into or out of the passwords.conf you may wish to use https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4013/
The context of the application name (default of SplunkVersionControl) will be checked first for the password, if that fails a query to all contexts /-/-/ will occur, realms will be ignored, only the name of the password is used for searching so any realm (or lack of realm) will work for storing the password
Macros
The following macros exist and are relate to the splunkversioncontrol_restore_dynamic dashboard
- splunk_vc_name - this macro is the name of the splunkversioncontrol_restore modular input name on the remote (or local) system where the restore occurs
- splunk_vc_url - this macro is the URL endpoint of the remote system, defaults to https://localhost:8089/services/splunkversioncontrol_rest_restore, you will need to change this if you have a remote instance performing the backup/restore operations, for example if you are on a search head cluster
- splunk_vc_timeout - this is the time delay between triggering the remote command and waiting for the _audit index to catchup with a log entry to advise the command was run, if set too short the restore may fail because the | postversioncontrolrestore search has not appeared in the _audit index yet
- sslVerify - defaults to ""False"", this can be set to the location of a CA file to be used by the python requests library to validate the SSL certificates in use
- requestingAddress - by default the REST endpoint splunkversioncontrol_rest_restore will make a HTTPS call back to the calling IP address, this overrides the address to call back, the default of False results in a call back to the requesting IP address which is used in most use cases 
- splunk_vc_ko_query, should be configured to point to an appname:searchname, the default is splunk_kom:splunk_vc_kom_audit_summary
Troubleshooting
In some Linux OS distributions an error similar to OPENSSL_1.0.0 not found may appear, os.unsetenv('LD_LIBRARY_PATH') appears to fix this however AppInspect does not allow modification of OS environment variables.
If you have this issue please add this into the python files to workaround the problem as required
Refer to this issue on github for more details
Note that you can run this from the command line if the logs are not getting populated:
splunk cmd splunkd print-modinput-config splunkversioncontrol_backup splunkversioncontrol_backup://<your_input_name_goes_here>
Finally the log files are mentioned under the ""Where are the logs?"" section of this document
Configuring the macro & savedsearch to work with the run_ko_query option
Please refer to the full README.md or github for all the details
Problems with the Splunk Version Control Restore or Splunk Version Control Backup modular input
Both inputs follow a similar validation process:
- Run a request against <srcURL>/servicesNS/nobody/<remoteAppName>/search/jobs/export?search=makeresults (where remoteAppName is SplunkVersionControl unless specified)
- Run the OS command (as the user running splunk) git ls-remote <gitRepoURL>
- If the above fails attempt to run ssh -n -o \""BatchMode yes\"" -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no <gitRepoURL>
- If the previous step was required re-attempt the git ls-remote step again
In 7.3.0 the Splunk process will kill -9 the modular input if it takes more than 30 seconds, if this occurs you can bypass validation by updating the inputs.conf file manually
Will this work on a search head cluster?
Yes but do not configure the modular inputs to run on the search head cluster, modular inputs run on each member at the same time which would not work well. What you want to do is configure a standalone server with the modular inputs for backup/restore and set the srcURL/destURL to the remote search head cluster member (or load balanced URL) on the REST port.
This would allow the modular inputs to run backup/restore and any customers to use the dashboard on the search head cluster member to request restoration of a knowledge object
Can I use this application on Windows?
Yes, please refer to the full README.md or github for all the details
Can I use this on a Splunk Cloud instance?
This application, no. But this application can be used to backup a SplunkCloud instance from a remote Splunk instance, the same remote instance could also be used to restore to the SplunkCloud instance.
To do this you will need to install Version Control For SplunkCloud on your SplunkCloud instance, and setup this application on a remote instance configuring an interval for both the Splunk Version Control Backup and Splunk Version Control Restore modular inputs

RECOMMENDED SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

Because this App runs on Splunk Enterprise, all of the Splunk Enterprise system requirements apply.

TOPOLOGY AND SETTING UP SPLUNK ENVIRONMENT
This Add-On can be set up in two ways:
1) Standalone Mode: Install the Add-on app on a single machine. This single machine would serve as a Search Head + Indexer + Heavy forwarder for this setup.
2) Distributed Environment: Install Add-on on search head and Heavy forwarder (for REST API).

Add-on resides on search head machine need not require any configuration here.
Add-on needs to be installed and configured on the Heavy forwarder system.
Execute the following command on Heavy forwarder to forward the collected data to the indexer.
  /opt/splunk/bin/splunk add forward-server <indexer_ip_address>:9997
On the Indexer machine, enable event listening on port 9997 (recommended by Splunk).
Add-on needs to be installed on search head for CIM mapping

UPGRADE
!! UPGRADING IS SUPPORTED WITHIN THE 2.X CHAIN.  IF COMING FROM 1.X, PLEASE REMOVE 1.X BEFORE INSTALLING 2.X!!
To avoid data duplication, follow below steps which will start data collection from where old app left off (for Events and Alerts)
Note: Accounts and Inputs must be created again.

Remove the old App. You can go to backend and simply remove the old app from ""$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/""
Restart Splunk
Install new Add-on (v2.1.0)
Open the ""Search & Reporting"" App and enter the following query to get the last fetched event's timestamp in epoch format.
index= sourcetype=netskope: timestamp=* | sort -timestamp | head 1 | table timestamp
Convert the given epoch timestamp into UTC formatted date using any online converter (e.g. https://www.unixtimestamp.com) 
When creating new Events or Alerts Input in new Add-on (v2.1.0), use the above UTC DateTime with the format as expected in the ""Start DateTime"" field.

CONFIGURATION
Follow the below steps for configuring Netskope Add-on for Splunk

From the Splunk Home Page, click on Netskope Add-on for Splunk and navigate to the Configuration section.
In the Account tab, click on the Add button to configure a new Account.
Enter the required details like Account Name (To uniquely identify accounts in Splunk), Netskope Tenant URL, Netskope API Token, Input Types(types of data you want collect for this account) and click on Save to save the configuration.
On the successful configuration of Netskope Account, Modular Inputs will be created automatically for selected input types in Disabled mode under Inputs page.
To use a proxy as part of the connection to Netskope, go to the Proxy tab and provide the required details. Don't forget to check the Enable option.
To configure the Log Level, got to Logging tab.
To change the Base Event Type, go to Add-on Settings tab. It will be the base search for all eventtypes(All the Dashboards of Netskope App for Splunk will refer to this Base Event Type to populate the data in the Dashboards)
To manage the Modular Inputs, navigate to the Inputs section.
If the user has successfully configured the Netskope Account, then Modular Inputs for selected Input types have been created automatically and should appear here.
User can enable/disable/edit/delete Modular Input by selecting specific Action.
If the user wants to manually create specific(Events/Alerts/Web Transaction) Modular Input, click on the Create New Input button provided on the top right.
Specify all required parameters needed to configure inputs like Name, Interval, Index, Netskope Account, Start Date Time, Query, Event Types, Alert Types, etc and click on Save to save the input configuration.
If you are collecting data in the custom index then Don't forget to update the Base Event Type under Add-on Settings of Configuration Section
e.g. index=main OR index=custom_index_1 OR index=custom_index_2

ALERT ACTION
Netskope App For Splunk v2.1.0 provides 2 alert actions

Netskope File Hash Alert Action
Netskope URL Alert Action

These Alert Actions can be used to either add or remove items from the lists.

When configuring the Alert Action, User needs to select Netskope Account and Index, Users can choose action to take as either Add or Remove, Provide List Name (it should exist on Netskope platform) and Field Name of the search result that contains the value to update into a list.
Example savedsearches for these Alert Action is provided in disabled mode. Users can take reference from these to configure the Alert Action.
Sample Netskope File Hash Alert Action
Sample Netskope URL Alert Action

TROUBLESHOOTING
The input or configuration page is not loading.

Check log file for possible errors/warnings: $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log

URL List or File Hash List is not getting updated even after execution of alert action is completed.


Make sure the provided list exists on the Netskope Platform.


Check log file for possible errors/warnings: 

$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/netskope_file_hash_modalert.log

$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/netskope_url_modalert.log


If you get any error log stating that list size reached to maximum allowed size, remove unnecessary elements from the list as Netskope allows a maximum size of the list to be approximately 8 MB.


If you get any network-related error log (like Timeout, Unreachable or Max retry exceeds) then revalidate configured Proxy and Netskope Account.


Note: For ease in troubleshooting, you can use Alert Action Dashboard in ""Netskope App For Splunk"" which will show recent errors and other statistics.


Splunk ES is not getting any events generated by Alert Action execution.

Select ""notable"" as index parameter while configuring Alert Action, because many Splunk ES functionalities related to Adaptive Response works on ""notable"" index only.

Account and Inputs are configured but data doesn't appear in Splunk search or Dashboards

One of the possible causes for this problem is when a user has selected a different index to collect data. Splunk by default searches inside the main index and all the Dashboards of the Netskope App by default uses the main index.
To add your custom index to default search, navigate to Settings -> Roles -> Select the role -> Click the indexes tab -> Search for you custom index -> Check the Default checkbox -> Save
To populate the Dashboards of the Netskope App from your custom index, navigate to Netskope Add-on for Splunk -> Configuration -> Add-on Settings. Update the Base Event Type with your custom index.
e.g. index=main OR index=custom_index_1 OR index=custom_index_2

Data is not getting collected in Splunk

Go to the Search tab. Hit the following query index=_internal sourcetype=tanetskopeappforsplunk:log and check the results.
Verify the Query configured in Modular Inputs are valid and such events exist on the platform.
Check the log file related to data collection is generated under $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/ta_netskopeappforsplunk_<input>.log.
To get the detailed logs, in the Splunk UI, navigate to Netskope Add-on For Splunk. Click on Configuration and go to the Logging tab. Select the Log level to DEBUG.
Disable/Enable the input to recollect the data.
Check the logs. They will be more verbose and will give the user insights on data collection.

Splunk Monitoring Console

Check the Monitoring Console (>=v6.5) for errors
Visit the Application Health dashboard

If you are still having problems, use the Command line and run this command to generate diag and send to Netskope Splunk Support

$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk diag --collect app:TA-NetSkopeAppForSplunk

If the Splunk Instance is behind a proxy, Configure Proxy settings by navigating to Netskope Add-on for Splunk -> Configuration -> Proxy
EVENT GENERATOR

Netskope Add-on For Splunk is provided with sample data that can be used to generate dummy data. To generate events the Eventgen app must be installed. The app and instructions can be found at https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1924/. This app should not be installed on a production system unless you understand the ramifications of generated data being mixed with production data.

UNINSTALL ADD-ON
To uninstall add-on, user can follow below steps: SSH to the Splunk instance -> Go to folder apps($SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps) -> Remove the TA-NetSkopeAppForSplunk folder from apps directory -> Restart Splunk

Restart the Splunk platform.You can navigate to Settings -> Server controls and click the restart button in splunk web UI or use the following splunk CLI command to restart splunk:

$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk restart



TEST YOUR INSTALL


Once  Add-on app  is configured to receive data from CNAE, The main app dashboard can take some time before the data is populated in all panels. A good test to see that you are receiving all of the data is to run this search after several minutes:
index=""[your index]"" or ""main"" | stats count by sourcetype


In particular, you should see this sourcetype:
* cisco:candid:events
If you don't see these sourcetypes, have a look at the messages output by the scripted input: collect.py. Here is a sample search that will show them:
index=_internal component=""ExecProcessor"" collectCandid.py ""CNAE Error:"" | table _time host log_level message
Troubleshooting

Q. Fabric dropdown is not populating with Fabric Names.

Run below search in All Time to populate the lookup with all fabrics.
sourcetype=""cisco:candid:events"" component=smart_event_details cnae_host= fab_id= | dedup fab_id | table cnae_host, fab_id, fabric_settings_dto.unique_name | rename cnae_host AS ""NAE Host"" fab_id AS ""Fabric ID"" fabric_settings_dto.unique_name AS ""Unique Name"" | inputlookup append=T FabricIdMapping | dedup ""Fabric ID"" | outputlookup FabricIdMapping


Additional Features

The term Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) or Threat Intelligence (TI) may have different meanings for different people. I have no intention provide you my definition in this presentation. I just want to share the joys and pains on creating these summaries and my belief on the statement of “IR is guided by CTI and CTI lives on the information collected from IR”.
Each week’s Summary is prepared after quick and dirty review from various subscribed feeds or sources that I found. Those tactical and technical intelligence are manually updated to my MISP instance (https://cisp.org.hk). On each Friday, select feeds are extracted from the Dashboards which are pulling from the MISP instance.
The first time I aware the term Cyber Threat Intelligence can be dated back in 2013-14. I gave a presentation with title of “Tracing APT_163QQ”. In that presentation, I had identified the IOCs, such as: blackteae.com, nanmu20088@163.com, 315612477@qq.com, cnxinghang@163.com and a whole block C-class IP addresses in Hong Kong. These IOCs are plot on a data mining map with Maltego.
In 2016, I presented my work called Maltelligence (malware-intelligence) in Cyber Security Symposium. The tool I created can parse IOCs from published security blogs or pdf papers and store them in a database. The collected IOCs can be further enriched with linked technical data pulling from OSINT sources. 
The project is created with intention to allow malware/forensics analysts to perform correlation checks on attack campaigns launched against APAC region victims. That is absolutely a coincident, in the same conference, HKMA announcement the iCAST framework which caused the term - Threat Intelligence creeps into the minds of Hong Kong information security professionals.",Version 1.2.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/42311112-1e77-11eb-a5e7-02fa7700cf1c.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,171,0,splunk,1,1,Frankie Li,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/ran2ran2,"Products: Splunk Enterprise

CS Toolkit App Instructions v2.6.0:
Before using version 2.6.0 of the app please carefully read these instructions:
The CST app is collecting Splunk's internal data to help you understand how Splunk is used in your organization. 
For that, the app is using a summary index. The default summary index name is ""cst_summary"".
If you wish to use a different name for the summary index, pleae follow these steps:
    - Create a new summary index with your chosen name
    - In the CST app, change the definition of search macro cst_summary_index to: index=<your_new_summary_index_name>
The new Adoption Analysis Dashboards provide insights on application usage and content creation. 
Before using the app for the first time, run the following summary searches:
(Settings-->Searches,Reports, and Alerts-->App:CST2.6)
  - History collect adhoc searches
  - History collect app access
  - History collect dashboard access
  - History collect events meta data
  - Daily collect app metadata
  - Daily collect dashboard metadata
  - Daily collect savedsearch metadata
  - Daily collect events metadata
Once these searches have finished successfully the CST summary index should be populated with data which will appear in the Adoption Analysis Dashboards",Version 2.6.4,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/b1a6c212-f400-11eb-a75e-025a6208ee83.png,Utilities,https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-software-license-agreement.html,"3,026",0,splunk,5,8,Splunk Works,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/splunklabs,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

Who is this app for?
This app is for dashboard designers who want to view trends in metrics over time.
How does the app work?
This app provides a visualization that you can use in your own apps and dashboards.
To use it in your dashboards, simply install the app, and create a search using timechart to provide the values to display.
Usecases for the Animated Chart Visualization:
- Displaying server status based on CPU, Memory, I/O, or Disk usage over time
- Showing customer satisfaction ratings over time
- Viewing a single metric by host over time
Supported Fields:
Animated Charts Viz is designed to use the output from | timechart. Use the following fields in the search:

_time (required) The time period for the event. If no time value is supplied, the first field is used for the slices.
<category 1> (required) The name for the value, e.g host, and the actual value.
<category 2> (optional) The name for the value, e.g host, and the actual value.
<category 3> (optional) The name for the value, e.g host, and the actual value.

Example Search
index=_internal earliest=-24h@h latest=now
| timechart span=15m count by sourcetype

Tokens
Tokens are generated each time you click an item. This can be useful if you want to populate another panel on the dashboard with a custom search, or link to a new dashboard with the tokens carying across.

NameThis is the name of the selected item. Default value: $ac_name_token$
Value  This is the value of the selected item you clicked. Default value: $ac_value_token$
Time Slice  This is the current time slice of the visualisation. Default value: $ac_time_token$

Release Notes
v 1.0.0
Initial Version
Issues and Limitations
To reduce the impact to browser resources there is a limit of 100 time slices (rows of results). You can reduce how many rows are generated by increasing the span of the | timechart command. E.g. | timechart span=1h for 1 hour increments. Any rows after the 100th are ignored.
Tokens like $click.value$ are not supported, use the tokens in the options popup instead (defaults: $ac_name_token$, $ac_value_token$, $ac_time_token$). Otherwise, drilldowns work as normal.

As part of this law, US pharmaceutical supply chain stakeholders are required to confirm the authorized status of trading partners for transactions and information disclosures, even when there is no prior business relationship.While larger Authorized Trading Partners (ATPs) have connectivity solutions in place, newer and smaller ATPs have not traditionally participated, including tens of thousands of dispensers. This complicates the path of the US pharmaceutical supply chain path to unlock the full potential of the interoperable system mandated by DSCSA.XATP is a blockchain-backed framework for ATP authentication and enhanced verification in a real-world pharmacy with genuine drug packages. Using just a mobile phone, dispensers can submit supporting documentation to authenticate their identities, and scan 2D drug barcodes to submit drug verification requests to manufacturers. Manufacturers authenticate the identity of requesting dispensers with verifiable credentials and respond to verification requests. These responses can be used to create Product Verification Certificates to support saleable returns.",,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/9c271ee8-6c77-11eb-b2f3-022786c46691.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance, Utilities",,2,0,splunk,0,0,Alex Colgan,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/alexcolgan,
https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3347,2022-01-10,07:52:42 AM,Postfix Add-on for Splunk,,"June 10, 2021","Customizations
Here are a few frequent customizations that can be applied to this app based on your specific environment and preferences.
 Short status_code vs DSN 
If you would prefer to see the short (3-digit) status_code instead of the Enhanced Mail System Status Codes or DSN (Delivery Status Notification), simply swap out the FIELDALIAS as show below:
Replace:
FIELDALIAS-status_code = dsn as status_code

With:
FIELDALIAS-status_code = status_code_short as status_code

Preferred value for 'src' and 'dest'
By default this app sticks with the traditional use of 'src' and 'dest' by returning either a fqdn or ip address. However, it may be preferable to change the order of preference or concatenate both values into one.
Please note that the use of ""unknown"" below is NOT because CIM datamodels replace null or missing values with the string ""unknown"". The ""unknown"" referenced here is for the literal string ""unknown"" present in the actual raw log events.
Settings
EVAL-src = coalesce(src, nullif(src_host, ""unknown""), src_ip)
EVAL-dest = coalesce(dest, nullif(dest_host, ""unknown""), dest_ip)

Alternate 1: Use a combination of host and ip
EVAL-src = if(isnull(src_host) or src_host==""unknown"", src_ip, src_host . "" ("" . src_ip . "")"")
EVAL-dest = if(isnull(dest_host) or dest_host==""unknown"", dest_ip, src_host . "" ("" . dest_ip . "")"")

Alternate 2: Prefer IP
(Because IP is almost always present, a simple field alias will be good enough.)
FIELDALIAS-src = src_ip AS src
FIELDALIAS-dest = dest_ip AS dest

In additon, it sets the class field to the protocol feature or component of WireGuard the event pertains to. These classes include cookie, keypair, handshake, keepalive, protocol, network, and peer.
It also sets an action that describes what WireGuard did with a packet, or what happened to a peer or interface.
Finally, it also assigned a level field that describes the (subjective) severity of the event.
The original release of TA-wg handles 37 different messages. The following chart is a list with classification:

Generate a WireGuard log file
On systemd, WireGuard does not write logs to a file by default. WireGuard writes to journald. We want to get journald to send the events to rsyslog so that we can write them to the file /var/log/wireguard.
These instructions assume that your Linux uses systemd. Distributions that use systemd by default include Arch Linux, CentOS, CoreOS, Debian, Fedora, Linux Mint, Mageia, Manjaro Linux, openSUSE, Red Hat (RHEL), Solus, SUSE (SLE), and Ubuntu. Most of these distributions also use rsyslog. If you are not using systemd, or you do not use journald, you will have to use some other method to get your WireGuard kernel logs into a file.
Turn WireGuard logging on
To get WireGuard to produce kernel debug logs (even after a reboot), create the file /etc/modprobe.d/wireguard.conf that contains:
options wireguard dyndbg

When you run modprobe wireguard, this configuration provides the same functionality as using:
echo module wireguard +p > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control

For this to automatically work, we must run modprobe wireguard before the WireGuard interface is brought up. In the interface configuration for WireGuard (e.g., /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf), place a PreUp directive into your [Interface] stanza to run modprobe:
[Interface]
Address = 10.0.0.1/32
ListenPort = 51820
PrivateKey = ...
PreUp = modprobe wireguard

There are other ways to accomplish this, like using kernel options, or having modprobe run automatically somewhere else. Use a different method if you prefer.
Change systemd-journald configuration
Edit /etc/systemd/journald.conf and add the line:
ForwardToSyslog=on

Restart journald:
systemctl restart systemd-journald

This will send kernel messages to rsyslog. Now, we can tell rsyslog to send WireGuard messages (specifically) to a file.
Change rsyslog configuration
Edit /etc/rsyslog.conf and add the line:
:msg, contains, ""wireguard:"" /var/log/wireguard;RSYSLOG_FileFormat
& stop

You may want to add a file, maybe 25-wireguard.conf, containing these lines under /etc/rsyslog.d/ instead. Your choice may depend on your distribution and your version of rsyslog and what you think is neat. My original advice was to use an expression-based filter, but I could not get one to work across the distributions I use, so I have reverted to an old property-based filter. The "";RSYSLOG_FileFormat"" makes rsyslog use an ISO 8601 timestamp with microsecond precision when writing WireGuard events. This is expected by the TA.
Restart rsyslog with the new configuration:
systemctl restart rsyslog

Now, WireGuard should be producing a /var/log/wireguard log file. The events should look like this (from an Ubuntu server):
2021-09-07T16:47:27.084162-05:00 wgserver kernel: wireguard: wg0: Receiving handshake initiation from peer 4 (97.109.74.206:42418)
2021-09-07T16:47:27.084343-05:00 wgserver kernel: wireguard: wg0: Sending handshake response to peer 4 (97.109.74.206:42418)
2021-09-07T16:47:27.084380-05:00 wgserver kernel: wireguard: wg0: Keypair 46027 destroyed for peer 4
2021-09-07T16:47:27.084408-05:00 wgserver kernel: wireguard: wg0: Keypair 46031 created for peer 4
2021-09-07T16:47:27.107125-05:00 wgserver kernel: wireguard: wg0: Receiving keepalive packet from peer 4 (97.109.74.206:42418)
2021-09-07T16:48:18.697292-05:00 wgserver kernel: wireguard: wg0: Sending keepalive packet to peer 4 (97.109.74.206:42418)
2021-09-07T16:48:51.465200-05:00 wgserver kernel: wireguard: wg0: Sending keepalive packet to peer 4 (97.109.74.206:42418)
2021-09-07T16:49:23.209223-05:00 wgserver kernel: wireguard: wg0: Sending keepalive packet to peer 4 (97.109.74.206:42418)

If the timestamp is different from the above, the TIME_FORMAT for the wireguard:kernel source type in props.conf will not match. If you specified RSYSLOG_FileFormat for your rsyslog output file, but your event timestamp is different, please contact this author with details about your distribution.
If you are using a different logging daemon and your syslog format is different, keep in mind that the two things that are required for these logs to be parsed correctly are the timestamp in %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%6N%z format at the start of the line and the presence of ""wireguard:(space)"" before the actual message.
Set up log rotation (optional)
If you use logrotate, set up log rotation for the new WireGuard log.
Edit /etc/logrotate.d/syslog or /etc/logrotate.d/rsyslog (or whatever your distribution calls the rsyslog configuration file for common logs) to include /var/log/wireguard.
Install the Technology Add-on in Splunk
Indexers
Install TA-wg on the indexers. It does not create any indexes. Make sure the index you want to send WireGuard events to exists before configuring the forwarders.
Search Heads
Install TA-wg on the search heads for search-time field extraction.
Forwarders
For any host that produces WireGuard logs, install TA-wg. Add a local/inputs.conf with a [monitor:///var/log/wireguard] stanza that overrides the index that you want to send WireGuard events to. (The default is index=default.) Enable the input by adding disabled = false to the stanza.
A typical stanza might look like this:
[monitor:///var/log/wireguard]
disabled = false

Website Data Extraction: setup an input that will extract data from a web-page and get it into Splunk
Data Preview: select data from a web-page that you would like to extract and preview results  to get a sample of the what the output would look like before you save the configuration
Website crawling: you can have the input crawl web-pages to automatically discover related content in other pages

Configuration
Initial setup
Once you install the app, it will ask you to set it up on the app configuration page. The setup only contains options related to configuring a proxy server. If no proxy server is used, you can just press save.
Creating an input
You will need to create an input to define the websites that you would like to extract information from. You can setup a new input using the wizard or using the page in Splunk's manager at Settings » Data Inputs » Web-pages or by using the GUI provided in the app itself. The most difficult part of configuring the app is making the CSS selector that will capture the data you want. See W3schools for information on how to create CSS selectors.
You can usually ignore the ""Output"" section. This is only necessary if you want to name the fields that the input will get based on content within the page (see ""Can I use attributes to set the field names?"" for details).
The ""Authentication"" can be left blank unless the web-page requires authentication. Only HTTP authentication is supported at the current time.
Known Issues
The UI shows matches for a selector does preview shows none and the input matches nothing
The preview window may show that a selector matches in the UI even though the selector doesn't match when executed in preview due to the fact that web-browsers sometimes manipulate the HTML before rendering it. This can happen sometimes when tables do not have a tbody element (which they are supposed to). The browser adds the tbody element even though it doesn't exist in the original HTML.
To fix this, you can do one of the following:

Use a selector that matches the original HTML even though it doesn't match in the preview page
Make your selector more generic (like converting ""font > table > tr"" to ""font table tr"")
Making a selector that matches both (like ""font > table > tr,font > table > tbody > tr""

FAQs
See the links below for answers to frequently asked questions:
Can I specify more than one selector (to match different things on a single page)?
Can I use attributes to set the field names?
I changed the sourcetype and now the match field is no longer a multi-value field; what do I do?
The input isn't extracting content, even though I can see it in my web-browser

Dependencies:
The app requires the following addons available from Splunkbase :

Google Maps (http://splunk-base.splunk.com/apps/22365/google-maps)

You do not need to install these addons if you do not wish to use the geo location features. The dashboard will not render properly without these addons on some pages.
You may have to add data inputs if you are not exporting the logs with default settings. The default settings that are configured in the Barracuda Splunk app are:  

Connection type either TCP/UDP.  
Port 514.

https://github.com/fwijnholds/ta-ubiquiti-support/wiki/Ubiquiti-Support
Installing and configuring Ubiquiti add-on for Splunk the TLDR version.
To get this TA working in your home environment. Just create a UDP input and make sure the sourcetype is called ubnt. The TA will do the rest oob. If you do want to do some more advanced stuff keep reading:
Installing and configuring Ubiquiti add-on for Splunk with ES
To use this TA with Enterprise Security some configuration is required. Datamodel acceleration at scale requires from the deployment that data is assigned to indexes by it's cardinality. As Sourcetype is assigned by input in Splunk there are 2 ways achieving this split. One is using transforms.conf in conjuction with a props.conf, the other is by having an intermediate like a syslog server do the splitting into files. A UF can assign sourcetype input.
Method 1:
If you want to use this add-on on a single instance, with full CIM compatability follow these steps:
Download transforms.conf-single and rename to transforms.conf. 
https://github.com/fwijnholds/ta-ubiquiti-support/blob/master/transforms.conf-single.conf
This file holds the configuration which rewrites the sourcetype based on a patern match, and routes the traffic to the correct index.
Download props.conf-single and rename to props.conf. https://github.com/fwijnholds/ta-ubiquiti-support/blob/master/props.conf-single
This file holds the configuration which rewrites the sourcetype based on a patern match, and routes the traffic to the correct index. Place transforms.conf in the ta-ubiquiti/local directory. Place props.conf in the ta-ubiquiti/local directory.
Download and install the org_all_indexes.spl
https://github.com/fwijnholds/ta-ubiquiti-support/blob/master/org_all_indexes.spl
note: This contains a standard set of indexes, the Splunk best practice for CIM you will note that it separates OS logs from Network logs and Security logs from Application logs. The idea here is to separate them for performance reasons, but also for isolation purposes-you may want to expose the application or system logs to people who shouldn't view security logs. Putting them in separate indexes prevents that.
Restart splunk
In the UI navigate to Settings -> Data Inputs
Add a new input for UDP
Enter the port which you would like to receive the data on
Select any ubqt sourcetype ie ubqt:fw, change settings to your liking with the exception of indexes. Or manually create inputs.conf
[udp://8514]
connection_host = ip 
sourcetype = ubnt 
index=ubqt
Method 2:
For deployment with a syslog server the recomendation is to use a Universal forwarder on your rsyslog or syslog-ng server. Have the syslog server write a file per sourcetype and have the UF assign the sourcetype to the specific logs. More information will follow.

TA-sendraw provides a custom Splunk search command, sendraw, for sending raw events over TCP or UDP. The underlying command uses the Splunk Custom Search Command protocol, version 2.
Supported Splunk Versions
The sendraw custom command will only work with 6.4.x or higher versions of Splunk. Version 2 of the Splunk Custom Search Command protocol was introduced as a technology preview with Splunk 6.4.
System Requirements
The sendraw command is a binary application written in Go. The TA has binaries included for the following platforms:
 * Darwin (OS X) 64-bit
 * Linux 64-bit
 * Windows 64-bit
Installation
Use normal Splunk installation procedures to install the TA. This includes installation through the Splunk UI or ""unzipping"" and copying to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps. The application is a Splunk .spl file, which can be renamed to .tgz and decompressed.
Released versions are available on GitHub: TA-sendraw
Configuration
Configuration of sendraw is made through a custom conf file, specifically sendraw.conf. This file must be available in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-sendraw/local. The local directory will need to be created after installing the application.
In the local directory, create the sendraw.conf file.
Here is an example configuration file:
[general]
#logLevel = debug
#timeout = 5s

[rawtarget:tcp]
server = your_server_ip:10520
protocol = tcp

[rawtarget:udp]
server = your_server_ip:10521
protocol = udp
General Stanza
The [general] stanza above is not required but it does include some commented configurations that can be used to modify the behavior of sendraw.
Valid values for logLevel include debug, info, warn, and error. The default is warn. Most log messages are either debug or error.
The default timeout is 10s (ten seconds). Valid, but not necessarily good, values are available from the Go time.ParseDuration function documentation.
""Target"" Stanzas
The ""target"" stanzas can be named anything. The examples append :tcp and :udp but a stanza could just as easily be [foobar].
Within a target stanza, it's pretty basic. Name the stanza what you want. Then add a server value which includes a hostname or IP address followed by a port number (separated by a colon). For protocol, choose either tcp or udp.
Windows Event Support for QRadar
An additional configuration option is supported specifically for sending raw Windows events from Splunk to QRadar. Add the following to a target stanza for this support:
windowsHeader = true
Usage
sendraw is a custom Splunk search command, so it's usually appended to a Splunk search. Here's a full example of a search command using sendraw:
index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd ERROR
| sendraw rawtarget:tcp
The base search, index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd ERROR, is simple and should work on nearly any Splunk system. If the search returns either zero records or many thousands, you may want to refine it to a managable number for your initial testing.
The final portion of the search, | sendraw rawtarget:tcp, is what calls the sendraw custom search command. A configured stanza name is the sole command argument.
Here is an example record that would get sent to the target host and port over either TCP or UDP:
06-05-2017 10:04:52.873 -0600 ERROR AuthenticationManagerSplunk - Login failed. Incorrect login for user: admin
This record is exactly like the _raw field value from a Splunk event.
sendraw can be used as an ad hoc search command but it will often be used to automate data integration with third-party servers using Splunk saved/scheduled searches.
Testing
To faciliate testing using a local Splunk instance, a related TA has been developed. TA-sendtest provides test target indexes, TCP and UDP Splunk inputs, and a sendraw.conf.sample similar to what was used in this documentation.
Further information on this application is available on GitHub: TA-sendtest
Troubleshooting
sendraw logs events at: $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/sendraw.log
These events can be searched with Splunk using: index=_internal source=*sendraw.log
Related Application
A similar application has been developed for sending CEF-formatted Splunk events to third-party servers.

Vault centrally stores, accesses, and distributes dynamic secrets such as tokens, passwords, certificates, and encryption keys. Vault also keeps application data secure with centralized key management and simple APIs for data encryption.
Vault Enterprise users can take advantage of this Splunk® app to understand Vault from an operational and security perspective, and build their own visualizations based on the provided examples.
Vault operators will find key performance metrics highlighted, both from Vault itself, and from the hosts Vault is running on.
DevOps teams will be able to see usage metrics, broken down by namespace, that tell them how different applications and teams are  using Vault. They can identify hotspots where many tokens or leases are being created, or identify unusual patterns of usage.
Security teams can use this app to explore Vault's security footprint. Reports show what methods are used to authenticate to Vault, the duration of Vault tokens, and the number of tokens with sensitive policies. The app shows the number of key-value secrets stored within Vault, which can be broken down by mount point or namespace.  Other visualizations help identify the source of long-lived authentication tokens, or the number of existing tokens with sensitive policies.
Vault Enterprise users can complete the Splunk app request form to request access to the app.
App contents
The app consists of seven pre-built dashboards, and four saved reports.
Cluster Health Summary provides an overall summary of the cluster's health and behavior, with links to other dashboards that provide more details. Show host health, token and entity creation rates, token usage statistics, and storage metrics.
Vault Operations Metrics from Telemetry includes the most important metrics that provide information on Vault’s operational health. Example metrics include ‘percent of memory in use’, ‘network IO’, and ‘duration of time taken by requests handled by Vault core’.
Vault Usage from Telemetry shows how to use the new usage metrics introduced in Vault 1.5 to understand token creation, lease creation, secret usage, and frequently-performed operations. This usage data can be filtered by a variety of criteria, including namespace, auth method, mount point, or time-to-live.

Vault Usage from Audit Logs shows summaries derived from Vault audit logs, such as the number of requests by path, entity, or IP address. We highlight the number of distinct errors, and provide specialized visualizations for accesses to key-value stores.
Vault Storage Metrics: This dashboard includes the most important storage backend metrics to monitor, when using Vault Integrated Storage or Consul.
Quota Monitoring plots metrics that were introduced in Vault 1.5 as part of the Resource Quotas feature, showing when rate-limiting quotas have been exceeded or the number of leases allowed has reached its maximum.
High TTL Explorer: This is a workflow-oriented dashboard for exploring the origins of high time-to-live tokens.
The saved reports available in the app show operation count (by mount point), operation latency, a timeline of errors, and details of the number of tokens per namespace and policy.
More information
The sources of data for the dashboards include: 
  * Vault telemetry
  * Vault audit logs
  * Telegraf; used to capture and forward Vault telemetry metrics and system level metrics.

uberAgent consists of two main components: the actual agent runs on the endpoints you want to be monitored, sending the data it collects to the configured backend either directly or via Splunk's Universal Forwarder. The second main component, implemented as a set of Splunk apps, provides dashboards, visualizations, searches, and reports.
The Agent
uberAgent's data collecting component is a lightweight agent that runs independently of any runtimes or frameworks. The agent's footprint is so small that it is truly unobtrusive on the monitored endpoints and does not affect user density.
Where other products rely on operating system sources such as performance counters, WMI, or similar unfiltered data, uberAgent comes with its own metrics. Instead of raw data uberAgent gives you information that matters (see uberAgent's list of metrics).
The agent is highly configurable: metrics can be turned on or off individually, the data collection frequency can be chosen freely, blacklists and whitelists (supporting regular expressions) allow for fine-grained control. This ensures that only data you really need is sent to the backend for indexing.
Browser Extensions
uberAgent's endpoint agent is complemented by browser extensions, which enable uberAgent to collect performance and usage metrics from web apps, too. Extensions are available for all major browsers.
The Splunk Apps
Multiple Splunk apps help process and visualize the data collected by the agent. The indexer app lives on Splunk indexers and mainly creates uberAgent's index and data input. Dashboard apps implement the user interface, providing different views into the collected data. uberAgent comes with two dashboard apps: one for uberAgent UXM and another for uberAgent ESA.
uberAgent's main apps are complemented by special-purpose apps that offer a different view of the existing uberAgent data, such as the uberAgent Helpdesk app.
Most dashboards are searchable and have extensive filtering capabilities to give you a fast and powerful way of isolating specific data. Time range pickers make it easy to go back to the exact time a problem occurred.
uberAgent makes full use of Splunk's advanced UI components to display a beautiful user interface that fluidly adapts to screen width and device type. As a result, it works equally well on a tablet as on a PC or Mac.

You must first download and build the latest source for SIGAR (1.7 trunk), which you can grab from https://github.com/hyperic/sigar . For your convenience, I've attached a linux build in the download.
For more on SIGAR, see http://sigar.hyperic.com/
To install, unpack package contents in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/
Make sure you've correctly built the python bindings for SIGAR. You can do this by first testing your system Python. Go to your Python shell and type ""import sigar"" - if you don't get any errors, then your Python bindings have been built correctly.
Splunk ships with its own version of Python. To ensure that Splunk uses the SIGAR bindings, either build SIGAR to install with Splunk's Python, or simply copy all the sigar files from your system's pythonX.x/dist-packages directory into $SPLUNK_HOME/lib/python2.6/site-packages/.
To test if Splunk's python can use Sigar, issue this command: ""$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk cmd python"" and then at the Python prompt ""import sigar"".
This first version gives you an easy way to track system memory changes. Future revisions will track CPU metrics. The python script that sends this data to Splunk, sigar4splunk/bin/sigar-perf.py, already includes some data on filesystems. I will create reports based on this data - or you're welcome to try your hand at it.",Version 0.2.1,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/image/default_icon.png,IT Operations,http://www.opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0,516,0,splunk,0,0,John Mark,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/johnmark,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

Overview:
Optiv Decept System is a Splunk App that monitors for unauthorized and/or malicious activity on your organization’s network. By placing several honeypots that listen on many ports at strategic locations, we can detect early stage attacks. The app can provide increased visibility to potentially malicious activity going on in the organization. 
Features:

Listen on several common tcp ports and report unauthorized activity to the app.
Capture keystrokes and network traffic from potentially malicious hosts.
Search and visualization features.
Low system requirements and easy install.

The data from ClientSessions maps to the Network Traffic data model.
Notes
If you are installing on a standalone instance set ""KV_MODE = none"" in local/props.conf for the enabled sourcetypes to prevent duplicate field extractions. If you prefer search time field extractions, instead set ""INDEXED_EXTRACTIONS = "" in local/props.conf for the enabled sourcetypes on a heavy forwarder or stand-alone instance.
Some things to be aware of that I ran into: 

There is a max page size of 1000 results per-page. The input validation is supposed to check that it does not exceed, but I have had good results with the default of 100. 
There is also rate-limiting in Prime by default, so I don't run any of the inputs more frequently than every 15 minutes (900 seconds). The Client Sessions input currently has a hard-coded setting to only pull sessions with a sessionStartTime in the past hour, so that should not be run more frequently than hourly.

Getting started
This app is not ""visible"" in the Splunk UI app menu. After installing the app, follow this process:
1. Do a search of any data and switch to the visualisation tab
2. In the top left, in the visualisastion menu, select ""Flow Map viz""
3. Open the ""Format"" menu then select ""Help""
4. There will be a link to the in-app documentation, which includes working examples

Usage
This visualisation expects tabular data, with specific field names. There are two kinds of row data that should be supplied: links and nodes.  The link data is identified by having both a from and to field, or a path field. The path field is delimited by three hyphens ""---"" and can include hops through multiple nodes.  The node data will have a node field. 
Example 1,  simple links using  from / to fields










from
to
good


users
loadbalancer

webserver1
1000


loadbalancer
webserver2
1500


loadbalancer
webserver3
500



Note that nodes are automatically created. 

Example 2, same output using path field









path
good


users---loadbalancer---webserver1
1000


users---loadbalancer---webserver2
1500


users---loadbalancer---webserver3
500



Shared links will have the fields ""good"", ""warn"" and ""error"" automatically summed together

Example 3, customise output by adding ""node"" rows.
For the users and loadbalancer rows, a custom label is set, along with a font-awesome icon and the label is moved underneath.

Its an unsual concept to have a single search that produces two different sets of data, however this can be easily performed using append. 
For example you can define all nodes and links in a lookup table and append it after all your search data like so: 
existing search | append [ |inputlookup my_table_of_nodes_and_links.csv ]

How to manually set positions




Double click a node disable its manual positioning.

Data domain
By default, the amount of particles shown is automatically ranged/scaled (using linear interpolation) based on the data supplied. The visualization finds the link that has the largest volume of (good + warn + error) and uses that as the upper bound. The formatter option ""Particles"" > ""Data domain"", allows manually defining the range that the data is expected to fall into. The value can be set either as a single value representing the maximum (min will default to 0) or a comma seperated pair of numbers (min,max).

Tokens and Drilldowns
Tokens will be set when clicking on nodes or link labels. Hit ""F12"" to open browser developer tools, then open the ""Console"" to observe how tokens are being set.
Nodes: $flow_map_viz-label$, $flow_map_viz-node$, $flow_map_viz-drilldown$, $flow_map_viz-type$
Links: $flow_map_viz-label$, $flow_map_viz-link$, $flow_map_viz-from$, $flow_map_viz-to$, $flow_map_viz-type$
Link labels can be used for drilldowns to other Splunk dashboards etc. However that as nodes can be dragged to reposition, these can't be used for drilldowns.
A work-around for drilldown on nodes, enable the ""Advanced"" > ""HTML Labels"" formatter option, and then set the ""label"" data field to include a html ""a"" tag to link to your required destination. E.g.
existing_query | eval label = ""<a href='search?q="" + drilldown + ""' target='_blank' style='text-decoration:none;'>"" + node_label + ""</a>""

Building a complex flow map using a lookup
Attemping to set the various node and link options can lead to a messy SPL query. A neat way to solve this is to build a lookup table of all the nodes and links, and then |append it to the end of your real data. If the same link pair exists in multiple rows, then the ""good"", ""warn"" and ""error"" fields will be summed. For other link customisations such as ""speed"" and ""width"" the last set property will take effect.
existing query | append [|inputlookup my_flowmap_config.csv]
Here is an search that will generate a template CSV file called ""my_flowmap_config.csv"":
| makeresults count=10
| fillnull value="""" node from to height radius opacity position icon good warn error color width distance speed labelx labely fromside toside tooltip label
| table node from to height width radius opacity position icon good warn error color distance speed label labelx labely fromside toside tooltip
| outputlookup my_flowmap_config.csv

The Distiamo solution is composed of two different technical approaches called Coarse Grained and Fine grained.
They can be mixed together to implement a Hybrid solution.
The Management App can be deployed on premise or on cloud on top of a Splunk Enterprise instance.
It is able to dialogue with Gateways or Locator hardware components.
Ingestion of Contacts data is performed through an HTTPS event collector that allows an external system to push
data into the system according to a predefined message structure.
The access control is managed by the platform through a Token generated by the system.
Contacts data ingested through this endpoint is indexed into a Splunk index (app_contacts_tracing) and mapped into a data model (arduino_covid_datamodel).
All the query and analysis of contacts is performed on top of this data structure.
The app exposes an endpoint for Gateways and Locators in order to get configuration parameters to be transmited to the Tags or to be used in the device itself.
The app depends on Arduino hardware to be connected to the system in order to gather data to be process and provide configuration data to the system.
After installing the app create an index with ID app_contacts_tracing.
Other Distiamo components:

Tags: wearable Bluetooth devices that allow tracing contacts responsible for the communication of the data collected from the tags
Locator: Bluetooth devices for the fine-grained (below 1m distance) contact tracing
Positioning Engine: the engine that estimates each Tag position, when detected
Contact Tracing Engine (plugin): the application that receives all position data and elaborates them to realize Social Distancing and Contact Tracing scenarios

Overview
The app provides a unique functionality - a dashboard that lets you select events associated with a specific index and sourcetype and generates the Great Eight props.conf stanza applicable at inputs and parsing phases in the forwarding and indexing tier. It also lets a user test and validate the generated attribute values by showing a preview of how it would look like after applying those generated attributes. Users also have the flexibility to edit the attribute values and then apply those edited values to the raw events to preview and test them. Once satisfied with the values, the stanza is shown in a panel exactly as how it would appear in the configuration file so you can copy it to a clipboard using the Copy to Clipboard button and manually paste it in the props.conf of the appropriate tier.
Why is this useful?
Medium to Large Splunk deployments have multitudes of data sources. There may be several data sources that might have been onboarded not following the standard practices. This might come back to bite later in the form of indexing latency, search sluggishness, premature bucket rolling as the data volumes grow. Currently analysing and visualizing if there is a problem with the parsing is largely done by Splunk admins via the Monitoring Console. This app aims to democratize the process by providing anyone a view to check if the data sources they own are hygienic and the sourcetypes homogenous.
Why not just use Add Data -> Data Preview?
Data preview is a valid option if you want to test out configurations for first-time onboarding of data sources. But it only does part of the functionality i.e. testing the parsing configuration. It doesn't have a suggest feature, not to mention the hassle of getting a log extract to upload/monitor first. In case the data source is already available in the index, you can simply leverage that in this app.
Besides this app can be used by regular user roles as well without having to give additional capabilities unlike Data Upload/Preview.
Installation and Configuration
This is a Search Head only app. Standard installation procedures apply for this app on a Splunk Enterprise deployment. This app is ready for use right out of the box. However it can be enriched further by editing the lookup propinator_data.csv if required.
Under the hood
The core logic is implemented by integrating a custom command propinator and a lookup table propinator_data.csv.
In case you are applying this command in an ad-hoc search query, you can generate the props by passing the required argument mode=suggest with the command.
See below how you can apply this in an ad-hoc query.
index=<your_index> sourcetype=<your_sourcetype> | head 100 | table _raw | propinator mode=suggest
Capability Enhancement
The lookup table propinator_data.csv is simply a knowledge object that holds a list of known time formats and their regexes. You can add new time formats into this lookup if required to enhance the capability of this app. Make sure to always append new rows to the lookup and not overwrite it. If you want to disable a particular row, just change the ignore column for that row to 1. Also remember to enclose the new values in double quotes.
Test Regex
Here's a handy search for testing the regexes.
index=<your_index> | stats latest(_raw) as _raw by sourcetype | appendcols [| inputlookup propinator_data.csv | stats list(re) as re] | filldown re | eval ts_matches = mvmap(re, if(match(_raw, re), mvappend(ts_matches,re), ts_matches)  ) | fields - re | eval count=mvcount(ts_matches)
Logging & Troubleshooting
Logging is integrated with Splunk under filename propinator.log and will be located in $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/. This log file will rotate on reaching 20MB size and will have 4 backup files named as propinator.log.1 to propinator.log.4.
It can be searched within Splunk like so:
index=_internal source=""*/var/log/splunk/propinator.log""
This log file will rotate on reaching 20MB size and will have 4 backup files named as propinator.log.1 to propinator.log.4.
The propinator custom command can optionally accept log_level=DEBUG as an argument to enable troubleshooting.
Limitations
Current version of the app is designed to tackle unstructured events, a future version may be developed that will also generate parsing configuration for popular structured events like XML, JSON etc. 
We have covered as much possible combinations of timestamp formats in the lookup, however it is recommended to keep the lookup file updated with more timestamps as and when a new one is encountered that couldn't be parsed by the app.
Word of Caution
Note that though the user has the option to select the no. of raw events to process, it may be prudent to NOT run this over 100s and 1000s of events to prevent the app from consuming more than required CPU and memory. For the app to stay true to purpose, it is assumed that the events that you select are homogenous in terms of event structure and format. This makes selecting a 100 events sufficient to generate the parsing attributes. In case multiple disparate log sources may be having the same sourcetype assigned due to the absence of best practices in onboarding, the app is designed to suggest parsing configurations for the most frequent format among the selected events within that time window. On the same note, while copying the generated stanza into a props.conf file in the indexing tier, you need to be aware that you could be replacing/overriding any existing parsing confs for that sourcetype. And the existing stanza might already be applied correctly for certain log sources but not applicable for others, make sure to have appropriate sourcetype name for the suggested props and make changes at the inputs.conf as well if required.",Version 1.0.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/c8816d00-1a31-11ec-88ff-4658bad4d143.png,Utilities,https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,42,0,splunk,5,3,Discovered Intelligence,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/DiscoveredIntel,"Products: Splunk Enterprise

Splunk Enterprise data analytics help organizations leverage the data that their infrastructure and security tools provide to understand their security posture, pinpoint and investigate risks, and create alerts and reports. Security operations teams must also rapidly respond to any identified threats, violations and attacks in a prioritized manner. Any delay in response can result in significant security risks. The integrated combination of the Forescout platform’s continuous, agentless device visibility, network access control, dynamic segmentation and workflow orchestration capabilities with Splunk Enterprise’s data mining and Splunk Enterprise Security (ES)'s security information and event monitoring (SIEM) capabilities provides a solution that maximizes insight, dramatically reduces risk and increases operational efficiency.  
Security blind spots are removed by having Splunk easily consume comprehensive information from Forescout such as:
•    Real-time inventory of all network connected virtual and physical devices across IT, BYOD, Guest, IoT and Operational Technology (OT), including new devices with an IPv6 address. Device data can also be sent without dependency on IP address for reporting flexibility. 
•    Endpoint information, such as device type, classification, network connection, operating system, applications, users, peripherals and much much more
•   More accurate user and location context by resolving overlapping IP addresses and layering tenant ID with IP address in meta data
•    Device security posture and compliance gaps
•   Authentication, access, tenant ID and network location information
•   Threat indicators on devices detected by vulnerability scanning
Use Cases
Capitalizing on Forescout's rich contextual information and policy-driven actions together with Splunk helps you tackle the following use cases.
Rapid anomaly detection and accurate trend analysis
Forescout discovers, classifies and assesses all connected devices; compiles this information in the Splunk CIM format and shares it with Splunk. The additional device information from Forescout includes user information, device type, device configuration, network access patterns over time, network location and security posture. Splunk correlates rich contextual data from Forescout with other data sources and uses this information for long-term storage, swift anomaly detection and accurate trend analysis.
Enhanced incident correlation and prioritization
Splunk correlates rich device context from the Forescout platform with other data sources to better identify and prioritize incidents. When Splunk receives alerts from other data sources about a suspicious activity on a device, it shares the information with Forescout. Forescout provides high-value user, network and device context to Splunk. Splunk leverages this additional insight to determine if a suspicious event is actually malicious or violates policy and escalates or reduces the severity of the event based on the device and user context, such as highly privileged or less trusted users.
Automated closed-loop incident response
Forescout scans all connected devices for indicators of compromise (IOCs) and policy violations in real time when alerted by Splunk. Through Splunk’s Adaptive Operations Framework, Splunk operators can initiate Forescout actions—such as isolating or quarantining potentially compromised or noncompliant endpoints depending on the severity of the violation. Forescout can also dynamically trigger policy-based mitigation and response actions until the deviant device is remediated. Forescout then delivers the results back to Splunk to close the loop. Administrators can view the entire lifecycle and final outcome of the event in the Splunk dashboard.
Architecture Overview

Forescout integration with Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud and Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) is enabled by the 
Forescout eyeExtend for Splunk module paired with the Forescout App for Splunk along with the Forescout Adaptive Response and Forescout Technology Add-ons for Splunk.   
The Forescout App for Splunk provides customizable, out-of-the-box queries and dashboards to visualize Forescout data in Splunk, displaying a wealth of information such as:
• Device compliance status
• User types (registered corporate users or guests)
• Device types connected to the network and connection details
• Patterns of network access over time
• Policy trends
• Forescout system health information
• Incident response action status
The Forescout Technology Add-on for Splunk is a required component to streamline data transfer between Forescout and Splunk Enterprise. This Add-on maps Forescout collected device properties to the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) and extracts events based on Forescout data. The Forescout Technology Add-on also maintains Forescout credentials for communications between Forescout and Splunk Enterprise. 
Support for Splunk Adaptive Operations Framework with The Forescout Adaptive Response Add-on

Splunk's Adaptive Operations Framework describes a complete action flow, which includes requesting an action be applied to an endpoint device and tracking the status of the action taken. 
This integration supports the Splunk Adaptive Operations workflow as follows:
-The Forescout App for Splunk maintains a list of available actions from the Forescout platform. Splunk can instruct the Forescout platform to respond to potential threats by applying any of these actions to endpoints that match search/trend criteria.
-To complete the action flow, the Forescout platform reports the status of actions applied to endpoints.
These closed-loop incident response workflows allow you to streamline security operations and minimize business risk by automating the incident management lifecycle with a complete audit trail that also helps with policy refinements.

The Splunk Monitoring App Focuses on the following areas:
Health Status – status of your instances, forwarders, data feeds, and internal messages.
License Overview – shows the status of your license usage, license trending, and index and indexer capacity - takes advantage of the Internal Events data model.
Resource Usage - uses the Introspection Usage data model for a look into Splunk and system resource usage.
Search Activity – illustrates what users are searching in your environment and allows you to easily identify poorly written searches.
Scheduler Activity – information regarding job schedules.
User Activity – information regarding user activity.
Available Indexes – shows what indexes and source types are in your environment with a custom contextual drill down capability that launches a new search with the index/sourcetype in question defined. This has proven very successful as users no longer have to run expensive exploratory searches to determine what indexes and sourcetypes are available to their role.
Indexes and Fields - Contains detail regarding field extractions for sourcetypes and the fields that are extracted.
Getting Started:
Once the app is installed a restart is required. After the restart you will need to run two of the scheduled saved searches avail_indexes and all_servers. These two lookups will gather information regarding your environment and are crucial to the apps functionality. If the all_servers lookup does not generate accurate information in your environment you will need to manually edit this. For 6.1.x environments enable the server_lookup_v6_1 saved search and disable the default server_lookup saved search. 
Other Gotchas:
There is an Internal Events and Introspection accelerated data model will will need to complete acceleration.
You can customized thresholds based on your license capacity. By default, the filler gauge is set to 10 GB.
Splunk instances running on Mac OSX do not generate Introspection data.
Each instance to be monitored will need to be a search peer so Splunk can collect the role information from that host. If it is not setup as a peer Splunk can still collect information regarding that host granted it is sending data to a host that is a Splunk search peer but will not show information generated from REST.
Currently only supported on Splunk 6.1+. To get this app functioning with 6.0.x you will need remove the panel tags from the xml views and remove any panel embedded time range picker as well as any multiselect inputs.

This Splunk app will connect to a RSA Netwitness Devices via REST API. It will poll the RSA Netwitness device(s) regularly to collect device stats.  
Screenshots

To install:

Extract to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/
Reconfigure as per below
Restart Splunk

The following Splunk search will provide any relevant error logs for this app:  
index=_* nwadmin.py sourcetype=""splunkd""

Make sure the REST interface is enabled on your RSA Netwitness device.
NOTE: Versions prior to 0.7 - SSL access to the REST interface requires the use of a hack
Please see http://splunk-base.splunk.com/answers/40255/does-splunk-for-netwitness-support-ssl-access-to-the-rest-api for more details
To troubleshoot connections to your RSA Netwitness device use, you can use any browser.
RSA Netwitness Appliance Logs Configuration
The configuration of log portion of this app is based on Splunk's native configuration settings. There's an example below but it won't necessarily apply to all environments. The only mandatory setting is ""sourcetype=netwitness_log"". For mode details see the How-to PDF included with the app
# [monitor:///var/log/netwitness.log]
# sourcetype = netwitness_log

Configure the following variables in nwadmin.conf.
Make sure you place it in $APP_HOME/local/nwadmin.conf to avoid overwrite during app upgrades:
# [<unique reference used for logging of app messages>]
# protocol=(http|https)
# server=<ip/hostname of device>
# port=<device port>
# type=(appliance|broker|concentrator|decoder)
# username=<username>
# password=<password>

You can have as many of these instances as needed, normally two per device (appliance + service) as per example below:
[decoder-12]
protocol=http
server=192.168.1.12
port=50104
type=decoder
username=admin
password=netwitness

[appliance-12]
protocol=http
server=192.168.1.12

An issue after upgrading the Slack Alerts app can cause an invalid redirect from the alert actions listing page to the setup page. Go to ""Manage Apps"" and click on ""Set up"" instead of using the Alert actions listing.
Alternatively - to fix it - you can remove the is_configured flag from $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/slack_alerts/local/app.conf and restart Splunk.
Logs
In order to investigate problems with the Slack alert action, you can check the logs of the
alert action.

Navigate to ""Settings"" -> ""Alert actions""
Click on ""View log events"" for the Slack alert action

You can also increase the verbosity of logs generated by the alert action by adjusting the

Navigate to ""Settings"" -> ""Server settings"" -> ""Server logging""
Search for the log channel ""sendmodalert""
Select logging level ""DEBUG""

NOTE: This will increase cause detailed logs to be produced for all alert actions and might have an
impact on system performance. It is not recommended to do this on a production system.
Manually trigger the alert action
You can manually trigger the slack alert action if you want to verify the configuration and/or preview different parameter combinations.
For example:
| sendalert slack param.channel=""#mychannel"" param.message=""Lorem ipsum""
Enter a simlar SPL query into the search bar in the search interface of Splunk to manually send a message.
Error Codes
In case of an error when manually triggering the Slack alert action, you'll notice an error code being returned (eg. Alert script returned error code 6.)
Here are the possible error codes returned by the slack alert action:


Error Code 2: Validation Failed

The app -- available on Splunkbase -- is the modern successor to the 2016 Voracity add-on to Splunk, and an alternative to using Splunk Universal Forwarder to index the data.  
The app functions as an invocation and integration point for the execution and use of different SortCL-compatible jobs and their results; i.e., 
IRI CoSort data cleansing and transformation
IRI NextForm data migration and replication
IRI FieldShield PII discovery and de-identification
IRI RowGen test data synthesis and population
The app launches these existing jobs -- usually created graphically in IRI Workbench, an IDE built-on Eclipse, -and automatically ingests and indexes the output data from those jobs into Splunk. From there, the data is ready for Splunk’s usual analytics, visuals and actions.
The app works by running any specified IRI job script as a modular input given its specified location. It also accepts and executes additional SortCL command line arguments to the script, such as /WARNINGSON, /STATISTICS, or another named /OUTFILE target. The data flowing to Splunk through the app should be specified in a structured record format.
Installing the IRI App for Splunk
There are two options to install the IRI app:
download the app from Splunkbase and install it via the “install from file” button within your Splunk instance; or, 
search for “IRI Voracity Data Munging and Masking App for Splunk” and have it installed directly.
Creating a Data Input / Modular Input
The input to Splunk is the output of a Voracity job. The first /OUTFILE target in the job must be set to stdout for the data to be indexed into Splunk. Additional command line arguments can be specified in a modular input, including additional /OUTFILE= sections to add other output locations in addition to the pipe into Splunk.
Select the Voracity app from the dropdown menu in the upper-left corner of Splunk. “Inputs” should be the default page of the app. To create an input, select the “Create New Input” button and select the IRI Voracity (SortCL) Job to run, which will produce the input data for Splunk.
Enter a unique name for the data input (without spaces). Set the interval and index location for the data input. 
The interval indicates how often the modular input will be run. The modular input involves invoking SortCL from the command line with a specified IRI Job location and any other specified additional command line arguments. The index selector specifies what index the data will be stored in. The IRI Job Location field must be filled with the full path to the IRI job (.*cl file). 
Additionally, seven different command line arguments can be added to the Modular Input to be run. These commands include /STATISTICS=, /WARNINGSON, /WARNINGSOFF, /DEBUG, /RC, /MONITOR=, and /OUTFILE=. Background on the SortCL program and its syntax can be found in the CoSort overview booklet. 
An extra file path must be specified if a command ends in '='. This field should be left blank if no command is selected or a command that does not end in '=' is selected. 
Finally, click the “add” button at the bottom of the dialog. The name of your new input (*.scl job script file) should now be listed in the data inputs table. 
Searching the Results
To search the results now available in Splunk, select “Search” from the navbar of the IRI App. Type “Source= “name_of_modular_input_type://modular_input_name”” to search the data indexed by the modular input. 
This can also be accessed by clicking “Data Summary” and selecting the source from the “Sources” menu. Use Splunk commands such as |stats, |chart, and |timechart to help visualize your data. See this article for a prior example.
Visualization
Here is an example of U.S. president data from 1900 onward sorted in a simple CoSort SortCL job, and then indexed and visualized by Splunk:
Action
In addition to visual analytics, you can also use the Splunk Adaptive Response Framework or a Phantom Playbook to take action on production or log data prepared in Voracity across a wide range of industries and applications. Examples would be wrangling customer transactions for Splunk to flag for promotion and pricing decisions, and MQTT or Kafka fed sensor data aggregated (and anonymized) by Voracity for Splunk to use in diagnostic or preventive alerts.

Deployment
splunk install app snmpmod.spl -update 1 -auth admin:changeme
cd $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/snmpmod
mkdir local
vim local/inputs.conf

SNMP v3
If you are using SNMP version 3 , you have to obtain the PyCrypto package yourself:
As of Python 2.7.9, pip is included with the release.  Run
pip2 install pycrypto


Windows
Copy C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\Crypto to $SPLUNK_HOME\etc\apps\snmpmod\bin
Linux
Copy /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Crypto to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/snmpmod/bin

snmpif Stanza
[snmpif://hostname]
destination = hostname
snmp_version = 3
v3_securityName = username
v3_authKey = password
snmpinterval = 300
interfaces = 1,5,8,9
index = network
# The sourcetype can be whatever you want
sourcetype = snmpif

ipsla Stanza
[ipsla://hostname]
destination = hostname
snmp_version = 3
v3_securityName = username
v3_authKey = password
snmpinterval = 300
operations = 2,7
index = network
sourcetype = ipsla

Response Handlers
destination, host and /etc/hosts
Currently, all response handlers set the Splunk host to the value of destination.  If you don't have DNS (bad sysadmin!) add an entry to /etc/hosts.  I'd be very happy to take a pull request that will look at a host config option and override destination with that value.
SNMP Interface Search Query
I strongly recommend you create a search macro snmpif_traffic that uses streamstats to calculate the bits per second from the raw snmpif data. My macro is:
stats first(*) as * by _time host ifIndex
| streamstats window=2 global=false current=true range(if*Octets) as delta*, range(_time) as secs by host, ifIndex
| where secs>0
| eval bpsIn=coalesce(deltaHCIn, deltaIn)*8/secs
| eval bpsOut=coalesce(deltaHCOut, deltaOut)*8/secs
| eval mbpsIn=bpsIn/1000000 | eval mbpsOut=bpsOut/1000000

Then to call it and display the results as a graph:
index=snmpif host=foo ifIndex=17 | `snmpif_parse`
| timechart bins=500 avg(mbpsIn) as ""Mbps IN"", avg(mbpsOut) as ""Mbps OUT""

And calculate 95th percentile figures
index=snmpif host=foo ifIndex=17 | `snmpif_parse`
| stats perc95(mbpsIn) as ""IN"", perc95(mbpsOut) as ""OUT""

Summary Collection
The search term shown above is quite expensive.  I am running the query above and collecting the data into a new index.
[search index=network sourcetype=snmp_traffic | stats first(_time) as earliest] index=network sourcetype=""snmpif""
| stats first(*) as * by _time host ifIndex
| streamstats window=2 global=false current=true range(if*Octets) as delta*, range(_time) as secs by host, ifIndex
| where secs>0
| eval bpsIn=coalesce(deltaHCIn, deltaIn)*8/secs
| eval bpsOut=coalesce(deltaHCOut, deltaOut)*8/secs
| eval mbpsIn=bpsIn/1000000
| eval mbpsOut=bpsOut/1000000
| fields _time host ifIndex bpsIn bpsOut ifAdminStatus ifDescr ifMtu ifOperStatus ifPhysAddress ifSpecific ifSpeed ifType mbpsIn mbpsOut
| collect index=network sourcetype=snmp_traffic

There is a trick there of using the most recent snmp_traffic event to start the next round of collections.  I run this search every 30 minutes.

Access and modify Splunk settings on a remote server without having to connect through SSH or remote desktop to it. Especially valuable when you don't like adding an exception to your firewall for splunkd port to quickly change something. 


Access settings that are not exposed through the common SplunkWeb UI.


Example:
splunk show config web

This will list all the active settings inside web.conf
splunk cmd splunkd rest POST /servicesNS/nobody/system/configs/conf-web/settings minify_js=false

This command will disable JavaScript minification that would make some js debugging easier.


Display license information

Example:
splunk list licenses



Execute commands on remote Splunk servers

Example:
 Run a search
splunk search bob -uri https://remoteserver:8089 -auth admin:password

 Restart remote server
splunk _internal call /services/server/control/restart -method POST -uri https://remoteserver:8089 -auth admin:goodpassword



Browse remote server's file tree

Example:
 Browsing /var/log directory on a Unix box:
splunk search ""| rest /services/admin/file-explorer/%252Fvar%252Flog count=100 | sort -hasSubNodes, name | table name, hasSubNodes, fileSize, lastModifiedTime""



Restart only SplunkWeb without leaving the browser. Useful when developing apps with custom python scripts or endpoints.

Example:
splunk restartss



Package your app

Example:
splunk package app {name}

DTEX InTERCEPT is powered by our patent-pending elastic metadata collection, correlation and analytics engine that delivers a 24x7x365 continuous audit trail of your enterprise landscape to observe and record the actions and activities of data, machines, applications, and people (DMAP) in near-real-time, both on and off the corporate network to surface dynamic behavioral awareness indicators.

The Enterprise Telemetry layer of DMAP+ contains a combination of smart, lightweight forwarders and real-time correlation of telemetry from data, machines, applications and people. Activities are continuously streamed to the DTEX Analytics Server.  Monitoring of all activity group types such as session, process, file system, window, net-flow, webpage, network, device and other activities is configurable through granular endpoint filters as well as via the DTEX Analytics Server and can be segregated by configurable groups. PII information contained in the activity data can be optionally tokenized via DTEX’s patented anonymization technique.
Enterprise Telemetry image
The Behavioral Enrichment layer of DMAP+ is focused on statistical analysis, risk profiling and machine learning.  As activities arrive at the DTEX Analytics Server from lightweight forwarders they are decrypted, decompressed, flattened then enriched through multiple stages of analysis including activity annotation and correlation.  
The Predictive Analytics layer of DMAP+ concentrates on the aggregation of behavior scores from the Behavioral Enrichment layer and stacks alerts to provide actionable information regarding known and unknown threats.  Outputs from the DMAP+ Predictive Analytics layer can be easily integrated with 3rd party SIEM platforms and data lakes.

About PAVO Authentication App for Splunk
Overview
Most sourcetypes contain authentication events of some sort. This app provides Splunk dashboards, forms, and reports which can be used to explore your authentication events across your different sourcetypes.
To do this, the app relies on the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) for authentication events. This means that the app can report on any authentication data, as long as it has been on-boarded properly, and is available through the Authentication data model.
A note on Splunk Data Model Acceleration and Disk Space
This app requires data model acceleration, which will use additional disk space. If you are using the Splunk App for Enterprise Security, this is already enabled, and should have been factored into your retention policies. If not, you should review the documentation on data model acceleration, how it uses disk space, and how to plan for it.
A note on the Splunk Common Information Model
As mentioned above, the app uses the CIM for authentication events. The CIM allows you to take events from a number of sources or products, and report on them in one cohesive manner, using a common set of names for fields and event types.
Available Dashboards
Authentication Overview
Provides a starting point for exploring your authentication events. Most panels will drill-down to other pages in the application.
User Profile
A view based on a single user’s authentication activity.
Source Profile
Authentication events which appear to come from a single source.
Destination Profile
Authentication events where users are authenticating against the same destination.
App Profile
Panels which focus on events which all are from the same application (win:local, ssh, vpn, etc).
Action Profile
A view based in the action (success, failure, unknown) from the authentication event.
Default Authentication
Reports on default authentication occurring in the environment. See the Customization section of this document for more information about how this dashboard can be customized for your deployment.
Privileged Authentication
Reports on privileged authentication occurring in the environment. See the Customization section of this document for more information about how this dashboard can be customized for your deployment.
Authentication Search (Advanced)
A form for finding events based on various field values.
Authentication Geography (Advanced)
Where in the World are authentications originating? View that here.
Sourcetypes (Advanced)
Information about the sourcetypes which are present in the accelerated data.

Prerequisites
Because this App runs on Splunk Enterprise, all of the Splunk Enterprise system requirements apply.
This app depends on data models included in the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on, specifically the Authentication data model. Please review the information on installing and using the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on and information on configuring the acceleration on the data model.
The Splunk Common Information Model Add-on can be downloaded from Splunkbase.
This app has been tested with versions 4.8 of the CIM add-on.
In order to make the app respond and load quickly, accelerated data models are used to provide summary data. For this data to be available, the Authentication data model must be accelerated. Information on how to enable acceleration for the Authentication data model can be found here. The data model must be accelerated for the length of time for which you would like to see reporting.
The Breakdown of Sourcetypes in Indexes in Dataset panel on the Data Transparency Overview dashboard will only be seen if the Sankey Diagram visualization is installed.
The Sankey Diagram Visualization can be downloaded from Sankey Diagram Custom Visualization.
Lookups
PAVO Authentication App for Splunk contains the following default lookup files.


apl_aut_default_users.csv


apl_aut_priv_users.csv


We strongly suggest that if you want to use customized versions of the lookups, you create new configurations for additional lookups, rather than editing the .csv files included in the app. Splunk lookup files are not upgrade safe, so future versions of the app may contain lookup files which may overwrite your customizations.
Macros
There are two macros which may be customized to help this app fit into your environment, and make use of other lookups (possibly the ones from the Splunk App for Enterprise Security). In both of these cases, the result is that the search in the macro should output a user field which contains the users appropriate for your environment.
Used for the Default Authentication dashboard. By default, uses the apl_aut_default_users.csv file. This list was put together from multiple sources, and may not contain all of the default users which may be available in your environment.
Used for the Privileged Authentication dashboard. By default, uses the apl_aut_priv_users.csv file. This list was put together from multiple sources, and may not contain all of the privileged users which may be available in your environment.

About
The Jira Issues Collector Client hosts the Javascript code and html button for a Jira Issue Collector popup UI in a Splunk Enterprise dashboard.
Usage
The Jira Issues Collector Client dashboard provides a host for the Javascript code and html button for a Jira Issue Collector popup user interface (UI). A KVStore collection is used to store the configuration (i.e. the button title, button label, and url to Jira Issue Collector javascipt code for the popup UI).
Configuration needed after initial installation
The app's configuration is stored in the jira_icc_collection_lookup KVStore collection, and no configuration is included with the initial app installation.

Create configuration<
The app's configuration is stored in the jira_icc_collection_lookup KVStore collection. To create a configuration, execute the following search with appropiate vaules:
| makeresults | eval Timestamp = now(), 
ic_title=""Click button to open Jira Isssue Collector Client"", 
ic_label=""Create Request"", 
ic_url=""https://your.atlassian.host.url/path.to.jira.javascript""
| outputlookup jira_icc_collection_lookup append=t

Read configuration
To read/view the configuration, execute the following search:
| inputlookup jira_icc_collection_lookup

Update configuration
To update the configuration, execute the following search with appropiate vaules:
| inputlookup append=t jira_icc_collection_lookup
| eval Timestamp = now(), 
ic_title=""Click button to open Jira Isssue Collector Client"", 
ic_label=""Create Request"", 
ic_url=""https://your.atlassian.host.url/path.to.jira.javascript""
| outputlookup jira_icc_collection_lookup append=t

Delete configuration
To delete the configuration, execute the following search:
| outputlookup jira_icc_collection_lookup</code></pre>

After configuration completed
After the configuration is completed, use the Jira Issue Collector by clicking on the ""Jira Issues Collector Client"" dashboard link. Then, click button on dashboard to open Jira Issues Collector UI.

Jira Issues Collector UI
Enter data into the Jira Issues Collector UI and click Submit button.

Security

Like any app, the level of security has a dependence on the environment used to host the app. So, it is suggested that the dependenices be updated periodically with their respective security patches/fixes.
Jira Issue Collector popup UI is created by the Jira Issue Collector Javascript code; so refer to the Jira documentation for info about data input validation for the popup UI.
No data input validation is done for the app's configuration; so it is recommended that write access to the jira_icc_collection_lookup KVStore collection be limited to Splunk admins.
If you have suggestions to improve the security of the app, please contact support.

Dependencies

The Jira Issues Collector Client app was developed on a Linux OS VM (CentOS) with a Splunk Dev environment. Due to limited resources, no development/testing at all was done against the Splunk Windows OS environment, but it is expected to work with Windows OS.
The Jira Issue Collector Javascipt code requires JQuery which is included with a Splunk Enterprise installation.
The Chrome web browser was used to develop the Jira Issues Collector Client. No testing/development was done with other web browsers.

Limitations and/or Known Issues

Only 1 Jira Issues Collector can be configured at this time; so only the first record that is returned by a search of the KVStore configuration is rendered on the dashboard.
This app only supports the Jira Issue Collector on the included dashboard. However in the future, it may be that a custom Splunk Enterprise visualization object could be developed to allow a Jira Issue Collector be added to any dashboard.

Installation Instructions

Download the app and unzip to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps on your Search Head
Restart Splunk
Generate a search that has a 'source', 'target' and optionally a count. 

Basic Search Examples



- index=firewall action=allowed
stats count by src_ip, dest_ip




Extended Search Examples
Optional Fields

line_label - To specify the line label of an edge
index=firewall action=allowed | stats count by src_ip, dest_ip, dest_port | rename dest_port as line_label
Will make the destination port the line label
line_color - To specify a color of an edge
index=firewall action=allowed | stats count by src_ip, dest_ip | eval line_color=if(count>10,""red"",""green""
If count is greater than 10 make the line red else make it green.
remove - For huge graphs, it is often faster to remove all nodes off of the graph and start with only one node on the graph.  All nodes that have any children can be expanded from here.
index=firewall action=allowed | stats count by src_ip, dest_ip | eval remove=""192.168.1.1
Remove all nodes from the graph except 192.168.1.1, if 192.168.1.1 is clicked the children will be re-added to the graph
preFilter - Allows you to prefilter your graph and remove all nodes that are connected to the node specified in the field.
Delete all nodes from the graph that are not children of 192.168.1.1

Configuration Options
Format Menu - Vizualization Style
Layout Style
Layout styles allow you to change the format of the graph.  Not every format is useful for every data type.  Test with all of the layouts.  Some are also faster than others (Grid is the fastest)
  - FCose (Default)
  - Grid
  - Circle
  - Klay
  - Dagre
  - Concentric
  - Breadthfirst
  - Spread
  - Cose
Path Selection Algorithm
This app allows you to build paths between nodes.  The path algorithm is customisable to give you different outcomes.
  - Dijikstra (Default)
  - aStar
  - floydWarshall
  - bellmanFord
Path Selection Directed
When performing path highlighting, you can honor the direction of the path by selecting true. So in the following scenario if you wanted to map a path from A through to C in the following  A:B B:C setting this setting to False would allow the path to be created.
  - True
  - False (Default)
Node Selection Options
If you click and hold on a node, a context relevant menu will pop-up with the following options.
- Hlt All Paths (Highlight All Paths)
This option allows you to highlight all paths from the node recursively honoring the direction set in the format menu.  It will add a highlighted class to the nodes selected
- Single Path Select
This option allows you to draw a single path using the Algorithm in the format menu and honoring the direction set.  To use this option, press and hold on the starting node and select Single Path Select then click and hold the target node and select Single Path Select.  If a path can be found the nodes will be highlighted.
- Condense
The condense option will condense the immediate children around the selected node in a concentric layout
- Focus
Same as condense.  But with a reset button.
Core Selection Options
If you click and hold in blank space on the node, a context relevant menu will pop-up with the following options.
- Menu 
Brings up an additional menu with the following options
    - Clear Formatting - Removes the highlighted class from all nodes
    - Delete Highlighted Items - Remove all highlighted items
    - Delete Non Highlighted Items - Remove all non highlighted items
    - Refresh - Refreshes the layout, useful when you have removed nodes and want the layout to be recomputed.
    - Save State - Allows you to save the state of the graph.  Please read save state below.
    - Search Edges - Allows you to enter a single term and a color to modify the style of the edge with that value
- Search Nodes - Allows you to find a node on the graph and zoom into the node.
Save State
An option exists in the framework to allow you to save the state of the graph.  This becomes really useful when you want to share your view with another analyst.  Before doing this you need to have the following.
- HTTP Event Collector Configured with an index of cyto
- A valid certificate for your HTTP Event Collector
- CORS Configured to allow requests
This call is performed via javascript so requires something similar to the following setup.

Note: In order to use alert actions functionality, Please ensure you are running the latest version of the Report Viewer and have the Puppet Alert Actions add-on installed as well.
Description
This is a Splunk App that provides views into the status of the Puppet installation that is sending its reports to Splunk via the HEC. To use this viewer it has to be installed alongside the splunk_hec report processor provided in the Puppet Forge. The report processor sends data from Puppet to Splunk via the HTTP Event Collector.
The steps to get this app working are:

Install the Puppet Report Viewer app
Create atleast one HEC input (puppet:summary)
Install splunk_hec module in Puppet environment and configure with the HEC token and Splunk Server

Once configured, the overview page will start showing Puppet run report status, and information about changes over various windows of time. The views can be customized, updated, modified to suit your needs.

For detailed report generation, a feature for Puppet Enterprise Users, there are additional steps one can perform that first require configuring the app with the appropriate credentials to talk to PuppetDB and to submit events to Splunk:

Create puppet:detailed HEC input
Create a Splunk user and role in the Puppet Enterprise console, with the permission to ""View node data from PuppetDB"" under the Nodes Type
Configure Puppet Enterprise to support long life authentication tokens
Generate an authentication token (example command) : curl -k -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 
 -d '{""login"": ""splunk"", ""password"": ""password"", ""lifetime"": ""1y""}' https://localhost:4433/rbac-api/v1/auth/token
On the configuration page of the Puppet Alert Actions add-on provide the hostname of the PuppetDB server & auth token, along with the hostname of the Splunk instace running the HEC along with the puppet:detailed HEC token (this is important to use the puppet:detailed token and sourcetype, otherwise it is possible to create an alert action that continually calls itself)
With the Alert Actions add-on configured, perform a search for a specific event (such as a puppet run with a failed or changed status) sourcetype=""puppet:summary""| spath status | search status=failed save it as an alert, and assign the action ""Generate detailed report"" from the action menu. No configuration of the action is needed.



Advanced Configuration
All report views support using custom indexes for storing event data. They accomplish this with a series of advanced search macros. The queries assume each sourcetype can be stored in it's own index (facts, summary reports, detailed reports, bolt events, action events, Puppet Enterprise metrics).
There is one top level macro, puppet_index which defaults to """", if you configure the HEC to use a different index and want all Puppet in that index, change that value here to be index=puppetindexname.
If you are using puppetlabs/splunk_hec version 0.5.0 or later, you can specify different HEC tokens for Summary Reports, Facts, and Metrics. Then create an index and an associated HEC token associated with those sourcetypes, and configure both the splunk_hec module in Puppet with those new values. Actions, Bolt Events, and Detailed Reports are all submitted via different tools and would need ot be changed according to use a different HEC token. Then the corresponding macro's updated to use those indexes.
For example, if you want most Puppet data to go to one index, but Facts, Metrics, and Detailed Reports to go to their own indexes, one would follow these steps:
- Create four indexes: puppet_data, puppet_facts_data, puppet_metrics_data, and puppet_detailed_data (or whatever name makes sense), each with their desired timespan, retention, etc.
- Create four HEC's (example names):
1. puppet with sourcetype of puppet:summary and the index puppet_data
2. puppet_facts with sourcetype of puppet:facts and the index of puppet_facts_data
3. puppet_metrics with sourcetype of puppet:metrics and the index of puppet_metrics_data
4. puppet_detailed with sourcetype of puppet:detailed and the index of puppet_detailed_data
- Configure the splunk_hec module with the corresponding tokens
1. splunk_hec::token with the value from the puppet HEC (since you want all Puppet using splunk_hec plugin to go here, except for facts and metrics)
2. splunk_hec::token_facts with the value from the puppet_facts HEC
3. splunk_hec::token_metrics with the value from the puppet_metrics HEC
- Update the Puppet Report Viewer's configuration to use the puppet_detailed HEC token, because detailed reports are pulled from Puppet and generated by the alert action in this application
- Update the advanced search macros to use the new values:
1. Open Advanced Search under the Settings -> Knowledge menu
2. Select Search Macros
3. Select puppet_index and change the definition to index=puppet_data, click save
4. Select puppet_facts_index and change the definition to index=puppet_facts_data, click save
5. Select puppet_metrics_index and change the definition to index=puppet_metrics_data, click save
6. Select puppet_detailed_index and change the definition to index=puppet_detailed_data, click save
- Reload the main view of the Puppet Report Viewer app, and you should see data, or perform the following search:
`puppet_all_index` sourcetype=puppet:*

Outcold Solutions provide solutions for monitoring Kubernetes, OpenShift and Docker clusters in Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud. We offer Splunk applications, which give you insights across all containers environments. We are helping businesses to reduce complexity related to logging and monitoring by providing easy-to-use and deploy solutions for Linux and Windows containers. We deliver applications to help developers monitor their applications and operators to keep their clusters healthy. With the power of Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud, we offer a unique solution to help you keep all the metrics and logs in one place, allowing you to quickly address complex questions on container performance and cluster health. 
Description
We provide solutions for monitoring Kubernetes, OpenShift and Docker clusters in Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud. With 10 minutes setup, you will get a monitoring solution, that includes log aggregation, performance and system metrics, metrics from the control plane and application metrics, a dashboard for reviewing network activity, and alerts to notify you about cluster or application performance issues.
All our solutions are powered by the Collectord, a container-native software built by Outcold Solutions that provides capabilities for discovering, transforming and forwarding logs, collecting system metrics, collecting metrics from the control plane of the orchestration frameworks and forwarding network activity. Collectord provides flexible and powerful tools for transforming logs. With our software you can hide sensitive information from the loglines before forwarding them. With Collectord you can reduce the licensing costs associated with logging aggregation by choosing which data you want to forward from the log streams. Collectord forwards container logs, host logs and can discover logs written by the containerized applications.
Use cases
Application Monitoring
See detailed metrics from containers and processes, including performance metrics, utilization metrics and security insights. Forward application-specific metrics, exported in Prometheus format. Use prebuilt Splunk dashboards for a comprehensive overview.
Log Aggregation
Aggregate logs from containers, applications, and servers. Use flexible mappings to filter logs enriched with container metadata, correlate logs with metrics, and leverage Splunk capabilities for analyzing logs. Use Collectord to transform logs before they reach Splunk, remove sensitive information, remove PII data to help keep your logs GDPR compliant. With Collectord you can reduce licensing and storage costs by choosing which loglines you want to forward.
Cluster Health Monitoring
Diagnose cluster issues by looking at historical events, monitoring allocations, and regulating cluster capacity. Leverage pre-built alerts for monitoring the health of the clusters out of the box.
Security and Audit
Define access to the data by clusters, namespaces and even pods or containers. Review network activities, happening inside your cluster, and outside connections. Verify containers running with elevated security permissions. Use audit logs for monitoring changes in deployments.
Reduce complexity and improve productivity
Use one tool to collect and forward logs and metrics required by developers for reviewing performance and health of their applications. With the annotations developers can define how they want to see the data in log aggregation tool, specify multiline log patterns, removing terminal escape codes, override types, sources and indexes.

Navigate to CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence Add-on, click on ""Configuration"" and add ""Account"" with authorized credentials.
Click on ""Input"" and fill the ""Account"", ""Interval"" and ""Starting Date"" fields, using which REST API Calls will be called.
In case needed index name can also be updated here to drive data into specific index name.
Splunk Indexerâ€™s IP address needs to be given in outputs.conf to send data to specific Splunk Indexer.
Restart the instance once and that should start pushing data onto the Splunk Indexer.



On Splunk Indexer Nodes:

On Splunk Indexer, No TA configurations are needed. In case of custom Index, the custom Index should be created.



On Splunk Search Head:

On Splunk Search head, Install TA but configurations are not needed.



** Note: By default, all data is indexed to the main index. If you want to use a custom index then kindly update ""cs_get_intelligence_index"" macro in CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence Add-on.
TROUBLESHOOTING
A good test to see that you are receiving all of the data we expect is to run below search after several minutes:

Execute below search in case TA-crowdstrike_falcon_intel Addon has been installed and configured.
    search cs_get_intelligence_index | stats count by sourcetype

In particular, you should see below sourcetype:
* crowdstrike:falcon:intelligence

To troubleshoot Crowdstrike Intel Addon, check $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/ta_crowdstrike_falcon_intel_falcon_intelligence_data_input.log file.

The Stamus Networks App for Splunk allows Splunk Enterprise users to extract information and insights from both the Stamus NDR and open source Suricata sensors. It provides dashboards and reports but also a set of commands to interact with Stamus NDR via its REST API.
Sources of the App are available on Github.
Initial Setup
Some visualizations depend on Timeline App and URL Toolbox that will have to be installed if not present on your Splunk® instance.
Stamus Network Detection and Response users need to setup the connectivity with their Stamus Security Platform (SSP). To do so, you need to create a file local/ssp.conf under the application directory (/opt/splunk/etc/apps/stamus_for_splunk usually) and setup the following:
[config]
api_key = SSP_TOKEN
base_url = https://SSP_ADDRESS
check_tls = no
The SSP_TOKEN can be generated from Stamus Security Platform by going to Account Settings via the user icon on the top right and selecting Edit token. Only read access is necessary so a user with low privilege can be used.

Using data from Host Identification module of SSP
Concept
Stamus NDR features a Host Identification module that builds identity cards of IP addresses seen
in the network without storing all raw events. This provides a concise view of the major attributes that can be linked to an IP address.
An host identification entry includes:

List of hostnames associated with the IP
List of usernames that connected to this IP
List of network services
List of HTTP user agents
List of TLS agents (using JA3 technology)
List of SSH agents

All this information is associated with a first-seen and last-seen timestamp, so it is possible to know
precisely when a username or a HTTP user agent was first seen on a given IP address.
Host ID search
To get software version of all HTTP server in a network (here internet):
| snhostsearch filter=""services.values.app_proto=http net_info.agg=internet""| spath ""services{}.values{}.http.server"" | top ""services{}.values{}.http.server""
To get all hosts that are not running a version curl:
| snhostsearch filter=""http_user_agent.agent!=curl*"" | spath http_user_agent{}.agent output=agent | spath ip | top ip, agent
Host ID filter
The snhostfilter commands allow you to select only events where src_ip or dest_ip is in the host ID set defined by the filter.
The following search returns all alerts for hosts running a service on port 443.
event_type=""alert"" | snhostfilter filter=""services.port=443""
Host ID lookup
The snhostlookup lookup resolves ip to hostname (and reverse) using the hostname information collected by SSP.
The following search returns all alert events and resolve destination ip to hostname.
event_type=""alert""| lookup snhostlookup ip as dest_ip| stats count by hostname
Using data from Stamus Threat events
Concept
The threat radar inside Stamus NDR generates events with type stamus that are high fidelity events generated from signatures or custom algorithms. These events are also mapped to the cyber kill chain to identify the phase of the attack.
Thread ID lookup
Get threat by network and use snthreatfilter to do threat_id resolution:
event_type=""stamus"" | eval Network = if('stamus.asset_net_info' == """", ""Unknown"", 'stamus.asset_net_info') | snthreatfilter | stats dc(stamus.asset) as Assets by Network, threat_name
You can also lookup the Threat Family information via the snthreatfamilylookup:
event_type=""stamus"" | lookup snthreatfamilylookup family_id as stamus.family_id | top family_name",Version 0.9.16,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/a232dafc-326f-11ec-90fa-1a9d772ae210.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html,852,0,splunk,5,3,Stamus Networks,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/stamus_networks,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

Getting started
This app is not ""visible"" in the Splunk UI app menu. After installing the app, follow this process:
1. Do a search of any data and switch to the visualisation tab
2. In the top left, in the visualisastion menu, select ""Circlepack viz""
3. Open the ""Format"" menu then select ""Help""
4. There will be a link to the in-app documentation, which includes working examples

Usage
This visualisation expects tabular data, with any amount of text/category columns, but the last column must be a numerical value. 
For example, the following data:



field1
field2
field3
numeric_value




outer1
mid1
node1
5


outer1
mid1
node2
4


outer1
mid2
node3
9


outer2
mid3
node4
13



Would produce this:

The typical search uses stats command like so:
index=* | stats count BY index sourcetype source
Sidenote: a much faster search to do the same thing is 
|tstats count where index=* BY index sourcetype source
Note that stats does not return rows when the group BY field is null. Convert nulls to be an empty string like this:
index=_internal 
| eval component = coalesce(component,"""") 
| eval log_level = coalesce(log_level,"""") 
| stats count BY sourcetype component log_level
Add more fields after the ""BY"" keyword to increase the depth

Formatting options

The ""Color overrides"" field accepts either a JSON object (in curly braces) or comma separated pairs. For example to make sure that ""INFO"" values are green, WARN's are orange and ERROR's are red, set the value like so: 
INFO,#1a9035,ERROR,#b22b32,WARN,#AF5300
The ""Set color by"" options ""First field.."" allow for data to set the color of the leaf node but not affect the grouping. The  ""First field as color codes (n/g)"" option allows for valid HTML color codes to be passed in from the search. Here is an example search:
index=_internal 
| stats sum(count) as count BY log_level component 
| eval color = case(log_level==""ERROR"", ""#b22b32"",log_level==""INFO"", ""#1a9035"",log_level==""WARN"", ""#AF5300"", true(), ""blue"") 
| table color component count
Note that when using ""Click action"" of ""Zoom in"" the labels are not clipped and will probably overlap.

uberAgent consists of two main components: the actual agent runs on the endpoints you want to be monitored, sending the data it collects to the configured backend either directly or via Splunk's Universal Forwarder. The second main component, implemented as a set of Splunk apps, provides dashboards, visualizations, searches, and reports.
The Agent
uberAgent's data collecting component is a lightweight agent that runs independently of any runtimes or frameworks. The agent's footprint is so small that it is truly unobtrusive on the monitored endpoints and does not affect user density.
Where other products rely on operating system sources such as performance counters, WMI, or similar unfiltered data, uberAgent comes with its own metrics. Instead of raw data uberAgent gives you information that matters (see uberAgent's list of metrics).
The agent is highly configurable: metrics can be turned on or off individually, the data collection frequency can be chosen freely, blacklists and whitelists (supporting regular expressions) allow for fine-grained control. This ensures that only data you really need is sent to the backend for indexing.
Browser Extensions
uberAgent's endpoint agent is complemented by browser extensions, which enable uberAgent to collect performance and usage metrics from web apps, too. Extensions are available for all major browsers.
The Splunk Apps
Multiple Splunk apps help process and visualize the data collected by the agent. The indexer app lives on Splunk indexers and mainly creates uberAgent's index and data input. Dashboard apps implement the user interface, providing different views into the collected data. uberAgent comes with two dashboard apps: one for uberAgent UXM and another for uberAgent ESA.
uberAgent's main apps are complemented by special-purpose apps that offer a different view of the existing uberAgent data, such as the uberAgent Helpdesk app.
Most dashboards are searchable and have extensive filtering capabilities to give you a fast and powerful way of isolating specific data. Time range pickers make it easy to go back to the exact time a problem occurred.
uberAgent makes full use of Splunk's advanced UI components to display a beautiful user interface that fluidly adapts to screen width and device type. As a result, it works equally well on a tablet as on a PC or Mac.

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3545,2022-01-10,07:56:18 AM,Add-On- Endpoint Standard VMware Carbon Black Cloud,,"Aug. 22, 2019","The Carbon Black Developer Network is proud to announce the second major public release of our Cb Defense Add-On for splunk.
This add-on is available for download now from Splunkbase and integrates
Splunk with your Cb Defense console, forwarding alerts from Cb Defense right into your Splunk instance.
This add-on is now compatible with both Splunk on-premise and Splunk cloud.
Requirements
This Add-On requires Cb Defense and Splunk version 6.6 or above.
No additional hardware requirements are necessary for running this Add-On above the standard requirements for both
Carbon Black and Splunk.
Getting Started
The App can be downloaded from Splunkbase, and then manually installed on a Splunk instance - or installed directly from within the Splunk UI by logging into Splunkbase and searching for the CB Defense Add-On for Splunk.
Once the Cb Defense Add-On for Splunk is installed, then you must configure it to connect to your Cb Defense server.
This is done by generating a ""SIEM"" connector key in the Cb Defense console. For information on how to generate API keys,
see the Cb Developer Network.
Ensure that your new Connector key is of type ""SIEM"".
Next, add ""notification"" rules to your Cb Defense server. Navigate to the ""Settings -> Notifications"" page and 
click the ""Add Notification"" button. Make sure to add the connector key name you set up above into the list of
subscribed connectors in the text box at the bottom of the notification rule dialog box.
If you are working from a Splunk instance with a UI you can use the web-UI to configure the Add-on quite simply.
See below for instructions on how to configure the Add-on from the CLI - for instance when deploying to a forwarder. 
To configure the Cb Defense Add-on for Splunk to connect to your Cb Defense server:
GUI Configuration

Start the Cb Defense Add-on in Splunk
Go to the ""Inputs"" tab - ""Create new input"" page and fill in the following fields:
Enter the API hostname for your Cb Defense instance in the url field. See information on which URL to use here.
Set apikey to your API key and the connector ID to your connector ID 
Set ""name"" to anything (for example ""cbdefense"")
Set ""interval"" to 60 seconds (the polling interval of the Cb Defense notifications API)
Set ""index"" to whatever Splunk index you'd like the Add-On to place Cb Defense events into



The 2.X Add-on for Splunk supports as many rest-inputs as a user desires. If you would like to integrate with multiple Cb Defense Servers/Connectors simply define multiple inputs.
The Cb Defense Add-On for Splunk uses Splunk’s encrypted credential storage facility to store the API token for your Cb Defense server, so the API key is stored securely on the Splunk server.
CLI Configuration
The Cb Defense Add-on for Splunk can also be configured through the CLI:
1) Manually install the Add-on, restart Splunk 
2) Create a $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-Cb_Defense/local/inputs.conf like this: 
```
[carbonblack_defense://<inputname>]
cb_defense_api_url = <ip or hostname of CB Defense> 
interval = <Interval to poll the notifications API at > 
siem_api_key = <API KEY> 
siem_connector_id = <connector ID>
```

Once again, you can define multiple stanzas in the inputs.conf to integrate with multiple Cb Defense Servers/Connectors.",Version 2.0.4,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/e19f169a-c4f5-11e9-a834-06f420eb5d7a.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,"3,067",0,splunk,3,4,Carbon Black Developer Network,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/carbonblack,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1559,2022-01-10,07:56:21 AM,Splunk App for Microsoft SharePoint,,"Nov. 22, 2014","This app is designed to provide dashboards for Microsoft SharePoint 2010 or SharePoint 2013 and a set of starting dashboards covering health, audit and usage. The data collection provided by the TA-Sharepoint (http://apps.splunk.com/app/1908) includes the following:

SharePoint Object Inventory
Service and Performance Information
Network Latency Information
IIS Logs
ULS Logs
SharePoint Audit Logs

This app will not work until all installation is completed. The installation process will take some time and some adjustment to the permissions structures that govern the SharePoint farm.
System Requirements
The ""central Splunk instance"" (consisting of search heads and indexers) can be any operating system. You must be running Splunk v6.2 or later on all Splunk servers within the central Splunk instance. 
Splunk App for Microsoft SharePoint supports:

Microsoft SharePoint 2010 running on Windows Server 2008R2
Microsoft SharePoint 2013 running on Windows Server 2012 and 2012R2

Installation
Step 1: Install the Splunk App for SQL Server on all Content Servers
The backend storage for SharePoint is SQL Server. If you wish, install the Splunk App for SQL Server, which is available on Splunkbase, prior to commencing work on SharePoint.  Note that there is a single panel in a single dashboard that utilizes the SQL Server data.
Step 2: Prepare the Splunk Indexers
Create the following indices in the Splunk Indexers:

perfmon
iis
mssharepoint

In addition, you must deploy the TA-Sharepoint app to the Indexers or Heavy Intermediate Forwarders.  This add-on can be found on Splunkbase at http://apps.splunk.com/app/1908  You will need to restart the splunkd process to register this app on each indexer. You can disable the inputs within this app as they are not necessary.
The TA-Sharepoint add-on handles augmented line breaking and data fixing of the ULS logs so that each transaction is available as a single event instead of multiple events. This is required for exception reporting within the dashboards.
Step 3: Designate an Inventory and Audit Reader
One of your SharePoint servers must be designated as an inventory and audit reader. This server will be used to gather the inventory information and to read the audit log within SharePoint. The Universal Forwarder that is installed on this SharePoint server will need special handling.
If you have multiple farms, then you must designate an Inventory and Audit Reader in each farm.
Step 4: Install Splunk on the other SharePoint servers
Each SharePoint server that is not the Inventory and Audit Reader host can get a standard ""Local System"" type install of the latest Splunk Universal Forwarder (version v6.2 or later). It should be linked to a Splunk Deployment Server so that you can easily push updated apps to the Universal Forwarder. It should be sending data to the central Splunk instance.
Step 5: Install Splunk on the Inventory and Audit Reader
The Splunk Universal Forwarder that is running on the Inventory and Audit Reader must be running as a domain account. The domain accounts must have the following characteristics:

Local Administrator
Add-SPShellAdmin (PowerShell Farm Administrator)

To add the database permissions properly, ensure you run the following command using machine administrator from a farm administrator account that has shell admin privileges to SharePoint_Config:
Get-SPDatabase | Add-SPShellAdmin -UserName 'DOMAIN\user'

Where DOMAIN\user is the username of the user running the Splunk Universal Forwarder.
If you have multiple farms, then the user involved is probably different for each farm. Each farm will need their own Inventory and Audit Reader.
Step 6: Deploy Add-ons to the SharePoint servers
The following add-ons need to be deployed to each server:

Splunk_TA_windows v4.64 or later
TA-Sharepoint v0.2.0 or later
SA-ModularInput-PowerShell v1.2.0 or later

Ensure you follow the instructions for enabling the Audit and Inventory inputs on the Audit and Inventory Reader
Step 7: Add cs-host to the SharePoint site logging
Normally, the full URL that the user types in is not available in the logs. You need to adjust the logging specification for each web site in IIS as follows:

Open up the IIS Manager
Select the SharePoint Site
Select Logging
Click on Select Fields
Check the box next to cs-host
Click on OK
Under Actions, click on Apply
Repeat steps 2-7 for each additional SharePoint site and host

This needs to be completed on each SharePoint host that answers IIS queries (which is generally all of them).
Step 8: Add Users to the SharePoint role
Part of the app install will also enable a sharepoint role. Add users that will view the SharePoint data to the sharepoint role. Without this step, they may not be able to see the relevant data. As an alternative to this process, you can also edit the eventtypes supplied with the app to indicate which index the data resides in.
Step 9: Wait 1 hour
We need some data from the inventory and this is gathered on a regular basis. In general, this data is collected within the first hour of operation.
Step 10: Regenerate Lookup Files
There is a dashboard under Searches and Reports -> Lookup Generators called the Lookup Table Builder.  Use it to generate all the lookup tables.
Step 11: Check Errors
Log into Splunk and open the Splunk App for SharePoint. Select Health -> Farm Errors. All errors in this report are significant.
Errors
If the modular inputs show errors, they will show up in the splunkd.log file. The most common will be something to the effect ""SPFarm.Local == null"", which would indicate a permissions problem. Specifically, the user that is being used to run the Splunk Universal Forwarder on the Audit and Inventory reader has not been added to the SPShellAdmin list with Add-SPShellAdmin.
If you get Farm Errors showing an SqlException 80131904, then it is likely that you have not provided access to all the databases. Log on to the Central Administration host as a farm administrator with shell admin rights on SharePoint_Config; bring up a PowerShell host using ""Run as Administrator"", and type the following:
Add-PsSnapIn Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell
Get-SPDatabase | Add-SPShellAdmin -UserName 'DOMAIN\user'

Replace the DOMAIN\user with the username of the user running the Splunk Universal Forwarder.
Performance Issues
The most normal performance issue is from the Inventory and Audit Reader.  I recommend running this on a separate host if performance is an issue.",Version 0.2.1,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/31fa5c8c-7215-11e4-b5a7-028f3d31a1c4.png,IT Operations,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,"2,524",0,splunk,3,8,Adrian Hall,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/cxadrian,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

This is a Add-on for Splunk to provide a custom search command called 'refresh'
to reload most of the Splunk config endpoints.
It does not reload admin/cooked and admin/auth-services be default.
Simply call | refresh in the search bar to reload the endpoints. Use | refresh entity=all to also reload the splunktcp cooked REST endpoint (can result in data loss!)
Or specify an entity to be reloaded | reload entity=foo
Installation

Install as any other Splunk App

Debug
If needed you can enabled debugging to splunkd.log in the script refresh.py by
setting myDebug='yes' on line 6
Support
This is an open source project, no support provided, but you can ask questions

About
The CLI Auto and CLI Auto Add-on apps provide a job engine (via a custom REST API endpoint) and an user interface to connect to several nodes (hosts) via ssh to execute and index (i.e. log to Splunk) the output of a Command Type (i.e. a set of CLI commands). Each Command Type configuration defines the set of CLI command(s), user input variables, data validation, success/failure regular expressions, and other configuration settings for the associated Command Type. Only a few Command Types were included in the initial version of the app; however, the app allows an user to develop and add more Command Types. With the wide support of CLI (ssh), the possible Command Types are numerous. It should be noted that the initial development of this app was geared toward user management CLI commands for Checkpoint, Palo Alto, and Sonicwall firewalls. The intent of this app is not to be a replacement for any management tools for these firewall brands or any other network device that supports CLI.
For CLI Auto versions 2.0.8 or greater, CLI Auto was split into 2 apps (i.e. the CLI Auto and CLI Auto Add-on apps) to add Splunk distributed/cluster environment features. So, it is required that both apps be installed for versions 2.0.8 or greater. Versions 2.0.8 or greater are not backwards compatible with versions 2.0.7 or older. For a single Splunk server environment, both the CLI Auto and CLI Auto Add-on apps are installed on the same server. For a distributed Splunk environment, it is recommended that the CLI Auto app is installed on a Search Head (SH) and/or a Deployer is used to deploy the CLI Auto app to the members of a Search Head cluster. In addition, the CLI Auto Add-on app is recommended to be installed on a Heavy Forwarder (HF) referred to as a Remote Addon Server in the CLI Auto app. As an example use case, the add features allow the CLI Auto Add-on app be installed on multiple HFs to run CLI commands on network nodes in multiple segmented networks which have the same subnets with the CLIAuto app being the common UI.
Dependencies


The CLI Auto and CLI Auto Add-on applications were developed on a Linux OS VM (CentOS) with a Splunk Dev environment. Due to limited resources, no development/testing at all was done against the Splunk Windows OS environment.


The Pexpect (pxssh) libraries (i.e. provide the ssh connection) were built for the CentOS hosting the Splunk dev environment and copied to the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/cliauto_addon/bin folder. The Openssh app (included with several Linux OS distros) is a dependency of the Pexpect (pxssh) libraries. And as of this writing, the ptyprocess libraries are a dependency for the Pexpect (pxssh) libraries; so the ptyprocess libraries were built for the OS hosting the Splunk dev environment and copied to the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/cliauto_addon/bin folder also. For most Linux OS Splunk installations, the /opt/splunk folder is the default value for the $SPLUNK_HOME environment variable.


The Splunk Python SDK libraries provide intergration to the Splunk environment for the job engine (reference the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/app_name/bin/splunklib and $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/app_name/bin/utils folders - app_name is cliauto and cliauto_addon).


The Bootstrap (JS and CSS files) and Splunk Javascript SDK libraries help to provide front-end (UI) components (reference the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/cliauto/appserver/static folder).


The CLI Auto app was developed using the Chrome web browser. No testing/development was done with other web browsers.


Usage
The CLI Auto dashboard provides an user interface (UI) to start and monitor submitted jobs. To get the help notes for the UI, hover your cursor over the input fields and job record table headers to display the associated tooltip. Enter a Script User, enter a Script Password, select a Node List KVStore CSV Lookup file (see the instructions below to create the Node List file), and select a Command Type.

Select the Addon Server that will execute your job. For a single server environment, select the local Addon server. The Config dashboard can be used to configure a remote Addon Server(s) for the CLI Auto app. A remote Addon server is a Splunk Heavy Forwarder with the CLI Auto Add-on app installed. This input is available for CLI Auto app versions 2.0.8 or greater.

Script Username
Enter the username that has permissions to login via to all of the nodes in the Node List. The tooltips are defined in the cliauto.conf (CLI Auto app) and cliauto_cmds.conf (CLI Auto Add-on app) files.

Script Password
Enter the password for the Script username.

Command Type
Select the CLI command(s) to be executed in the Command Type field. (example: SWFW Show Version)

Node List
The KVStore Lookup CSV file needs to contain a header record with 2 columns named host and ip_address. Please see the example in the screenshot below.

To create the KVStore Lookup CSV file within Splunk, click Settings->Lookups.

Click Add New for Lookup table files.

Select cliauto for the Destination app, click the Choose File button to select your Node List CSV file, give the Destination file an appropiate name, and click Save.

Verify that the KVStore Lookup table file was successfully saved.


Note: Splunk has other ways to create a KVStore Lookup file (a search command, other apps, etc.)
In the dashboard, select the KVStore CSV Lookup file that contains the nodes for the Command Type.
Submit Button
Click the Submit button to process the job.

Submit Confirm
Please type yes to confirm and submit job.

Permissions
If you receive a popup similar to the ones below, your username may not have the proper permissions. Please see the Security section below with info to request your Splunk administrator for the proper access to the app.


Wait for the job to complete (and be searchable within Splunk)
The Status at the top of the dashboard and the status column of the job history table displays status info about the job. The Status at the top of the dashboard is the overall status of the job which includes the Addon server completing the job and the job events being searchable within Splunk. The status column of the job history table is the status of the Addon server completing the job.

Job Results
To view the results for a job, click All, Success, or Fail to open the Splunk search app and execute the search with the filters provided in the respective url link. You can also find the job's results that were indexed to Splunk by creating you own search string (SPL) in the Splunk Search app with the index, source, sourcetype, and Job Id as filters. For example in the screenshot, index=main source=cliauto sourcetype=cliauto_ssh jobid=5bce1418e1382395b6480856. The default index, source and sourcetype for the app are index=main, source=cliauto and sourcetype=cliauto_ssh; so if you changed them in the CLI Auto app's conf file $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/cliauto/default/cliauto.conf, your SPL search string will need to reflect your changes.

The ""result"" field
The ""result"" field in the job results is controlled by the success and failure regular expressions for the associated Command Type. The primary purpose of the ""result"" field is to provide a method to sort the job results to allow for an user to more quickly identify any possible next actions.

Dependencies install instructions (as needed)
For ssh support, you need the ptyprocess and Pexpect (pxssh) python modules for this app, and are included in the installation files. However if needed, they can be downloaded from here and here.
Due to the limited module set installed with Splunk's Python instance, you may need to build these modules with a second installation of Python. Once you've built the modules you will need to copy the build/lib/ptyprocess and the build/lib/pexpect directories into your $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/cliauto_addon/bin directory. Also, the Splunk Python SDK libraries need to exist in the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/cliauto_addon/bin directory.
Follow build instructions on the respective sites.  No need to install. Instructions should be the same
for both modules:
    cd $BUILD/pexpect-4.6.0
    python setup.py build
    cd $BUILD/ptyprocess-0.6.0
    python setup.py build

Copy the respective directories to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/cliauto_addon/bin 
    cp -Rf $BUILD/pexpect-4.6.0/build/lib/pexpect $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/cliauto_addon/bin
    cp -Rf $BUILD/ptyprocess-0.6.0/build/lib/ptyprocess $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/cliauto_addon/bin

Restart splunk.
Application Data Flow, Main Execution Path, and Threads
The 5 diagrams below show the data flow, main execution path, and threads for the applications.





Security


The CLI Auto app is secured with the cliauto_custom_endpoint capability and the cliauto_user role. It should be noted that the list_storage_passwords capability is included in the cliauto_user role to allow the app to read the password for the configured username/password credentials of a remote addon server. It is suggested in the interest of ""least privilege"" that the list_storage_passwords capability be disabled for the cliauto_user role if not needed. Contact your Splunk administrator to grant your Splunk user account the cliauto_user role to gain the required capabilities for the app.


Like any app, the level of security has a dependence on the environment used to host the app. So, it is suggested that the dependenices (see above) be updated periodically with their respective security patches/fixes.


For security reasons, it is recommended that the Custom (cli_custom) cmdtype be disabled in the cliauto_cmds.conf file unless needed for your use cases and proper security controls are in place. The intent of the Custom (cli_custom) cmdtype is to provide Splunk administrators/power users a tool to develop their own cmdtypes.


The data input validation for the app is to help guard against malicious and/or unintended uses. If your use case(s) requires data input that is blocked by the data input validation, the conf files may have a setting that can be modified to allow it. If not, you are welcome to suggest a new feature.


Some security related options of the ssh client (pexpect/pxssh library) are included in the cliauto.conf file, and should be reviewed/set for your environment/use cases. If more options are needed for your use case, a feature request is suggested.


It should be noted that the login function of the pexpect (pxssh) library was overridden for the app to account for specific use cases.


If you have suggestions to improve the security of the app, please contact support.


Application Performance
Using a Splunk VM on a laptop, the app has successfully executed several jobs with 300+ unique hosts and MaxThreads setting = 75 for multiple Command Types. A job with 1000 hosts (with non-active ip_addresses) was tested successfully also. Please let me know your feedback on the performance of the application.
Command Types
It should be noted that the app allows for additional Command Types to be configured by Splunk Administrators/Power Users. The configuration of each included Command Type (cmdtype) can be found in the cliauto_cmds.conf file in the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/cliauto_addon/default folder. Each cmdtype configuration defines the CLI command(s), user input variables, data validation, success/failure regular expressions, and other configuration settings for the associated cmdtype. Per the ""configuration file precedence"" design feature of Splunk, it is recommended that new cmdtypes (or changes) be done by creating a $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/cliauto_addon/local folder and conf file with the same filename (cliauto_cmds.conf). The contents of the new conf file must contain the stanza (aka cmdtype) along with the configuration setting. Also, please reference the cliauto_cmds.conf.spec file in the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/cliauto_addon/README folder for a description of the configuration settings.
Limitations and/or Known Issues

The app's custom REST API endpoint (job engine) uses the user's session credentials for access to the Splunk environment. These session credentials expire based on the Splunk Session timeout setting (see Settings->Server settings->General settings->Session timeout in Splunk UI) which has a default setting of 1 hour. If a job's exectution time is longer than the Session timeout setting, the job may fail due to losing access to the Splunk environment. It is not expected that any properly configured job would last longer than the default setting of 1 hour, but please be aware of this limitation of Splunk and/or the app.
This issue only impacts the inspection/certification (i.e. ""Splunk AppInspect Passed"" badge on splunkbase website) of the ""CLI Auto for Splunk"" app by the online Splunk AppInspect app, but not the functionality of the ""CLI Auto for Splunk"" or ""CLI Auto Add-on for Splunk"" apps. As of this writing, the online Splunk AppInspect app contains a issue that fails an app which does not have a python.version=python3 key/value pair for ALL stanzas in the restmap.conf file even if the python.version key is not defined for the stanza. The workaround was to add the python.version=python3 key/value pair to ALL stanzas in the restmap.conf file, and add the python.version key in a restmap.conf.spec file to prevent ""Invalid key"" messages from the btool app.

1) A system running Puppet's facter
2) Universal Forwarder or Splunk enteprise must be running as a user that has rights to run facter and all it's facts
3) Linux only, tested on CentOS5/6
4) Facter should be in your path, if not you can hard code the path in the facter.sh script
Installation
1) Expand app into /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/apps or push via the deployment server
2) Restart Splunk
Notes
1) Consider changing the run interval 
2) Go in and add your own log management via your log rotation facility and delete the script that does it from the app
3) Change the index from main. Main is bad. This should probably be in index=puppet or index=os. I left it main, so the app would work out of the box. 
4) The results of this script are a CIM as as your facter facts are. I highly recommend working with your Puppet team to ensure the actual facts are CIM compliant. If you can't get the Puppet admins to make changes look at facter.sh for some script examples of how to CIM your facts. 
https://docs.puppetlabs.com/facter/2.2/custom_facts.html

1) Add more CIM examples, so CIMing the log can be more useful to those who don't want to script this

Click on ""Create New Access Key"", then you will see popup window which contains keys and there is an option to download keys.
The above keys need to be configured in APP -> Configuration -> Add-on Settings.

File Name: Splunk Search results are created with value you enter for File Name field ( Note: do not add extenstion like csv,json, extention will be added from TA based on File Format you choose). For example if you enter File Name: test and you chose csv in file format option then test_epochtimestamp.csv will be created in S3. The reason for adding timestamp to the file name is because you might be adding this alert action to report/alert and if file name is unique then same file in s3 will be updating.

Add-on Homepage: https://apps.splunk.com/apps/id/TA-carbonblack_edr
Author: Hurricane Labs
Version: 1.0.0

Description
The purpose of this add-on is to provide value to your Carbon Black EDR S3 buckets. This is done by making the logs CIM compliant, adding tagging for Enterprise Security data models, and other knowledge objects to make searching and visualizing this data easy.
This add-on requires the AWS TA for data ingestion (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876/) to pull the S3 bucket. The add-on you are downloading now is only for knowledge objects!


Supported Data Types:

endpoint.event.procstart (cb:edr:endpoint)
Process launch event.


endpoint.event.procend (cb:edr:endpoint)
Process terminate event.


endpoint.event.apicall (cb:edr:endpoint)
Similiar to crossproc events that are generated by Behavioral EDR.


endpoint.event.netconn (cb:edr:endpoint)
Network connection event.


endpoint.event.filemod (cb:edr:endpoint)
File modification event.


endpoint.event.regmod (cb:edr:endpoint)
Registry modification event.


endpoint.event.moduleload (cb:edr:endpoint)
A “module load” is generated every time a process loads a shared library (DLL in
Windows, .so in Linux, .dylib in macOS) into its process memory space.


endpoint.event.crossproc (cb:edr:endpoint)
Any time a process interacts with another process on the system, that is considered a
“cross-process” event.


CbAnalytics (cb:edr:analytics)
CB Analytic alerts are created from the Endpoint Standard NGAV offering.


Watchlist (cb:edr:watchlist)
Watchlist alerts are created from alert enabled watchlists in Enterprise EDR





Built for Splunk Enterprise 6.x.x or higher

CIM Compliant (CIM 4.0.0 or higher)
Ready for Enterprise Security

Constraints

This add-on requires that you use the sourcetype ""cb:edr:s3"" when ingesting the data via the AWS TA.
This add-on must be installed alongside the AWS TA (HF, typically) and Search Head(s).
The add-on must be installed and Splunk restarted before you setup the inputs.

SPLUNK INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
* Search Head: Add-on Always Required (Knowledge Objects)
* Heavy Forwarder: Add-on Possibly Required (Event Parsing)
* Indexer: Possibly Add-on Required (Event Parsing)
* SH & Indexer Clustering: Supported

CB EDR Add-on Installation Instructions

This add-on needs to be installed on your Search Head(s) and on the Splunk Enterprise instance that is running the AWS TA inputs.
Once installed, restart Splunk (restart not needed on SH, only HF).

CB EDR S3 Setup

Follow the steps as outlined by Carbon Black here:
https://developer.carbonblack.com/guide/enterprise-response/event-forwarder-s3-bucket-configuration/



Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services Setup

Note: If you perform these steps without first installing the CB EDR Add-on and restarting Splunk, this will not work as expected!
If you are installing this add-on fresh, typically you want to put it on a Heavy Forwarder.
Download is available here: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876/


In the app drop down, click the 'Splunk Add-on for AWS'.
Click 'Configuration'
Click 'add' and put in your AWS access/secret key.
(Optional) click 'IAM Role' and create one, if necessary for your environment.


Click 'Inputs' and 'Create New Input' > Custom Data Type > Generic S3
(Optional) For increased performance, you should strongly consider setting up SQS-based S3 queue instead rather than Generic S3.
Documentation Links:
Generic S3: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/AWS/S3
SQS-Based S3: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/AWS/SQS-basedS3




Fill out the appropriate AWS details.
For sourcetype, you must use 'cb:edr:s3'. For index, choose the index where you want to store the data.    

Verify Your Work

Verify data is coming in and you are seeing the proper field extractions by searching the data.
Example Search: index=cb sourcetype=cb:edr:* | stats values(vendor_type) by sourcetype
Notes:
If you see ""cb:edr:s3"" as a sourcetype, this add-on was not installed properly and will not work until you fix the underlying issue.
The ""vendor_type"" field should include all of the data types that you enabled in Carbon Black.
You should see, depending on what you enabled, up to three sourcetypes; cb:edr:watchlist, cb:edr:analytics, and cb:edr:endpoint.




(Optional, recommended) On your Search Head(s) edit the ""cb_edr_*"" Event Types to include the index you're storing these sourcetypes in.

Here is a breakdown of the prerequisites and these two components in this app:
Prerequisites and Configuration

You must use an existing Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring (formerly known as SignalFx) subscription that includes data, although a trial version works which is unlikely to have much data.
This app requires that you have also installed and configured the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring Technology Add-on here: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5247/, including realm and access key.
The Dashboards in this App use the data generated by Enabling the Modular Inputs included when you install this App. Therefore the first and only Configuration step after you install this app, is navigate to the Data Inputs menu of your core Splunk interface to Enable the modular inputs installed with this App. More details are in the documentation link below. 

Modular Inputs
This app includes Modular Inputs that use the new input type called ""Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring Data Streams"". When creating a new Modular Input of that type, you provide a SignalFlow query that accesses the SignalFx API to bring data into your own Splunk instance. This new modular type and how to use it is documented here: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SIMAddon/latest/Install/ModInput.
Dashboards
This App installs a set of Dashboards shown in the Menu bar when using this app. These Dashboards are based on the new Splunk Universal Dashboard Framework, and you can open each panel in Search to look how it was created. And you can use these as an example to help you design your own view of this data and make your own Dashboard.
More details on the Modular Inputs and Dashboards provided by this App
Smart Agent Hosts

This input gathers metrics from hosts where you installed the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring (formerly known as SignalFx) Smart Agent. This is a broadly installed agent that is used to gather metrics from the technology for that given host, for instance using collectd technology on your linux hosts. This input gathers basic infrastructure metrics, but you could modify this input's SignalFlow to get additional data that is generated in the Smart Agent you deploy. As Splunk develops additional metrics that are gathered by Smart Agent, you can modify this input to bring those additional metrics into core Splunk, as needed.

Docker Containers

This input gathers basic metrics from your Docker containers, such as numbers of containers and the resources used by those containers. This uses the Docker integration that exists in Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring (formerly known as SignalFx).

AWS EC2

This input brings in EC2 metrics such as Instances, Zones and assorted infrastructure metrics. Modifying this input would allow you to get any data that you have in SignalFx today, such as RDS, Lambda or possibly cost estimation features of AWS.

Azure Virtual Machines

This input gathers very similar metrics that other cloud providers publish around virtual machines, but includes Azure specific metrics that might be in your environment, such as Regions, etc. 

GCP Compute Engine

This input gives you similar metrics to the other cloud providers view of virtual machines, but once you modify these inputs, you can use specifics that Google has to identify these VMs such as 'project name', etc.

SAI Hosts

If you are a user of the Splunk App for Infrastructure (SAI), then this dashboard will use that same metrics index to provide a view that is very comfortable to users of Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring (formerly known as SignalFx).",Version 1.0.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/ad891716-149a-11eb-bb83-0a7b70f2f7b0.png,"IT Operations, DevOps",https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-general-terms.html,540,0,splunk,0,0,Splunk Works,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/splunklabs,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise

Splunk app containing configuration items, field extractions, and useful visualizations for Icecast logs.
Prerequisites
First, configure all Icecast servers you wish to ingest logs from to send logs to port 514 of your Splunk instance. Both TCP and UDP inputs are supported.
Install
Download the app from Splunkbase and restart Splunk instance. Select the Icecast App from the Apps dropdown, and follow the link labeled ""Continue to app setup page"" to complete installation. Enter the IP address or addresses of the Icecast servers as a comma-separated list, or use the * wildcard to accept logs from any device connecting on port 514 (not recommended, as this is the default syslog port). Uncheck the box labeled ""TCP Connection"" to recieve logs over UDP. Enter the name of the index you wish to ingest Icecast logs into. Click submit, and you'll immediately begin recieving logs.
In order to use the included visualizations, you'll need to upload a lookup CSV file containing your weekly radio schedule. This file should have the headers:
time,sunday,monday,tuesday,wednesday,thursday,friday,saturday

and each line should take the form:
<<NUMERICAL HOUR IN 24HR FORMAT>>,<<SUNDAY SHOWNAME>>,<<MONDAY SHOWNAME>>,<<TUESDAY SHOWNAME>>,<<WEDNESDAY SHOWNAME>>,<<THURSDAY SHOWNAME>>,<<FRIDAY SHOWNAME>>,<<SATURDAY SHOWNAME>>

If there is no show at a given day and hour, that entry on the CSV can be left blank. If there are no shows for a given hour, it is not necessary to include a line with that hour in the lookup CSV.
Upload the file to Splunk under the icecast_app context, and enter the name of the lookup file in the appropriate field in the visualizations.",Version 1.0.1,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/13582e2a-6666-11eb-80d2-02fa7700cf1c.png,"IT Operations, Utilities",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,80,0,splunk,0,0,Eric Lewis,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/kid_c_plus,"Products: Splunk Enterprise

SUPPORT
support@powerconnect.io
DOWNLOAD
https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3153/
INSTALLATION

This application needs to be installed on Splunk Search Head in the case of Distributed environment.
For Installation and Setup instructions, refer to the documentation here - https://www.powerconnect.io/install-steps/

UPGRADE STEPS
https://www.powerconnect.io/wiki/splunk-app-upgrade-guide-for-sap-powerconnect-app-6-x/
APP DEPENDENCY

The app makes use of a Splunk application ""Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit(MLTK)"" to incorporate machine learning usecases in certain dashboards, namely ""SAP Security Essentials"" and ""ABAP Dumps""

SETUP PAGE GUIDE
Section 1: Setup default values


In this section default filter values for the timerange and span can be set. These values are set to default across all the dashboards.


Note: This does not apply for ""Expensive Statements (raw)"" dashboards for databases.


Section 2: Database selection

In this section you can add/remove database menu entry from the navigation bar of the App.

Section 3: SAP Cloud selection

In this section you can add/remove SAP Cloud product menu entry from the navigation bar of the App.

CONFIGURATION

After performing above mentioned installation steps, configure the indexes to be accessible by admin and all other users and roles who will be accessing this application.
All SAP raw events are configured to provide TIMESTAMPs in UTC timezone. Configure the system and Splunk user timezone accordingly.
If any new field extraction is required to be done in props.conf for the [sap_abap] stanza, please verify the application is not affected by that change.
The Lookups need to be populated with the event data. This step is required to be performed only once as there are separate savedsearches scheduled to run every hour for appending new items to existing lookups from new events and for some cases it’s only to populate static data in the lookup for once only. There are two ways to complete this step:
Open the dashboard “Wizard for New SAP SIDs and Instances Discovery” under PowerConnect menu. Select the checkbox corresponding to the savedsearches name and click on the “Run Searches” button. The status of the search would get updated in the Status column of the table and the user can view the search results once the search has completed by clicking in the table cell. The step would be complete when all the searches specified in the table have completed execution successfully with the exception of “Cloud CPI Source - Lookup Gen - Run Once Only” search. This search should only be run if the user wants to use the “SAP Cloud - CPI Message Monitoring” dashboard.
On Splunk's menu bar, Click on Settings -> “Searches, reports, and alerts” and manually run all the savedsearches with the suffix ” – Run Once Only”. In case of a large number of events, if savedsearch execution does not get completed, try to reduce the time range and populate the lookups.



OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION


SAP CLOUD PRODUCT SUPPORT

If the user wants to use “SAP Cloud - CPI Message Monitoring” dashboard, the user needs to enable the saved search “Cloud CPI Source - Lookup Gen”.  The steps to enable the savedsearches are:
On Splunk's menu bar, Click on Settings -> Searches, reports, and alerts.
Search for “Cloud CPI Source - Lookup Gen”.
Click on ""Edit"" dropdown under ""Actions"" and click on ""Enable"".





GERMAN OR JAPANESE LANGUAGE SUPPORT

The app version 6.4.0 supports German and Japanese languages apart from English.

By default, Splunk automatically uses the language that the user's browser is set to. To switch languages, either the browser's locale setting can be changed or for a given Splunk session it can be changed by modifying the URL that you use to access Splunk. For different languages use the URL as specified:

German : http://<your_splunk_instance_address>/de-DE/app/BNW-app-powerconnect/
Japanese: http://<your_splunk_instance_address>/ja-JP/app/BNW-app-powerconnect/
American English: http://<your_splunk_instance_address>/en-US/app/BNW-app-powerconnect/
British English: http://<your_splunk_instance_address>/en-GB/app/BNW-app-powerconnect/

*(Replace the placeholder in the URL)
Note: In case the dashboard is not getting shown in the expected language after going to the appropriate URL, the user should clear the browser cache and refresh the dashboard.
    * The language translation of description (""Wizard for New SAP SIDs and Instances Discovery"" dashboard, ""Data Dictionary"" dashboard and ""Searches, Reports, and Alerts"" section) is supported for Splunk version 7.3.x and above.
    * Reference: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.0.6/Admin/Userlanguageandlocale




MACROS:

On Splunk's menu bar, Click on Settings -> “Advanced search” -> “Search Macros”.
Click on the “sap-index” macro and mention the index name in the Definition where data is incoming. Please see the sample below:
(index=""main"" OR index=""sample1"" OR index=""sample2"")
Note: For selecting all value of an entity, ""*"" (asterisk) can be used. Logical operators like ""AND"", ""OR"" should be capitalized when used in Definition.


Click on the Save Button.



DATA MODEL CONFIGURATION

Data Model Acceleration is disabled by default. Admin can enable acceleration and set the acceleration period by the following steps:
On Splunk's menu bar, Click on Settings -> Data models
From the list for Data models, click ""Edit"" in the ""Action"" column of the row for the Data model for which acceleration needs to be enabled.
From the list of actions select Edit Acceleration. This will display the pop-up menu for Edit Acceleration.
Check Accelerate check box to ""Enable"" data model acceleration.
If acceleration is enabled, select the summary range to specify the acceleration period.
To save acceleration changes click on the save button.


For additional details, please refer the following document:
https://www.powerconnect.io/wiki/kb-096-splunk-powerconnnect-app-datamodel-information/

REBUILDING DATA MODEL

In case there is no need to use the already indexed accelerated Data Model, the Data Model can be configured to rebuild from scratch for the specified acceleration period. Data Model can be rebuilt by the following steps:
On Splunk's menu bar, Click on Settings -> Data models
From the list for Data models, expand the row by clicking "">"" arrow in the first column of the row for the Data model for which acceleration needs to be rebuild. This will display an extra Data Model information in ""Acceleration"" section.
From the ""Acceleration"" section click on ""Rebuild"" link.
Monitor the status of the rebuild in the field ""Status"" of ""Acceleration"" section. Reload the page to get the latest rebuild status.



SAVEDSEARCHES

Below savedsearches are accelerated and acceleration might increase storage and processing costs. The user can change the acceleration option by following the steps given at the end of the section.

LOOKUP FILE MANUAL CONFIGURATION

In ""SAP Performance->User Experience (Geo)"" dashboard, ip_subnets lookup file is used for fetching predefined subnet, lat, long and text fields. On the basis of these fields, the panel will display bubbles on Geo Map.

To make ""SAP Global->User Experience (Geo)"" dashboard working properly, the user needs to manually insert subnet values in ip_subnets lookup file ($SPLUNK_HOME$/etc/apps/BNW-app-powerconnect/lookups/ip_subnets.csv).
For example:
subnet,lat,long,text // this line is already in ip_subnets.csv file.
XXX.XXX.XXX,-10.000,20.000,""Text Value"" //Sample value in ip_subnets.csv file.
.
.
.

Bot Ips:
This tap shows the current state of the Bot Ips feed. It provides information about the last inserted infected ips, as well as trends like most infected operating systems or the top 10 portal domains that bots are reporting data to a C&C.
This feed provide multiple lookup tables like infected ips, operating systems, C&Cs, etc.
Attacking Ips:
Attacking IPs dashboard shows the current state of your Splunk attacking IPs lookup tables. This feed allows you to monitor current threats in real-time and includes geolocation information about the attack, accurate timestamp data and attack categorization. Note this feature is only available to commercial users.
Malware:
The malware dashboard shows the current state of your Splunk malware hashed lookup tables. This provides a list of most recently analyzed malware samples where you can search for the file hash. This data is rated with confidence levels from LOW to HIGH and search queries can be filtered using this criteria. Note this feature is only available to commercial users.
Hacktivism:
In this last tap, hacktivism trends are previewed. The top plot is a HeatMap that shows the 
countries where a high level of hacktivism has been detected. The bottom plot gives 
information about the TOP 6 hacktivism hashtags over the last month.
Search:
On this view a threat analyst can create custom searches with multiple IOC inputs such as IP, 
Domain, as well as a filtering by a date range.  
Clicking on a result will open a new page and you will be able to adapt your search using 
Splunk's search engine to create a new custom dashboard or alerts.

Adds workflow actions so that an analyst either looking at the incident review dashboard, manually searching index=notable, or manually searching index=threat_activity can use the event actions to find the underlying threat events. (See screenshots)
How it works
These events contain all the components you need to get to the raw events, including:
- Timeframe (info_min_time and info_max_time)
- Sourcetype (e.g., websense, bluecoat, or what have you)
- Triggering fields (e.g., dest, file_name, etc.)
- Scoping fields (e.g., src, host, etc.)
There are then embedded in tokens in the search so that you will get any of the raw events. 
If you're a detail-oriented Splunker, you might notice that there are a few field extractions -- in the event of searching from index=notable or the incident review dashboard, we are looking at a twice-summaried event. The first is from raw event to index=threat_activity, and the second is from index=threat_activity to index=notable. These extractions allow us to make sure that we are gathering the correct field extractions to pull out our data.
What IOC Types are Supported
Currently, just src/dest based hits and filename based hits are supported. Adding any extras are really easy, I just don't have examples to make sure they work. Send me an example index=notable and/or index=threat_activity (preferably both) and I'll be happy to add support. Or add it yourself (it's not hard) by modifying the search and then send me the working version so that I can integrate it. 
How to Install
Easy -- just install the app on your search head -- no other work required.
What versions of ES are supported?
It has been tested on 4.0.x, but it should also work on 6.3.x

For more information about Growl and to download it visit http://growl.info/
Feedback
Please send your feedback to splunk at spp.at.
If you have questions/issues/ideas don't hesitate to ask them on Splunk Answers: http://answers.splunk.com/questions/tagged/app-growl-spp
Prerequisites:
- Growl has to be installed on your Mac OS X client machine.
- Your client machine has to be reachable on UDP Port 9887 for the Splunk Server (ie. not blocked by a firewall)
Installation:
On your client machine:
Setup growl to listen on the network for incoming notifications and enter a password to allow remote application registration. To do so go to System Preferences on your Mac > Growl > Network - See http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1160714/screens/growl_config_screen.png
On the Splunk Server:
Copy the growlnotify.py form the package to the following folder on your Splunk Server:   
$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/scripts

Make sure the script is executable:  
$ chmod a+x $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/scripts/growlnotify.py

Edit the growlnotify.py and enter the values for the following variables:
GROWL_HOST - Enter the IP Address of the client machine running Growl (eg. GROWL_HOST = ""192.168.0.33"")
GROWL_REGISTRATION_PASSWORD - Enter the password you've set in the Growl Preferences (eg. GROWL_REGISTRATION_PASSWORD=""changeme"")
Excute the growlnotify.py with \--register as argument. The script will send a registrations packet to the Growl daemon.
$ splunk cmd python growlnotify.py --register

You will get an entry in Growl > Applications where you can configure how Splunk notifications should look like.
Basic Usage
Set up a scheduled search and enter as alert action ""Trigger shell script"" and fill in growlnotify.py as the ""Filename of shell script to execute"". See http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1160714/screens/save_search_dialog.png
When the search is executed and the conditions match, the growlnotify script will be invoked which will send a notification to the Growl host using the saved search name as a title and the number of events as the message.
Advanced Usage
If you want to customize the message that is displayed within the Growl notification, you'll have to customize the search. Once the saved search name ends with ""--inline"", then the growlnotify script will take a look at each result of the search if it contains a field called ""growl_msg"" and will send a notification with the value of this field.
Example search:

Lookups
Gigamon® Visibility App for Splunk contains several KV Stores.
The KV Stores are descriptive in what they contain:  giga_clusters, giga_fms, giga_ports, giga_cards, giga_maps.
Configure Gigamon® Visibility App for Splunk
The only configuration out of the box is to connect the App with your GigaVUE-FM. You can do this by accessing the Credential Configuration page. It is located on the Menu under Administration -> Configuration Menu Item as GigaVUE-FM.
To change the location of the data from the main index, update the event type giga_idx with the appropriate index name. You must also change the Modular Input configuration to point to the new index.
For syslog and system event dashboards to get populated, individual Gigavue nodes need to be configured to send syslog to the Splunk instance where GigamonApp is installed. Also a data input need to be created on Splunk for syslog to ingest data from Gigamon nodes. 
Troubleshooting
If you find yourself in a situation where the Gigamon® Visibility App for Splunk doesn't work properly, or display the information you thought would be there, here are some simple troubleshooting steps to follow.
1.Start with the Gigamon Visibility App Health dashboard. It is found under the Administration section of the navigation.
1.Check the error sourcetype: sourcetype=GigamonForSplunk:error
1.Check the internal logs: index=_internal source=gigamon
1.Rebuild the lookups: Navigate to the Generate Lookups view under Administration -> Configuration navigation item.

What's New in version 2.0.0?
This version has been update to use the new Instana APIs for metrics.   Issues will be ported in the near future. 
This Add-On is now written and supported by Instana directly.
What's Needed?


Downloads

Instana App for Splunk
Instana Add-on for Splunk



Instana Information Required

Instana API tenanat URL   (https://your-account.instana.io)
Instana API Authorization Token




Instana Performance Metrics Configuration
Installation
The installation consists of installing both the Instana Add-on for Splunk and the Instana App for Splunk. 
  - The Add-on is responsible for executing the rest API calls and collecting the data from Instana.
  - The App provides a collection of dashboards and saved searches.  
To install, navigate to Apps --> Manage Apps and select the “Install app from File” button.  Specify the location of the file you downloaded and install it.   
Configuration
The Instana Add-on for Splunk contains a global configuration for your Instana account URL and API authorization token.  
Enter those values on the Configuration tab in the Add-on.  You will find the settings in the Add-On Settings tab.
Next, create a new Input for the data you wish to collect via the Inputs menu -> Create New Input option.  Each Input requires 4 parameters:
  - Input Name 
  - Pollling interval
  - Splunk Index to use
  - Instana search filter that you would like to run (you can copy this directly from Instana's search bar)
To retrieve metrics for all web applications and websites use this filter: 
entity.pluginId:logicalwebapp OR entity.pluginId:browserLogicalService
To retrieve metrics for all databases: 
entity.selfType:database 
Note: This Add-on can be used for entities (Instana Snapshots) that contains the following 4 metrics:
  - latency     ==> Average Response Time
  - count       ==> Calls per second
  - error_rate  ==> Error Rate
  - instances   ==> number of instances running this entity

Installation
The DDoS Detector for Splunk App and Technology Add-on for NetFlow  are designed to work together. To download Add-on please visit https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1838/
To download NFO please visit https://www.netflowlogic.com/downloads/
Contact trials@netflowlogic.com and request DDoS Detector Module for NFO.
This Module consists of six independent components, which we call experts, each specializing in its own domain of knowledge. All experts process all the flow records received by NetFlow Optimizer, apply their own analytics, and, if an attack is detected, send messages to the events correlator, indicating the type of detected attack, confidence level, and  a trend of the event characteristics dynamics (increasing, steady, or abating). The event correlator combines the information received from the experts, assigns weight to each reported event, and makes a final determination on reporting and its confidence in event validity.

Version: 1.0
Date: 1/5/15
Description: The Splunk App for IBM Tivoli Netcool has been created with two purposes in mind; monitor the application and monitor the contents of the application.
Supported Products: The App was built using Splunk 6.2 and Netcool 7.4 both running on *NIX platform.
Installation steps for a distributed deployment are as follows:
(for single server Splunk architectures perform steps 1,2, & 4)


Download.  
On the Search head:
  2a. Install via the Splunk GUI.
  2b. Copy $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SplunkForTivoliNetcool/addons/TA* files to the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ directory and uncompress.
  2c. Restart splunkd on the Search Head.  
Distribute the tech add-ons to your Indexers (as prescribed in step 2B) and restart splunkd.  
Universal Forwarder:
  4a. Install a universal forwarder on the Netcool Object Server.
  4b. Distributed the tech add-ons as prescribed in step 2B.
  4c. Restart splunkd on the universal forwarder.  


Input Requirements: As mentioned, inputs are defined for *NIX based installations, probable windows inputs exist in the comment section of the inputs.conf file.
TA-tivoli_netcool_omnibus: is set to monitor the application log files contained in the /opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/log/ & /opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/log/ directories. Default sourcetype is set to ‘app_log’ and modified via transform to reflect the file name preceding the .log extension. Index is set to ‘tivoli_app_log’. 
TA-tivoli_netcool_object_server: requires the configuration of a Netcool flat file gateway. Splunk will automatically parse key value pairs when the schema of alerts.staus changes. Sourcetype is set to ‘event’ and index is set to ‘tivoli_fault’.

A Splunk app that polls VMware(r) SD-WAN VCO event log for logging to Splunk. The VCO contains both SD-WAN Edge operational events such as Edge Up and Down, Link Down and Up, together with security activities such as users logging into the VCO and associated configuration changes.  
Although SD-WAN Edges can be configured to log to syslog, there are additional operational actviities that occur within the VCO which are of interest to IT Operations / Security Operations. 
I recommend a polling interval to VCO no less than 120 seconds and 300 seconds is what I regard as normal.
This app has been available for more than two years in the form of https://github.com/djsincla/TA_VeloCloud and was updated and renamed for hosting on Splunk. Source for this application is now available here: https://github.com/djsincla/ds_sdwan_events

The Github App for Splunk is a collection of out of the box dashboards and Splunk knowledge objects designed to give Github Admins and platform owners immediate visibility into Github.
This App is designed to work across multiple Github data sources however not all all required. You may choose to only collect a certain set of data and the parts of this app that utilize that set will function, while those that use other data sources will not function correctly, so please only use the Dashboards that relate to the data you are collecting.
The Github App for Splunk is designed to work with the following data sources:

Github Audit Log Monitoring Add-On For Splunk: Audit logs from Github Enterprise Cloud.
Github.com Webhooks: A select set of webhook events like Push, PullRequest, and Repo.
Github Enterprise Server Syslog Forwarder: Audit and Application logs from Github Enterprise Server.
Github Enterprise Collectd monitoring: Performance and Infrastructure metrics from Github Enterprise Server.

Dashboard Instructions
Installation
For Splunk Cloud, refer to Install apps in your Splunk Cloud deployment. For non-Splunk Cloud deployments, refer to the standard methods for Splunk Add-on installs as documented for a Single Server Install or a Distributed Environment Install.
This app should be installed on both your search head tier as well as your indexer tier.
Configuration

The Github App for Splunk uses macros so that index and sourcetype names don't need to be updated in each dashboard panel. You'll need to update the macros to account for your selected indexes.
The macro github_source is the macro for all audit log events, whether from Github Enterprise Cloud or Server. The predefined maco includes examples of BOTH. Update to account for your specific needs.
The macro github_webhooks is the macro used for all webhook events. Since it is assuming a single index for all webhook events, that is the predefined example, but update as needed.
Finally, the macro github_collectd is the macro used for all collectd metrics sent from Github Enterprise Server. Please update accordingly.

Dashboard Usage
Out of the box, there are a few categories of dashboards available:

Enterprise Server Monitor - A set of dashboards to monitor GitHub Enterprise Server infrastructure metrics. 
Audit - A set of dashboards that report on Audit logs events from both GitHub Enterprise Cloud and GitHub Enterprise Server.
Add-On Monitoring - Listed on the Dashboards page is a dashboard called Integration Monitoring that is used to keep an eye on how the Github Audit Log Monitoring Add-On for Splunk is working. This is only useful if you are using that Add-On and also requires access to Splunk _internal logs.

Support
Support for Github App for Splunk is run through Github Issues. Please open a new issue for any support issues or for feature requests. You may also open a Pull Request if you'd like to contribute additional dashboards, eventtypes for webhooks, or enhancements you may have.",Version 1.1.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/4ad85408-3b48-11ec-8927-1e372fd1d34c.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance, DevOps",https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-general-terms.html,"6,063",0,splunk,0,0,Splunk Works,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/splunklabs,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

Uses the Weather API for current weather data, and requires a valid OpenWeather API key. The free license allows up to 60 calls per minute.
Sourcetype:
This add-on uses the included sourcetype openweather:current:json for the collected events. The event timestamp is set after the dt field in the event data.
Installation:
Download and install directly from Splunk, or download from Splunkbase and untar the package in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ directory. 
Configuration:
Go to the OpenWeather Current Add-On for Splunk in the Splunk Enterprise menu and access the configuration section where you have to add the OpenWeather account with the associated API key as password. 
Next we need to configure an modular input in the Inputs section, here we need to define the index where Splunk is going to collect the events and the Interval for collection. It is recommended that you create a dedicate index for this data. 
Also is required to specify a localization method and fill the value field from this method. The available localization methods are: CityID, ZipCode, or Geolocalization (latitude, longitude), with the following values:


CityID: value: <city_id>. Example: 12345


ZipCode: value: <zip_code>,<country_code>. Example: 1234,cn


Geolocalization: value: <lat>,<lon>. Example: -12.34,56.78


The units of measurement setting allows to select one of the following options:


standard: temperature in Kelvin.


metric: temperature in Celsius.


imperial: temperature in Fahrenheit.

PLEASE NOTE: Users of older versions of this add-on may need to remove and re-install the app due to the a required re-name of the app. 
Installation and Setup
To install this app, simply deploy it to your search head(s) or deploy via normal search head cluster deployer mechanisms. The search head(s) will need network connectivity to the McAfee ePO server over the ePO port in use in your environment (default 8000 or 8443). Minimum ePO version is 4.6.
Once installed, you will need to confiugure it with ePO server information and access credentials. From the Splunk launcher or the app drop down menu, select the ""System Tagger for McAfee ePO"" App. First, configure your ePO server details by clicking ""Configuration"" and then ""Add-on Settings"" from within the app. 
Besides logging level and any required proxies between Splunk search heads and the ePO server (which you can configure on other tabs), you will need to specify 4 data points. You :
- ePO Server: This is a resolvable hostname or IP address of your McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator server
- ePO Port: This is the port of ePO server communications, usually 8000 (clear text, not recommended) or 8443 (encrypted, secure). This setting defaults to 8443, but change it if necessary.
- ePO User Name: This is the name of an existing account in McAfee ePO with permissions to apply system tags.
- ePO User Password: This is the above user's password. It is stored securely on the search head.
Save your changes, and you should be ready to use the add-on for apply and removing tags in ePO. You should also create any tags in McAfee ePO that you want to apply from within Splunk. Consult ePO documentation for instructions on how to do this.
You may also want to add data inputs at this point to collect data about available tags and systems from ePO. You do this from within the System Tagger for McAfee ePO App by clicking ""Inputs"" (the defaul view in the app) and then clicking ""Create New Input"" on the upper right. There are 2 types of inputs - tags and systems. You should create 1 for each type of input, specifying the frequency in seconds (this shouldn't need to more than a few times per day in most cases), index, and a unique name for the input. ePO server location and credentials used for these inputs are taken from the previous configuration step.
Add-On Usage
There are 2 ways to use this add-on: 1) as a custom alert action in Splunk Enterprise 6.3+ or, 2) as an Adaptive Response Framework action (automated or ad-hoc) in Splunk Enterprise Security 4.5+.
To configure a custom alert action, simply create a Splunk search that results in data indicating that there are systems that you want to tag or untag. Note which field in the search results contains the value of the system name you want to tag in ePO (e.g. host, dest, src, dvc, ComputerName, etc.). Save your search as an Alert, schedule it in the normal way, and then under the actions section, Add Action - McAfee ePO System Tagger. You should also set it to trigger ""for each result"" instead of just once, so that each system in the search results will be tagged properly. 
The Alert Action will ask for 3 mandatory items:
- Action: You can either apply a tag to a system in ePO or remove a tag if the system already has that tag applied.
- Tag to Apply: This tag must already exist in ePO and the spelling must match the tag as it exists in ePO. This tag will be applied to the systems in ePO that come back in the search results.
- Field for System Name: This is the search results field from which the action will derive the system name as it matches the system name in ePO. You must use specify it in token format meaning $result.<yourField>$. Common examples might be $result.host$, $result.src$ or $result.dest$. Use whichever field in your search results provides the desired system name to be matched in ePO.
To use this add-on as an Adaptive Response Framework action in Splunk Enterprise Security 4.5 or higher, the instructions are essentially the same, except you will add the alert action when you configure the Correlation Search in Enterprise Security. It can be set to automatically tag or untag the system when the Correlation Search returns a result, or you can expose the ability to tag systems ad hoc to analysts as they review a Notable Event in the Incident Review Dashboard. In either case, the user will have to supply the tag name and field for system name as described above. 
Search and Dashboard Panels
If you have configured the inputs as described above in the Installation and Setup section, you will be able to search for ePO tag or system data using ""sourcetype=mcafee:epo:tag OR sourceptype=mcafee:epo:systems"", respectively. 
The add-on also includes 4 pre-build dashboard panels, which you can add to any new or existing dashboard in Splunk. These can be added when editing a dashboard (in edit panels mode) by clicking the ""Add Panel"" button, expanding the ""Pre-Build Panel"" section on the right, and choosing one of the panels that begins with ""System Tagger."" The 4 include panels return a list select fields for all tags, all systems, and allow free-form text search for any tag or system name.
The purpose of adding these inputs and pre-built panels into this add-on is to give admins a clear picture of the available tags and system names in ePO that can be used in the custom alert actions and/or Adaptive Response actions. Additionally, system admins and security analysts might find the available ePO system information valuable for other purposes. 
Troubleshooting
If systems are not getting tagged/untagged in ePO as expected, there could be several causes: network connectivity, permissions, typos in or failure to configure the setup screen, referencing tags that don't exist in ePO, mismatch on system name between Splunk and ePO, etc.
As a general troubleshooting method you can use Splunk to look at the logs. An admin, you can run:
index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd component=sendmodalert action=""mfe_epo_system_tagger""
In addition, anyone with access to the main index can find the add-on script's logging by searching:
index=main sourcetype=epotagger
Another good method to troubleshoot is to attempt to tag a system manually using Curl or a similar command line tool from the Splunk search head itself. It will look something like this:
curl -k -u MYUSER:MYPASSWORD ""https://MYEPOSERVER:MYEPOPORT/remote/system.applyTag?names=MYSYSTEMTOTAG&tagName=MYTAGTOAPPLY""
A positive result from the curl command say ""OK: 1"" to indicate 1 tag was applied. ""OK: 0"" could be a problem or could simply indicate that the system is already tagged with that tag. Anything else indicates an issue.",Version 1.2,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/529bc83c-18a2-11e7-8b50-02f13bdc2585.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-software-license-agreement.html,668,0,splunk,4,3,Splunk Works,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/splunklabs,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

For support, please email support@discoveredintelligence.ca
What is it?
Sendresults is an immensely powerful, life-changing Splunk command and alert action developed by Discovered Intelligence that allows you to send tabulated search results to individuals dynamically, based upon the data within the results. This means that you no longer need to hardcode an email into the search, but can evaluate the email instead.
Example Use Cases
The Use Cases are wide and far reaching. Here are some examples of where Sendresults might be useful:
Security

Sendresults to individuals who are locked out of their accounts with instructions on how to reset their password or get their account unlocked.
Sendresults to individuals or incident responders about identified security incidents relevant to them specifically

Operations

Sendresults to internal business customers with a report on their Splunk license usage for a given period of time
Sendresults of high severity to one person and send results of a lower severity to the whole team. Alternatively, sendresults to one person but include the whole team, when the severity is high.

How is this different to the email action or sendemail command?
Quite different and a lot more dynamic. The email action and sendemail command allows a user to send the results of a search to an email address hardcoded into the alert or search string. The problem here is that you have to state the email address(es) upfront within the search and all of the results go to the specified email address(es). However, using Sendresults, you can dynamically evaluate the email from the individual results and send some results to one individual and other results to other individuals.
Key Features
We have worked hard to ensure that Sendresults is not only simple to use, but also contains awesome functionality. Here are the key features of the command:

Dynamically evaluate who to send results to, the email subject, email body, and the email footer, based upon the results of the search itself
Send only relevant search results to an individual
BCC additional email addresses if necessary
A simple command and alert action – no scripting or coding required
Uses the built in email configuration of Splunk
Parse inline CSS to customise the look of the tabulated results
Specify a limit on the amount of results sent
Email group, comma separated or individual email addresses
It’s totally free! (Although, if you are looking for Splunk Services click here).

Installation
The app is super simple to install.

Download the app from Splunkbase
Install the app on a search head or search head cluster.
Restart Splunk
Use the commmand in a search and/or create an alert with a Sendresults action!

Usage
When using either the Search Command or Alert Action version of Sendresults there must be a field named email_to within the results that are being passed into Sendresults. Ideally data should be formatted in tabular format. The value of the email_to field will be used to group the results together. The value of this field must be a valid email address or a comma separated list of email addresses. If email_subj or email_body or email_footer fields are also present in the results, the first value of those fields for each email_to will set the corresponding field in the email.
Search Command
The Search Command version of Sendresults supports the following syntax and optional arguments:
sendresults [sender=string] [subject=string] [body=string] [footer=string] [maxrcpts=int] [msgstyle=string] [format_columns=string] [bcc=string] [showresults=boolean] [showemail=boolean] [showsubj=boolean] [showbody=boolean] [showfooter=boolean]

Alert Action
Configure an alert through the normal means (GUI or savedsearches.conf) and add a Sendresults action with the following options:
Sender: The sender (from) address of the emails - requires quotes. Defaults to Splunk SMTP setting. The same sender is used for all emails sent and not customizable on a per-email basis.
Subject: The subject of the emails. If set, will override any value in an email_subj field in the results. If no subject is defined it will default to: ""Splunk Alert!""
Message Body: The body of the emails. If set, will override any value in an email_body field in the results. If no body is defined then it will default to ""You are receiving this e-mail because a set of sensitive events detected by a splunk search contained your e-mail as the responsible party.

Show the ""email_to"" field: When checked, allows the email_to column of the results to be visible in the emails that are sent out.
Show the ""email_subj"" field: When checked, allows the email_subj column of the results to be visible in the emails that are sent out.
Show the ""email_body"" field: When checked, allows the email_body column of the results to be visible in the emails that are sent out.
Show the ""email_footer"" field: When checked, allows the email_footer column of the results to be visible in the emails that are sent out.
Examples
Example 1: Send web access search results with a method of ""POST"" to one email address and search results with a method of ""GET"" to another.
...| eval email_to=case(method==""GET"",""email_1@discoveredintelligence.ca"",method==""POST"",""email_2@discoveredintelligence.ca"")
| sendresults subject=""Splunk Internal Results"" body=""Here are the internal Splunk results for you to review"" msgstyle=""table {font-family:Arial;font-size:12px;border: 1px solid black;padding:3px}th {background-color:#AAAAAA;color:#fff;border-left: solid 1px #e9e9e9} td {border:solid 1px #e9e9e9}""

Example 2: Build the email address to send to from the user_id field in the results.
…| eval email_to=user_id.""@discoveredintelligence.ca"" | sendresults

Example 3: Take the current email address and append a hardcoded CC address to the dynamic email address.
…| eval email_to=email."",my_cc_email@discoveredintelligence.ca"" | sendresults

Example 4: Send web access search results with 500 status codes to one email address and search results with 400 status codes to another with a customized email subject.
…| eval email_to=case(status>=500,""email_1@discoveredintelligence.ca"",status>=400,""email_2@discoveredintelligence.ca"")
| eval email_subj=case(status>=500,""Critical Severity Errors"",status>=400,""High Severity Errors"") | sendresults

Example 5: Specify a limit of 500 rather than the default of 200 and choose not to display the email column in the emails being sent out.
…| sendresults maxrcpts=500 showemail=f

Example 6: Bring in a lookup containing values X and Y depending on the result, then send results containing an X to one email and results containing a Y to another.
…| lookup field1 AS field1 OUTPUT xyfield AS xyfield
| eval email_to=case(xyfield==""X"",""email_1@discoveredintelligence.ca"", xyfield==""Y"",""email_2@discoveredintelligence.ca"")
| sendresults

Example 7: Highlight the ""count"" cell with a red backround which have a count > 10.
...| eval count-class=if(count&gt;10,""alert"","""")
| sendresults msgstyle=""table {font-family:Arial;font-size:12px;border: 1px solid black;padding:3px}th {background-color:#4F81BD;color:#fff;border-left: solid 1px #e9e9e9} td {border:solid 1px #e9e9e9} .alert {background-color:red;}"" format_columns=""count""

The above examples are for the command version of Sendresults, but to use with the Sendresults Alert Action remove the | sendresults portion of the search and configure the saved search as an alert with the Sendresults Alert Action added using the desired configuration options.
Logging
Of course, this being Splunk, we have to include some logging for completeness! The sendresults command has a dedicated log file for your viewing and indexing pleasure. The location of the log file is SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/sendresults.log and it contains error logs, in addition to informational messages about how many results were sent out and to whom they were sent to.
Logs can be viewed using:
index=_internal sourcetype=sendresults:log

Troubleshooting
I get tons of fields in my emails, but only want to see a few

You should declare the fields you want to see through the use of commands like | fields, | table or | stats.

I see a lot of fields in the email results, but I do not want to see these

You can use something like | fields - _* to remove these fields and stop them being inserted into the email results. Bear in mind you might want to see the _time field, so you could | rename this field to time or similar, then do | fields - _* to eliminate the other underscored fields.

I don’t want to see the email fields in my results

Quickly see all calls matching any search filters.
Drilldown at any time to thoroughly investigate a particular call.
Click your way to pretty much any report over any combination of fields.

That third bullet sounds a little crazy - what about some examples?
You can:

create reports around concurrent calls and dropped calls.
create a chart of usage stats about your hunt groups.
see and share inbound/outbound call stats by agent or department.
create custom call quality reports and dashboards (MOS, jitter, latency, packet loss).
build utilization reports by device, device_type, sites, buildings, you name it.
drilldown at any time from any report, to inspect and sanity check the calls themselves.
but really, pretty much anything. Try it and see.

What are these, reports? dashboards? alerts?
Yes. For any of those use cases (and any you can dream up), you can:

create graphs, charts, tables, and even mapping visualizations of various kinds and package them into dashboards if you like.
set up alerting around anything - dropped calls, quality, volume thresholds.
share any and all of the above as dashboards with different teams and colleagues.
automate dashboards you created, to send pdf’s of themselves out every day/week.

What about my report that I don't see listed here?
Contact us and we'll help you learn how to create what you need for your own “somewhat unusual” CallManager deployment. There are over 200 fields (Check them out here). If you can in principle calculate the thing you need from some number of those fields, in some product or by hand, then we can show how to make the app do it.
Can I try it out?
Yes you can download the app from Splunkbase or from this site, and you can get a 90 day trial license string from this site. You can set the whole thing up yourself with your own live data, in about 30 minutes. See our installation and setup docs here.
Pricing
The app is priced by the size of your CallManager deployment - specifically the total number of User Licenses and Unassigned Device Licenses that are in use, in CallManager itself. At and below 400 such licenses in use, the cost is only $1,200 per year, but we have a range of customers at all scales from below 100 to above 50,000 licenses in use. Send us a screenshot of the total licenses in use from PLM, or a screenshot per cluster of the ""License Usage Report"" in CM Admin and we can let you know the exact cost.
Splunk Enterprise - do I need it?
Yes. The majority of our prospects are already Splunk Enterprise customers, and if this is you, this app will likely add only a negligible additional load to ingest the CallManager data that it needs. If you're not, Sideview is also a Splunk Reseller in North America so we can help you on that side.
How about Splunk Cloud?
Yes the app is vetted for Splunk Cloud. We do recommend that you contact us before proceeding though.
What versions of CUCM are supported?
CUCM 7.0 up to the current release 12.X
What are the actual data sources that it uses?

CUCM CDR - through Callmanager's own ""external billing server"" mechanism, CUCM will basically SFTP this data right to Splunk. See our install docs for full steps. 
CUCM CMR - these are the call quality records, and they come in via the same mechanism
CUBE CDR - This is an optional secondary data source.  see docs for more details
Syslog - Although the App's UI does not currently integrate anything from the syslog events yet, we do have documentation on how to pull them in.

However if the data you're hoping to work with isn't in that list, Feel free to contact us anyway!.",Version 6.2.2,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/85580642-7003-11ec-973b-e6c1b0396c73.png,IT Operations,https://sideviewapps.com/sideview-trial-internal-use-license-agreement/,"8,454",0,splunk,5,14,Sideview LLC,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/sideview_llc,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

Welcome to the Splunk for Squid app! This app provides field extractions for Squid access logs as well as a dashboard and a request search interface.
This app is maintained by Patrik Nordlen. Suggestions and bug reports are appreciated.
Installation
To install, extract the .spl file in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps
You will need to enable the appropriate inputs, either via inputs.conf, or through the Manager in the Splunk GUI. Splunk for Squid expects Squid access logs to have a sourcetype of ""squid"".
Using Splunk for Squid
Field extractions
The most basic feature provided by this app is to extract fields from Squid access logs. The following fields are extracted:

duration (Time in milliseconds required for handling the request)
clientip (Client IP address)
action (Resulting action for a request, like TCP_HIT or TCP_MISS for instance)
http_status (The HTTP status returned for a request)
bytes (The amount of bytes returned to client, including headers)
method (HTTP method)
uri (Requested URI)
uri_host (Host portion of the requested URI)
uri_path (Path portion of the requested URI)
username (Username associated with the client connection)
hierarchy (Hierarchy data tags)
server_ip (The IP address of the destination host)
content_type (Content type for data returned)

These field extractions are applied to all logs with sourcetype ""squid"".
Request search
The app includes a custom search interface for Squid requests, available under ""Request search"". This interface shows tables and statistics for requests handled by Squid.
Dashboards
A traffic dashboard is provided, showing statistics over time for amount of requests and bandwidth consumed, as well as statistics concerning most prominent client IP addresses and destination sites.",Version 0.2,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/6d35ee3e-6900-11e3-b4de-005056ad5c72.png,IT Operations,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,"7,541",0,splunk,5,10,Patrik Nordlén,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/patrik,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

CRIT), you have to leverage search.log. Indexing it isn't scalable though. This app will, every five minutes, launch a scripted input that will review the local dispatch directory for any search.log files, and the parse out the details into a JSON blob that will be put in index=_internal.Details so far: * Per Search Peer: # of Results * Per Search Peer: Amount of time reported * Time to set up search peers * Count by log level of the search (e.g., INFO / WARN / ERROR / FATAL) * Count by log operator of the search (e.g., “SearchOperator:kv” vs LMConfig) * Time taken per operation (e.g., how many slow operations were there, how many fast ones — this can help identify particularly expensive regex / eval, etc.) * SearchID * Time RunOverall, this should allow some trending information, and specifically to be able to detect an indexer that is slower than the rest.",Version 1.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/image/default_icon.png,Utilities,https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,314,0,splunk,0,0,David Veuve,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/dveuve,"Products: Splunk Enterprise

By conforming to the Splunk Common Information Model, the TA enables integration with Splunk's Enterprise Security App.
NOTE: This TA inverts Damballa's mental model of Source (victim) and Destination (C&C) so that the fields can be represented within Splunk's Enterprise Security App Network Intrusion section.  As such, the victim device will be represented within Splunk as the 'Destination' and the C&C or internet location referenced in the event will be represented as 'Source'.
Configuration of Splunk integration with Damballa Failsafe can be achieved within 'System | Integration Settings'. Please see Damballa Failsafe Splunk Integration guide on support.damballa.com for more information.  
This TA is compatible with Failsafe 5.2.0 and later.

Getting started
This app is not ""visible"" in the Splunk UI app menu. After installing the app, follow this process:
1. Do a search of any data and switch to the visualisation tab
2. In the top left, in the visualisastion menu, select ""Heat Grid viz""
3. Open the ""Format"" menu then select ""Help""
4. There will be a link to the in-app documentation, which includes working examples

Usage
This visualisation expects data with specific field names. Use | rename to make sure your fields match what is expected. Every row of data will become a cell in the heatgrid. Data must always have ""value"" or ""color"" field (not both). If the ""value"" field is provided, the color will be automatically set based on the selected color gradiant. It is also possible to explicitly set color in the data by providing a ""color"" field.
...some search... | table value tooltip group

These are the fields that can be provided in data:
value - Numeric - This is the value that is used to determine the color of this cell. By default expected range is between 0 and 100. If the range of your data is different, then change the 'data range' option in the 'format' menu. Either this or the 'color' field below is mandatory.
color - String - The color of the cell can be explicity set by passing in a valid html color code (E.g. ""#FFFFFF"", ""red"", or ""rga(0,255,0)""). Either this or 'value' field above must be supplied.
tooltip - String - The contents to show on the tooltip when this cell is hovered.
tooltip_value - String - Specify what value should be shown on the tooltip when hovering this cell. For example, to set a % sign: | eval tooltip_value = value + "" %""
tooltip_html - String - Providing this field will override the other tooltip fields and will allow fully custom HTML content. For example: | eval tooltip_html = ""Location: Sydney</br>Owner: Operations</br>Value: <strong>"" + value + "" %<strong>""
group - String - If the group field is provided then cells with the same value will be grouped together with a label. Note that groups with only a few items in them may not layout very well. Squares and hexagons shapes allow for the most efficient use of space.
drilldown - String - If supplied, clicking the cell will cause a token to be set with this value. The default token is heatgrid_viz_drilldown but it can be changed in the 'Format' menu.
drilldown_url - String - If supplied, will cause this URL to be opened in a new tab/window when the cell is clicked.


Formatting options


If an ""override color"" is set, this will always override the selected color scheme.
The ""override color"" can be a single HTML color code (e.g. #00ff00) and a color gradiant will be generated automatically. Otherwise set a space separated list of multiple color codes.

Splunk Enterprise data analytics help organizations leverage the data that their infrastructure and security tools provide to understand their security posture, pinpoint and investigate risks, and create alerts and reports. Security operations teams must also rapidly respond to any identified threats, violations and attacks in a prioritized manner. Any delay in response can result in significant security risks. The integrated combination of the Forescout platform’s continuous, agentless device visibility, network access control, dynamic segmentation and workflow orchestration capabilities with Splunk Enterprise’s data mining and Splunk Enterprise Security (ES)'s security information and event monitoring (SIEM) capabilities provides a solution that maximizes insight, dramatically reduces risk and increases operational efficiency.  
Security blind spots are removed by having Splunk easily consume comprehensive information from Forescout such as:
•    Real-time inventory of all network connected virtual and physical devices across IT, BYOD, Guest, IoT and Operational Technology (OT), including new devices with an IPv6 address. Device data can also be sent without dependency on IP address for reporting flexibility. 
•    Endpoint information, such as device type, classification, network connection, operating system, applications, users, peripherals and much much more
•   More accurate user and location context by resolving overlapping IP addresses and layering tenant ID with IP address in meta data
•   Device security posture and compliance gaps
•   Authentication, access, tenant ID and network location information
•   Threat indicators on devices detected by vulnerability scanning
Use Cases
Capitalizing on Forescout's rich contextual information and policy-driven actions together with Splunk helps you tackle the following use cases.
Rapid anomaly detection and accurate trend analysis
Forescout discovers, classifies and assesses all connected devices; compiles this information in the Splunk CIM format and shares it with Splunk. The additional device information from Forescout includes user information, device type, device configuration, network access patterns over time, network location and security posture. Splunk correlates rich contextual data from Forescout with other data sources and uses this information for long-term storage, swift anomaly detection and accurate trend analysis.
Enhanced incident correlation and prioritization
Splunk correlates rich device context from the Forescout platform with other data sources to better identify and prioritize incidents. When Splunk receives alerts from other data sources about a suspicious activity on a device, it shares the information with Forescout. Forescout provides high-value user, network and device context to Splunk. Splunk leverages this additional insight to determine if a suspicious event is actually malicious or violates policy and escalates or reduces the severity of the event based on the device and user context, such as highly privileged or less trusted users.
Automated closed-loop incident response
Forescout scans all connected devices for indicators of compromise (IOCs) and policy violations in real time when alerted by Splunk. Through Splunk’s Adaptive Operations Framework, Splunk operators can initiate Forescout actions—such as isolating or quarantining potentially compromised or noncompliant endpoints depending on the severity of the violation. Forescout can also dynamically trigger policy-based mitigation and response actions until the deviant device is remediated. Forescout then delivers the results back to Splunk to close the loop. Administrators can view the entire lifecycle and final outcome of the event in the Splunk dashboard.
Architecture Overview

Forescout integration with Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud and Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) is enabled by the 
Forescout eyeExtend for Splunk module paired with the Forescout App for Splunk along with the Forescout Adaptive Response and Forescout Technology Add-ons for Splunk.   
The Forescout App for Splunk provides customizable, out-of-the-box queries and dashboards to visualize Forescout data in Splunk, displaying a wealth of information such as:
• Device compliance status
• User types (registered corporate users or guests)
• Device types connected to the network and connection details
• Patterns of network access over time
• Policy trends
• Forescout system health information
• Incident response action status
The Forescout Technology Add-on for Splunk is a required component to streamline data transfer between Forescout and Splunk Enterprise. This Add-on maps Forescout collected device properties to the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) and extracts events based on Forescout data. The Forescout Technology Add-on also maintains Forescout credentials for communications between Forescout and Splunk Enterprise. 
Support for Splunk Adaptive Operations Framework with The Forescout Adaptive Response Add-on

Splunk's Adaptive Operations Framework describes a complete action flow, which includes requesting an action be applied to an endpoint device and tracking the status of the action taken. 
This integration supports the Splunk Adaptive Operations workflow as follows:
-The Forescout App for Splunk maintains a list of available actions from the Forescout platform. Splunk can instruct the Forescout platform to respond to potential threats by applying any of these actions to endpoints that match search/trend criteria.
-To complete the action flow, the Forescout platform reports the status of actions applied to endpoints.
These closed-loop incident response workflows allow you to streamline security operations and minimize business risk by automating the incident management lifecycle with a complete audit trail that also helps with policy refinements.

The module expects geoinformation in the form of a ISO3166-2 country code or state code 
in the specified field in order to plot the results on the map. It's possible to define 
an optional countField which allows to process already aggregated results.
Example:
<module name=""HiddenSearch"" layoutPanel=""panel_row1_col1"" autoRun=""true"">
    <param name=""search"">sourcetype=access_combined clientip=* | geoip clientip</param>
    <param name=""earliest"">-24h@h</param>
    <module name=""VectorMap"">
        <param name=""mapType"">world</param>
        <param name=""field"">clientip_country_code</param>
        <param name=""backgroundColor"">#333333</param>
    </module>

I am a Splunk Professional Services consultant working for JDS Australia (https://www.jds.net.au), in Sydney, Australia.
What does this app do?
Enables an alert action that can send customised HTTP/REST requests to an endpoint. You can use search results from the alert to populate all the core fields of of the request including endpoint, headers, query string parameters and payload.
How does it work
After creating an alert, add the HTTP Alert Action at the bottom of the dialog. From there populate the fields as required. For most of the fields you can parameterise data by enclosing the fields in {field_name}. Additional fields are seperated by &
For example, you could set a custom header with the following X-Forwarded-For={host}&Authorization=Splunk {token}
The fields you specify must exist exactly as named in the search results or substitution will be skipped for that section. ie If you have a payload of data={ThisFieldDoesNotExist} and querystring of param={ThisFieldDoesExist} then payload won't do substituion but querystring will.

Scheduling Inspector identifies search coverage gaps for scheduled searches and provides an automated tool for correcting them. Coverage gaps are bad for Splunk because the time between each scheduled run of a search is greater than the time window in which your search runs. In this case, a search may miss the oldest data in the time window producing incomplete results.
Scheduling Inspector also identifies searches with excessive time windows. If the time between each run of scheduled search is less than the time window of your search, then mulitple runs may return overlapping results. Not only does the search use more system resources than necessary in this case, but it also may produce duplicate alerts or summary index events. With the workload based pricing model now being prevelent in Splunk, optimizing your scheduled searches in this way can help to keep your Splunk Cloud costs down.
Key Features
- Reveals misconfigured Scheduled Searches that are missing data based on its schedule and time range
- Illuminates misconfigured Scheduled Searches that are producing overlapping searches on data, possibly wasting system resources.
- Provides tools to investigate searches further and edit their SPL if necessary.
- Automation to easily fix any identified search in 2 button clicks, to catch missing data or reduce overlapping time ranges.
- Identifies orphaned searches and provides an automated process to reassign them to active Splunk owners.",,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/d589789c-da91-11eb-bd95-0a44f07378b7.png,Utilities,,3,0,splunk,5,10,Kinney Group,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/atlasproductteam,

How do twitter users feel about your company over time? 
How do people in California vs Texas feel about various issues? 
How is your marketing or tech support performing against competitors?

This app includes:

two trained datasets (twitter and imdb)
three search commands:
sentiment to predict user sentiment
language to predict what language an event is written in
tokens to make it easier to tokenize terms and phrases for analyzing text
heat to measure how emotionally charged a text is



From a command shell, you can train it on your own data. The training produces a (naive bayes classifier) model file used for the sentiment command, but training also outputs a lookup table of a few thousand terms and their expected sentiment rating, so the vocabulary can be tweaked and used with lookup commands to also do some basic sentiment analysis.
A note about accuracy: Over the twitter data, assuming 50-50 positive and negative tweets, it's about 70% accurate. Assuming the actual distribution of tweets, which seems to be about 75% positive, it's about 85% accurate. The most important part is not the accuracy on any given text but on the aggregate -- to see how sentiment trend over time or how ""google"" vs ""apple"" compare with other.",Version 1.3,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/0e03296e-cf25-11e3-9e7c-06f33efac1cf.png,"Business Analytics, Utilities",http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,"4,845",0,splunk,4,8,David Carasso,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/carasso,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5598,2022-01-10,08:00:19 AM,Jira Reporter App,,"June 23, 2021","Introduction:
The app consists in several dashboards that manages to visualize the data fetched by the “Jira Tracking Add-on for Splunk”. The main dashboard serves as a summary and contains drilldowns that link to information dashboards, such as Issues or Worklogs. The information dashboards shows in table format the collected worklogs events from Jira, grouped or organized diferently by the main dashboard indicators.
Prerequisites:
This app was tested under Splunk Enterprise 8.1 and 8.2.
Requires the following apps installed:
Jira Tracking Add-on for Splunk (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5547/ )
Lookup File Editor (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1724/ )
Architecture:
The app by default doesnt show Splunk bar or Edit bar, it can be modified changing the settings in each dashboard XML file: <form hideSplunkBar=""true"" hideEdit>.
The app contains the following knowledge objects:
Dashboards:
General Insights: App main dashboard, contains the main indicators and visualizations. All other dashboards are accesible from this view keeping the same filters as the main view.
Projects Insights: accesible through Project indicator drilldown in the main view.
Issues Insights: accesible through Issues indicator drilldown in the main view.
Worklogs Insights: accesible through Worklogs indicator drilldown in the main view.
User Insights: accesible through Users indicator drilldown in the main view.
Hours Insights: accesible through “Hours Worked” indicator drilldown in the main view.
Baseline Insights: accesible through “Resource Usage” indicator drilldown in the main view.
Search macros:
baselinedays(2): filters weekends from worked hours and baseline queries.
index_jira_issues: defines issues index for Jira events from the Jira Tracking Addon.
index_jira_worklogs: defines worklogs index for Jira events from the Jira Tracking Addon.
issue_done_status: defines the condition required for a terminated/finalized issue.
startedtimefilter(2): filters the worklogs by the started time field in contrast to event time.
baseline_overlay: defines baseline drawings for visualizations.
Nav:
default: main navegation controls, contains links to main dashboard, setup, search and logout.
Lookups:
baseline_hours.csv: this lookup file defines the baseline hours for each Jira user id. Can be accessed through a link in the bottom of the main dashboard(admin only) or through the Lookup Editor App.
Installation and configuration:
Install and configure the Jira Tracking Addon for Splunk.
Install the Jira Reporter App for Splunk.
Edit the following macros, they need to match the current index configuration (both macros can use the same index). Eg: index=jira.
index_jira_issues.
index_jira_worklogs.
Edit the macro “issue_done_status” to match the condition that defines a finalized issue. Eg: ""fields.status.statusCategory.name""=Done.
If necesary, edit the macro “lookup_user_baseline” to define another CSV file for the baseline.
If necesary, edit the macro “baseline_overlay” to define baseline drawings for visualizations.
Complete the lookup “baseline_users.csv” with the information of the current Jira users and their baselines.
If necesary, edit the following section of the XML sourcecode of the main dashboard to change the admin role for the lookup editor link.
<search>
    <query>|rest /services/authentication/current-context |return $roles</query>
    <earliest>-1s@h</earliest>
    <latest>now</latest>
    <done>
      <eval token=""Roles"">$result.search$</eval>
      <eval token=""ShowPanelLookup"">if(like($result.search$,""%admin%"") ,""1"", null)</eval>
    </done>
</search>
Common use cases:
Review total project hours, total issues hours, reported worklogs. 
Review users performance and utilization.
Review projects and issues total time spent.
Developement and known issues:
The addon that captures the issues and worklogs gets update events from Jira REST API but doesnt get the event that ocurrs when a Jira object is deleted. This situation leads to a state where we cannot determine when a issue or worklog was deleted and we need to reorganize the Jira index, cleaning the index and checkpoints and then fetching all the events again to match the current state. 
To avoid this situation we are not allowing the users to delete Jira objects, instead they are moved to an specific project created to store the “deleted” objects.
The events are indexed by event ocurring time and not by the started time of the worklog. This situation leads to a state where events are indexed into Splunk by their “updated time” and not by their “started time”, so if a user reports today a worklog time from the past (or the future) then the event gets indexed with the actual time (update time) that doesnt match the time when the worklog actually ocurred (started time).
To get by this situation we are searching with an all time range and using a macro “startedtimefilter” to filter events based on their started time. This aproach has a severe performance impact when the volume of the index is big. You can set a diferent time range window at the cost of not getting the events that started outside the window.
The current version does not consider holidays as non workable days. Might be added in the future.

PREREQUISITES

Splunk running on Linux OS (does not currently run on Splunk installations on Microsoft)
Tenable Nessus scanner 6.x
Python 2.7 on Splunk indexer
Python ""requests"" module on Splunk indexer
This is included in this TA under the ""bin"" directory for more info on requests see http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install/.

DESCRIPTION
The Add-on for Nessus allows a Splunk administrator to ingest Nessus vulnerability information directly from the Nessus product using an API.
This provides the index- and search-time functions for the vulnerability data by converting the output of Nessus web API calls into JSON documents via a python scripted input.
By default, this TA will create files and place them in the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-nessus_json/drop directory. Once this creation process is completed, they will be moved to the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-nessus_json/pickup directory. A monitor stanza in the inputs.conf file will then acquire the Nessus JSON data from the pickup directory.
INSTALLATION
The add-on needs to be installed on the indexer and the searchhead if in a distributed environment. In non-distributed environments, the indexer and searchhead are the same device and will only need to be installed at this central point.
GUI Installation:

Download the app from Splunkbase
From the Splunk web interface, click on App -> Manage Apps to open the Apps Management page in Manager
Click the ""Install app from file"" button, locate the downloaded file, and click ""Upload""

Command Line Installation:

Download the app from Splunkbase
Uncompress the tar file and move the entire app folder to the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps location
Restart the Splunk service/process (using either the UI (Settings/Server Controls/Restart Splunk) or by command line ($SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk restart))

NOTE: There have been issues with installing this TA via a deployment server. It is recommended that this TA be installed directly and not via a deployment server. Solutions are being researched.
CONFIGURATION
These items should be configured in order for this TA to function properly:

URL of Nessus API
Account Credentials for Nessus API or preferably the API keys (please see Nessus documentation for version 6.4+ on generating keys)
Scan IDs to import (OPTIONAL)
Scheduling (OPTIONAL)

Note: All references to indexer or searchhead are made assuming there is a distributed environment. If Splunk is not configured in a distributed environment and the indexer and searchhead are one device, refer to these references as simply your one Splunk instance.
1. URL of Nessus API

Open a terminal connection to the indexer
Edit the file $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-nessus_json/bin/nessus2splunkjson.py
Find the ""url"" line (number 12) referencing the URL of the Nessus scanner and replace the example with your Nessus host and port

2. Account Credentials for Nessus API

Open a terminal connection to the indexer
Edit the file $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-nessus_json/bin/nessus2splunkjson.py
Find lines 18 and 19 referencing the username and password for an account on the Nessus scanner and replace the examples with an account on the Nessus service. Beginning with Nessus version 6.4, you may use API keys to login instead of hardcoding a username and password for an account into the script, these can be entered on the ""accessKey"" and ""secretKey"" lines (49 and 50, respectively). Please see Nessus documentation for version 6.4+ on how to generate these access keys.

Note: The Nessus account used must have read access to the scans that will be imported via the API. If using a version of Nessus that allows for multiple accounts, the specified account must be explicitly given read access to each scan.
3. Scan IDs to Import (OPTIONAL)
Note: The default configuration will import ALL scans. Follow these steps to limit the scans to only those specified.
Note: The default configuration will import ALL scans. Follow these steps to limit the scans to only those specified.

Open a terminal connection to the indexer
Edit the file $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-nessus_json/bin/getscanID.py
Make the same adjustments to this script for the URL (""url"" on line 12), username (line 18), and password (line 19) that were made in the previous two steps to nessus2splunkjson.py Preferably commencing with Nessus version 6.4, you may use API keys to log in lui of a username and password, these can be entered on lines 14 and 15. Please see Nessus documentation for version 6.4+ on how to generate access keys.
From the terminal, execute $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-nessus_json/bin/getscanID.sh (this will create a file with the name ""getscanID_(timestamp).log"")
Open the newly created file to see a list of detected scan names and associated IDs
Open $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-nessus_json/bin/nessus2splunkjson.py for editing
Copy the desired scan IDs for importing and place them into a comma-separated list on the ""sa"" line (number 27)
Uncomment the ""sa"" line (number 27)
Comment out the ""sa"" line on (line number 242)

4. Scheduling (OPTIONAL)
By default, the script needs to be run manually. To have it execute automatically, see the ScriptSetup page on the Splunk Docs for instructions on how to set this up.
http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/6.2.3/AdvancedDev/ScriptSetup
IMPORTING DATA

Open a terminal connection to the indexer
Execute $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-nessus_json/bin/nessus2splunkjson.sh
Watch in amazement as the script outputs its status
Results of the scan will be written to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-nessus_json/bin/nessus2splunkjson_results_(timestamp).log
If problems are encountered (such as Nessus connection issues), errors will be written to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-nessus_json/bin/nessus2splunkjson_errors_(timestamp).log

Note on Historical IDs: This script keeps track of the historical IDs (in the the hid_history file) that have been processed so that duplication does not occur and subsequent imports are more efficient. All scans that have been specified will be marked for import, including each historical ID within the scan. If the status of the historical ID is running, it will be skipped. All other statuses will attempt to import. However, some aborted and pending scans may not have any host data and thus no data will be imported.
Note on Indexes: This script will import data to the default Splunk index. Changes can be made to this in inputs.conf.
DEFINITIONS

HID = Historical ID is an instance of a specific Nessus scan
PID = Nessus plugin ID
SID = Scan ID is a numerical reference to a Nessus scan name

CONTACT INFO AND FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

Description:

This appis incredibly useful for analyze AlienVault OSSIM information (OSSIM is an OpenSource SIEM), such as AlienVault OSSIM System Events and Alarms. It provides a new way to explore your data, which are already being captured by your AlienVault OSSIM Box. This app is intended to be installed in AlienVault OSSIM Boxes using JailBreak function and allows you to explore and expand the intelligence of the data collected by AlienVault OSSIM, providing a comprehensive set of dashboards, data models and searches in order to improve the managment of your AlienVault OSSIM Box. It also offers the possibility to increase your security intelligence processes and helps the fine tunning of your AlienVault OSSIM box.

Required Apps:

Sideview Utils: http://apps.splunk.com/app/466/
Splunk WebFramework Toolkit: http://apps.splunk.com/app/1613/
timewrap:  http://apps.splunk.com/app/1645/

Prerequisites:

AlienVault or OSSIM Ver 4.x Installation, this app must be on your AlienVault OSSIM installation

Configuration:
* There is two methods for obtain Information as Events or Alarms from OSSIM (Syslog - Action )
First Syslog
In the OSSIM Web Console Go to:
Configuration - Deployment - Components - Servers (Select your server)
Alarms to Syslog *   -- Select Yes
Now all the alarms will be forwarded to the local syslog
We  will create a Filter in Syslog to Moving the Log to another prefered location
The Alarm syslog messages contain the word ""Alienvault:"" so we can create a filter in /etc/rsyslog.conf with the next statement:
    if $rawmsg contains 'Alienvault:' then -/var/log/ossim_alarms.log
    #Stop processing the message after it was written to the log
    & ~
Restart the rsyslog service ""/etc/init.d/rsyslog restart""
And now we are moving all the logs from the Alarms to ""/var/log/ossim_alarms.log"" which will be the location for the datainput in the Splunk OSSIM APP
--Note if you change the destination file you need to change the value in Ossim APP on the  Splunk Data Inputs page.
Second Action 
Other way to export data to a file with OSSIM are the actions, actions allow to do some stuff when an event do match with the conditions described in policies
a Simple script was provided with the app in ""/opt/splunk/etc/apps/ossim/bin/actionlog.sh"" you could used in your actions when create an action, select in type: ""Excute an external program""
On the command Option you could write something like this:
$SPLUNKHOME/etc/apps/ossim/bin/./actionlog.sh """"'""FECHA=DATE ALARMA=SID_NAME RIESGO=RISK SRCIP=SRC_IP:SRC_PORT DSTIP=DST_IP:DST_PORT NOMBRESRC=SRC_IP_HOSTNAME NOMBREDST=DST_IP_HOSTNAME SEN=SENSOR ID=PLUGIN_ID SID=PLUGIN_SID EVID=EVENT_ID USER=USERNAME PASS=PASSWORD DATA1=USERDATA1 DATA2=USERDATA2 DATA3=USERDATA3 DATA4=USERDATA4 DATA5=USERDATA5 DATA6=USERDATA6 DATA7=USERDATA7 DATA8=USERDATA8 DATA9=USERDATA9 BACKLOG=BACKLOG_ID""'""""
The statment above ejecute the script in the OSSIM APP and passes all the data from the event as a variable to create a log in ""/var/log/ossim_action.log""
If you want to change the location of the log, you need to think in the script file and the Data Input on Splunk

Consider LogRotation for your new logs sometimes things can be bigger, in a OSSIM Box you can add Logrotation statements in /etc/logrotate.d/ as file like ossimapp  a sample of the file was provided in ""/opt/splunk/etc/apps/ossim/bin/""
Once we have the correct log fie created and configured, The Ossim APP for Splunk will index all the data and the searches, extractions and reports will work

Note:
Some Extractions are expecting the format descrive above in the actionlog.sh script, also for the Syslog option we are using Ossim ver4.4

Any Extra Information you can contact ossimappforsplunk@a3sec.mx

This app contains nine dashboards, made to compliment the Monitoring Console during maintenance activities involving data sources and the Forwarding tier for pre- and post-validations.
With the exception of the ""Poll Instance"" and ""Data Source Monitoring"" dashboards, all dashboards are portable, allowing their source XML to be copy-and-pasted into a new dashboard on another Splunk instance. (To make a dashboard portable, search and replace the dcm_internal_index macro with index=_internal, and replace the dcm_audit_index macro with index=_audit)
Data Collection Overview dashboard
Shows high-level trends of indexing rates, deployment clients, Splunk Stream forwarders, distinct data source counts, and average data source throughput.
Click the Indexing Rate, Events Per Second, HTTP Event Collector Data Received, Forwarding Splunk Instances, Deployment Clients Phoning Home, Stream Forwarders Phoning Home, Instances Reporting Red/Yellow Data Forwarding Health, or SC4S Sources Forwarding Data values to expand the metric to the timechart below. The Events Per Second timechart contains distinct values over time for Indexes, Sourcetypes, Sources, and Hosts to identify changes to ongoing trends. The Deployment Clients and Stream Forwarders Phoning Home values are the distinct count for the given time span, with a minimum span to compensate for adjusted phone home intervals above default.
Click the Show Filters link on the top to expose the time picker, and to display indexers by instance for smaller deployments, or by site for larger deployments.
Forwarder Troubleshooter dashboard
Reviews internal logs and metrics for troubleshooting common forwarder issues. Check this dashboard when performing maintenance activities on forwarders. Includes forwarder information, throughput metrics, stops and starts, index/sourcetype/source details, health status, resource usage, splunkd logs, deployment server messages, and indexer discovery messages.
Although this dashboard was made primarily for troubleshooting use cases around forwarding, it may also be used to investigate many issues involving both Splunk Enterprise and Universal Forwarder instances. This is as long as their internal logs are forwarding to your indexers, to allow this app to review for issues.
Filter by a single forwarder (Splunk instance) at a time, or a batch of forwarders during maintenance or triage.
Data Source Troubleshooter dashboard
Reviews internal logs and metrics for troubleshooting common data source issues. Check this dashboard when deploying configuration changes to data sources. Includes tstats data over time, as well as detected issues with permissions, enqueuing, timestamp parsing, line breaking, aggregation, future timestamps, and time disparity.
Overlays are added to Tstats Events panels to see distinct values over time for indexes, sourcetypes, sources, and hosts, to help identify changes in ongoing trends.
Tick the Sparklines checkbox in the Tstats Details panel to review individual index, sourcetype, source, and/or host trends beside the other split-by fields. Adding these sparklines may cause these dashboard searches to consume lots of memory -- make sure the Splunk Enterprise instance running this app has a healthy amount of memory available or memory tracker configured properly.
Data Model Troubleshooter dashboard
Reviews REST and tstats data for troubleshooting common data model issues, similar to the Data Source Troubleshooter but for identifying issues with a particular data model. Works best when installed on a search head which includes the underlying data models (i.e. Splunk_SA_CIM) and associated knowledge objects to identify constrained data (i.e. CIM-compliant tags). For example, on the search head hosting the Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) app.
Data Source Monitoring
Reviews events by sourcetype and host over time, optionally monitoring and alerting on anomalies such as missing data. Use this dashboard to review a particular data source for issues such as spikes in data ingestion or outages.
Optionally, visit the Data Source Monitor Configuration dashboard to input sourcetypes and hosts for active monitoring. This feature requires installation of the Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK), alerting on anomalous values by using the DensityFunction algorithm. See the Configuration section for details.
Data Source Outliers
Reviews a particular data source (either a sourcetype or a host) for anomalous values. This dashboard works alongside the Data Source Monitoring dashboard during troubleshooting.
SC4S Metrics dashboard
Reviews Splunk Connect for Syslog (SC4S) indexed fields and metrics for investigating common syslog ingestion issues. Use this dashboard if you have SC4S configured in your deployment, and need to troubleshoot issues related to SC4S syslog collection.
To review data in the metrics panels, the SC4S environment variable ""SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_SC4S_METRICS_HEC"" should be properly configured to forward metrics data. See the SC4S documentation for the Splunk data source.
Deployment Clients dashboard
Reviews REST API data from the Deployment Server(s), extending the information given by Forwarder Management. Includes a similar interface to Forwarder Management, but with the addition of monitoring multiple Deployment Servers, and many filters and extended information of both Deployment Clients and Servers.
This feature is for use wherever the Data Collection Monitor app is installed on-premise, such as on the Monitoring Console or Deployment Server, per Installation instructions. It will not work on the Splunk Cloud Search Head.
Poll Instance dashboard
A bit unique relative to the other dashboards, the Poll Instance dashboard pulls information from a remote Splunk instance for diagnostic information, such as from an unpeered Splunk Enterprise instance or a Universal Forwarder. Use this dashboard to troubleshoot issues such as file inputs not ingesting or to validate current configuration settings.
This dashboard requires configuration before use. See the Installation section below regarding setup remote Splunk credentials.
This feature is for use wherever the Data Collection Monitor app is installed on-premise, such as on the Monitoring Console or Deployment Server, per Installation instructions. It will not work on the Splunk Cloud Search Head.
| pollinstance command
This generator command powers the Poll Instance dashboard, and may be used in your own SPL to query REST API endpoints of Splunk Enterprise and Universal Forwarder instances. This is most useful for instances which are not search peers of this instance, which is a requirement of the ""| rest"" command. To help with compatibility, ""| pollinstance"" also returns a table similar in formatting to ""| rest"".
Syntax:
| pollinstance splunk_host=<string> [splunk_port=<int>] account=<string> object=<string> [uri]


splunk_host  - the host/IP of the target Splunk instance to poll information from
splunk_port  - the management port of the target Splunk instance (optional, default is 8089)
account  - the account name given to the username/password combination, as saved in this app's Configuration dashboard
object  - determines what output to return from the instance; choose one of the following:
rest  - Perform a GET operation from the given REST API endpoint (requires uri to be specified)
all  - Returns information from all the objects listed below
info  - System high-level info
settings  - System high-level settings
messages  - System messages
confs  - Current configuration values
inputstatus  - Input status (tailing processor, exec processor, modular inputs, TCP/UDP)
apps  - Splunk Apps
data  - Data inputs and outputs (TCP cooked/raw, UDP, forward servers)
kvstore  - KV Store
cluster  - Indexer Cluster
shcluster  - Search Head Cluster
deployment  - Deployment Clients
licenser  - License Slaves
search  - Distributed search peers
health  - Splunkd Health
status  - Introspection (CPU/memory/disk utilization, partitions, splunkd processes)



Examples:
Poll data from remote Splunk instance ""splunk.mycorp.com"" REST endpoint ""/services/server/status"", using credentials from account ""Main_IDXC"":
| pollinstance splunk_host=""splunk.mycorp.com"" account=""Main_IDXC"" object=""rest"" /services/server/status

Poll all objects from remote Splunk instance ""10.50.1.22"" on non-standard port ""8091"", using credentials from account ""Tampa_UFs"":
| pollinstance splunk_host=""10.50.1.22"" splunk_port=8091 account=""Tampa_UFs"" object=""all""

Installation
In a Splunk On-Premise Deployment, install this app on a search head, preferably on the Splunk Enterprise instance hosting the Monitoring Console configured in distributed mode. App will not fully function without peering with the Indexing tier and Deployment Server.
In a Splunk Cloud Deployment, install this app both on the Splunk Cloud search head, as well as on the on-premise Deployment Server. The ""Deployment Client"" and ""Poll Instance"" dashboards located under the ""On-Premises Dashboards"" menu within the app must be used from the on-premise Deployment Server web GUI, while all other dashboards work from within the Splunk Cloud web GUI.
Configuration
If using an index other than the default _internal to collect Splunkd logs and _audit to collect Splunk audit logs, set the dcm_internal_index and dcm_internal_audit macros appropriately.
Data Source Troubleshooter
For usage of the Data Model Troubleshooter dashboard, consider either also installing this app on the search head with the defined data models (i.e. a Splunk Enterprise Security search head), or copying this particular dashboard to that Splunk instance.

For usage of the Data Source Monitoring dashboard's alerting functionality, this app requires installation of the Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) and Python for Scientific Computing (Cloud or Linux, Windows) apps from Splunkbase, in order to check for anomalous event ingestion rates by data source (sourcetype or host). After installing these apps, navigate in the Data Collection Monitor app to Configuration > Data Source Monitor Configuration to tell Splunk which sourcetypes and hosts to monitor for anomalies. These monitored sourcetypes and hosts accept wildcards (*), and may also be configured from this app's appropriately named lookup files.
You have a choice of configuring a monitor for 1hr or 24hr monitoring, which corresponds to the interval which MLTK will be training it's DensityFunction model, as well as how often Splunk checks for related anomalies. Typically, using 1hr for more noisy logs and 24hr for more sporadic logs works best. After configuration, navigate to Search > Reports, and manually execute any ""Baseline Model Gen"" searches where alerts were configured (i.e. if a sourcetype was configured for 24hr monitoring, execute the search ""Events By Sourcetype Per Day - Baseline Model Gen""). This will initially train the MLTK model using 60 days of prior data, after which the ""Model Gen"" searches will run on a schedule to periodically update the model in the future.
Be default, alerts are sent to Splunk's Triggered Alerts, and are also displayed on the bottom of the Data Source Monitoring dashboard. To forward alerts to another location, such as to an e-mail address or to a case management solution such as Alert Manager, edit the Anomaly in Events By X alerts within this app by navigating to Search > Alerts > Edit Alert.
Poll Instance
This feature is for use wherever the Data Collection Monitor app is installed on-premise, such as on the Monitoring Console or Deployment Server, per Installation instructions. It will not work on the Splunk Cloud Search Head.
For usage of the Poll Instance dashboard and | pollinstance command, the Splunk instance hosting this app must have the admin credentials of the remote Splunk instance stored locally, as well as IP connectivity to the remote Splunk instance's management port (default TCP/8089). Use the associated Configuration dashboard within this app to add the remote Splunk instance's admin credentials into the encrypted storage passwords service, saved as an Account. Save one Account for each username/password combination used with the Poll Instance dashboard or | pollinstance command, then poll the remote instances as necessary (useful during troubleshooting for information not provided by internal logs). See Splunk docs on how to modify admin credentials on your remote Splunk Enterprise and Universal Forwarder instances.

Search hash, domain, and ip information from VirusTotal, ThreatCrowd, TotalHash, PassiveTotal, and Censys.io
This app uses the public/free versions of the above API providers.
Some results are truncated to 20 items due to the potential for thousands of items returned.
API Providers
Hash Search
•    VirusTotal
•    ThreatCrowd
•    TotalHash
Domain Search
•   PassiveTotal
•   Censys.io
•   VirusTotal
•   ThreatCrowd
•   TotalHash
IP Search
•   PassiveTotal
•   Censys.io
•   VirusTotal
•   ThreatCrowd
•   TotalHash
Setup
In order to use some of the API providers in this App, you must create a directory called local in the app's home path and create a file called api_keys.conf in the local directory.
ThreatCrowd is the only API provider that does not require an API key, see each providers website for obtaining an API credentials.
There is an example api_keys.conf in the default directory. You can simply copy that file into local and place your api credentials in it.
Below is an example as to how to create your api_keys.conf
$ cd /opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-security/
$ mkdir local
$ cp default/api_keys.conf local/
$ vi local/api_keys.conf
Enter your API Credentials
Obtain API Credentials
You can obtain API credentials for the API Providers at the following links
VirusTotal: https://www.virustotal.com/en/
TotalHash: https://totalhash.cymru.com/contact-us/
PassiveTotal: https://www.passivetotal.org/registration
Censys.io: https://censys.io/register
Using Dashboards
You can search All or some of the API providers by clicking checkboxes on the Hash Lookup, Domain Lookup, or IP Lookup views
If you do not click a checkbox, that API provider is NOT contacted with the query, and the subsequent panel is not generated
Steps:

Enter searchitem
Select API providers
Click Submit

Notes:
•   TotalHash requires a SHA1 hash
•   ThreatCrowd does not require an API key

Who is this app for?
This app is for anyone who wants to display several metrics on a small area of a dashboard.
How does the app work?
This app provides a visualization that you can use in your own apps and dashboards.
To use it in your dashboards, simply install the app, and create a search that provides the values you want to display.
Usecases for the Heat Map Visualization:

Displaying server metrics like CPU, Memory, I/O, and Disk usage over time
Comparing sales volume by category over time
Showing related application metrics in a discreet dashboard panel
Highlighting any metrics relative to other entities

The following fields can be used in the search:
 - _time (required): The easiest way to construct a search is to use the | timechart command, with a by clause.
 - category fields (required): Each field name will become a label on the side, with the values being used to set the color based on thresholds. The order of the fields determines the order shown in the viz.
Example Search
| gentimes start=-7 increment=4h 
| eval ""Server Availability""=random()%100, ""Customer Satisfaction""=random()%100,""Server Performance""=random()%100, _time=starttime
| table _time, ""Server Availability"",""Customer Satisfaction"",""Server Performance""
Tokens
Tokens are generated each time you click a cell. This can be useful if you want to populate another panel on the dashboard with a custom search, or link to a new dashboard with the tokens carrying across.

Value: This is the numeric field for the cell you clicked. Default value: $hm_token_value$
Label: This is the field name for the cell you clicked. Default value: $hm_token_label$
Time: This is the '_time' field for the selection. Default value: $hm_token_time$

Save to Desktop

The Slack Add-on for Splunk uses the Slack Audit Logs API to fetch Slack Enterprise Grid Audit Logs into Splunk.

Getting Started
The Audit Logs API is for monitoring the audit events happening in an Enterprise Grid organization to ensure continued compliance, to safeguard against any inappropriate system access, and to allow you to audit suspicious behavior within your enterprise.
The idea is to give Enterprise Grid organization owners the ability to query user actions in a workspace. With this API, you could:

Automatically feed Slack access data into an SIEM or other auditing tool
Proactively monitor for potential security issues or malicious access attempts
Write custom apps to gain insight into how your organization uses Slack

Learn more about Monitoring with the Audit Logs API
Installation and Configuration Steps
This application can be installed an On-Prem or Cloud deployments of Splunk.
Installation Steps for on-prem
Install the TA on one of the Heavy Forwarder(s). Ensure to copy over eventtypes.conf, props.conf and tags.conf over to your search head to make sure field aliases, event types and tags for data model mapping comes through.
Installation Steps for cloud
Create a support ticket with APP-CERT reference to get the app installed on a Cloud instance OR follow the cloud-ops recommended set of actions to install non-published applications.
Configuration steps
The configuration steps are common for on-prem and cloud. Please follow the following steps in order:
1. Open the Web UI for the Heavy Forwarder (or IDM).
2. Navigate to the Splunk Add on for Slack from the Manage Apps Section. Be sure not to configure the inputs from the Data Inputs section of Splunk, as this could lead to some unexpected failures.
3. Navigate to the Configuration page of the Add-on and click on the Add button.
4. Enter a name in the Slack Account name textbox. 
5. Click on the Add to Slack button to generate your Access Token, beginning with xoxp (with scope auditlogs:read). Follow the instructions below to generate this. If you brought your own, paste the Access Token here.
6. Click on Add to save this configuration.
7. Navigate to the Inputs tab.
8. Click on Create New Input button on the top right corner.
9. Enter the following details:
  - Name (required): Provide a unique name for the input.
  - Interval (required): Provide a number in seconds for the query interval.
  - Index (required): Select the index from the dropdown list. Set the default index to be slack_audit, if using in conjuction with the Slack Audit App for Splunk.
  - Start Time (required): Enter the time from which to begin querying, in the format yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss. The default has been set to 2018-01-01 00:00:00.
  - Enterprise Slack Account (required): Select the Account configured on Step 6.
10. Click on Add to save the input.
11. To check for any logs or errors, navigate to the Search tab and enter the below search index=_internal  source=""*ta_slack_add_on_for_splunk_*.log"".
Access Token Generation - Authentication Step

Click on the Add to Slack button to initiate the Authentication flow.
Sign into your organization's Enterprise Grid Slack account from the Sign in page. Please note : Audit logs can only be retrieved by the org owner in a Slack Enterprise account.
You will be presented with a screen to authorize the Slack Audit API App to collect the audit log information from your Enterprise Grid account. Click on Content and info about you and the Administer Slack for your organization options to see what the app can view. Should you see this screen, skip step 4 and proceed onto 5.
If you are not presented with the content in Step 3, close the dialog box and re-initiate the authentication process from Step 1.
Click on Allow to generate your access token.
The access token should now be generated. On the Access Token Generated page, click on the Copy Access Token button to copy the token to your clipboard and close the pop up window.
Manually paste the Access token into the Access Token text box of your Input configuration page. 
The Access token should be about 79-80 characters long. If the character length of the pasted token isn't roughly the same size, re-initiate the authentication process to generate the token from Step 1.

Pre-requisites, FAQ and Troubleshooting

Initially, the sheer volume of audit logs could be large. 
The checkpoints used in the add-on reside in the KV store. Ensure sufficient permissions and access to the KV Store.
If a run of the add-on stopped for any reason, a checkpoint for each input will be stored, with the name ending with _last_accessed_url. This is an indication of an error that must have occurred in the previous run. The input can be restarted (Disable the input first and then enable it) after the cause of failure has been fixed, so it picks up the run from the recorded last successful run.
If using in conjuction with the Slack Audit App for Splunk, ensure the target index is configured as slack_audit, so that the dashboards on the app populate automatically.
Ensure not to configure the inputs from the Data Inputs section of Splunk, as this could lead to some unexpected failures.
If you observe that the field extraction of _time does not match the field date_create, ensure to add an additional line in props.conf under the slack:audit stanza like shown below and deploy it to all indexers.

Deploy Splunk quickly for real-time collection, indexing, analysis and visualizations and then reliably forward events to Hadoop for long-term archiving and additional batch analytics. You can further leverage Splunk by importing data already stored in Hadoop. This makes it easy to stand up reliable, secure, enterprise-grade big data projects in days instead of months.
Splunk Hadoop Connect includes three core features:

Export events to Hadoop - Use Splunk to collect and index massive streams of machine data in real-time. Then send all or a subset of events in a reliable and predictable way to HDFS for archiving, further processing or additional batch analytics. You can choose to pre-process data in Splunk before exporting the results into Hadoop, selecting both the format type as well as specific fields to include. Alternatively, you can simply export raw events. 
Explore Hadoop directories and files - Browse, navigate and inspect HDFS directories and files from the Splunk Hadoop Connect user interface before deciding to import them into Splunk. 
Import and Index Hadoop data into Splunk - Import and index Hadoop data into Splunk to make it available for searching, reporting, analysis and visualizations and provide role-based access controls protection. Gain rapid insight and analysis without writing MapReduce code.

Because it is difficult to point out every SQL pattern that may be used, another method suggested by Monzy Merza is to use standard deviations that are 2.5 times greater than the average length of your URI Query Field. The sqlinjection_stats(sourcetype, uri query field) macro is used to detect this.

Overview:
Optiv_TA_Decept is a Splunk App that monitors for unauthorized and/or malicious activity on your organization’s network. By placing several honeypots that listen on many ports at strategic locations, we can detect early stage attacks. The app can provide increased visibility to potentially malicious activity going on in the organization.
Features:

Listen on several common tcp ports and report unauthorized activity to the app.
Capture keystrokes and network traffic from potentially malicious hosts.
Search and visualization features.
Low system requirements and easy install.
Integration with Splunk Enterprise Security – Intrusion Center
Integration with Optiv Threat Intel - https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2837/

Optiv Decept System is the app, installed on the search head(s), which visualizes the data collected. Optiv_TA_decept is the honeypot which is installed on a standalone honeypot server that listens for network traffic. Both apps are required.
Optiv_TA_Decept Prerequisites:

Linux Operating System
Splunk Enterprise 6.4.x or 6.5.x
Install this app on a standalone system that serves no other function or business purpose. If other apps are installed that the organization uses, the false positive rate may increase.
Place one or more of the app in strategic network zones or aggregation points. Examples: Corporate data center, PCI zone, DMZ

System requirements:

2 CPU cores
2GB RAM
20GB hard drive
Full Splunk Enterprise instance (not universal forwarder).
Operating systems tested: 
Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS 64 bit
CentOS 6.7 64bit
CentOS 7 64 bit
Disable iptables or firewalld, or open the ports used by the app.
Running Splunk as root versus non-root:
Root will monitor privileged ports below 1024, including: SSH, telnet, http, and many others
Non root will only monitor ports above 1024.

Install – Honeypot:

Login to Splunk as an administrator.
Go to Apps->Manage apps
Click Install app from file.
Browse to the file folder with the Optiv_TA_decept file.
Choose the file and click OK
Browse to /opt/splunk/etc/apps/optiv_TA_decept/default
Edit the inputs.conf using a text editor

Uncomment out the stanza that says disabled=false as shown below:

Splunk platform component
Supported
Required
Comments




Search Heads
Yes
Yes
This add-on contains search-time knowledge. It is recommended to turn visibility off on your search heads to prevent data duplication errors that can result from running inputs on your search heads instead of (or in addition to) on your data collection node.


Heavy Forwarders
Yes
No (but recommended)
It is recommended to install this add-on on a heavy forwarder for data collection.  Data collection should be configured in only 1 place to avoid duplicates.


Indexers
Yes
No
Not required as the parsing operations occur on the forwarders.


Universal Forwarders
No
No
Universal forwarders are not supported for data collection because the modular inputs require Python and the Splunk REST handler.



Upgrading
Upgrades of the same major version are supported.  For example, upgrading from version 2.0.0 to 2.1.0 will work.  However, upgrading from version 2.x to 3.x will not work and will cause errors.
Configuration
Ensure the prerequisites are met above.

Most inputs require an Azure AD application registration.  Refer to the in-app documentation for details on setting this up.

Diagnostics Generation
If a support representative asks for it, a support diagnostic file can be generated. Use the following command to generate the file. Send the resulting file to support.
$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk diag --collect=app:sentinelone_app_for_splunk
This file should be collected on the node/instance that is presenting with an issue. If a Heavy Forwarder is being used for inputs, but no data is being collected, perform the command on the Heavy Forwarder. If the alert actions or search commands are not working, run the diagnostic on the Search Head(s) in question.
Troubleshooting
This section provides some tips for troubleshooting the SentinelOne application.




Enable debug logging for modular inputs, alert actions, and custom commands


Copy default/log.cfg to local/log.cfg. Edit local/log.cfg and change the logging level for each component to DEBUG to get debugging messages


Specific logging names can be found using index=_internal action=logger_name


Examples
[sentinelone_app_for_splunk] modularinput=DEBUG restclient=DEBUG utilities=DEBUG kenny_loggins=WARN sentinelone=DEBUG s1_client=DEBUG sentinelone-threat-control=DEBUG sentinelone-network-control=DEBUG sentinelone_cmd_threat_action=DEBUG








Application Configuration




If nothing appears under the Application Configuration header on the application configuration dashboard you can check for web page errors


Firefox: Tools, Web Developer, Web Developer Tools. Errors will display in the console tab


Chrome: Customize and control Google option (right hand corner of the address bar), More Tools, Developer Tools












Helpful searches


SentinelOne creates several log files that reside in $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log. These are indexed in to the Splunk environment in the _internal index. To view these log files you can run the following search:

index=_internal source=""*sentinelone*""



The base index contains a sourcetype sentinelone:error that contains error information from the modular input and alert actions. This search will retrieve these logs:

eventtype=sentinelone_base_index sourcetype=""*error*""







Common Issues


Some of the common issues include:


Proxy Error. Check that the proxy settings are correct.

index=_internal source=""*sentinelone*"" ProxyError





Installation and Configuration

Configuration
Legacy Data
This extension introduces new sourcetypes that are more inline with best practices. If the extension is being upgraded from an exisiting version of the SentinelOne app, these instructions can be followed to allow overlap of the data sources. Each of the different sourcetype will follow the same procedure to enable searching on the old data, concurrent with the new data.
The steps are as follows, and should be done in local/eventtypes.conf:

Update and enable the legacy index event type sentinelone_legacy_index with the index that contains the legacy data.

Agents


Update and enable the sentinelone_legacy_agents event type.




Add sentinelone_legacy_agents to the sentinelone_agents event type

eventtype IN (sentinelone_updated_agents, sentinelone_legacy_agents)





Threats


Update and enable the sentinelone_legacy_threats event type.




Add sentinelone_legacy_threats to the sentinelone_threats event type

eventtype IN (sentinelone_updated_threats, sentinelone_legacy_threats)





Activities


Update and enable the sentinelone_legacy_activities event type.




Add sentinelone_legacy_activities to the sentinelone_activities event type

eventtype IN (sentinelone_updated_activities, sentinelone_legacy_activities)





Groups


Update and enable the sentinelone_legacy_groups event type.




Add sentinelone_legacy_groups to the sentinelone_groups event type

eventtype IN (sentinelone_updated_groups, sentinelone_legacy_groups)

Welcome to this rather exciting version increment. I am personally very excited about v1.2 and I hope you will be too.
There is a demo version online too at http://www.binaryarp.com:8080 user=web password=web
What's different:

Documentation, Documentation and more Documentation. Its all in the README
No more inline searches, everything is based on savedSearches
Common Information Model adoption
Easier navigation
Modualised approach for easier modification. Think of the PCI app as a collection of smaller apps, making it easy to lift the module and just run with that as a seperate app.

Modules within v1.2 include:

Auditors Overview 
Risk Register (excel csv based input)
Vulnerability Scanning (Nexpose only by csv file, nessus to follow in v1.2.1)
Firewall (IPTables, Toplayer, PIX)
File Integrity Monitoring (Aide)
Webserver (apache)

Modules planned in v1.3
Core Updates

Common Information Model based searching
Updated for v2 of the PCI-DSS standard
Configurator Page - simplified deployment model

Module Additions/Updates

Juniper SA SSL VPN to be included in the VPN Module
Juniper firewall to be included in the Firewall Module
Improved Toplayer searches in the Firewall Module with event lookups
Code Review Module with built in workflows
Trouble ticketing - should it stay, should it go?
Improved in-application help

Documentation for the app and its modualised approach is available here, and this is where you will find information on how to tag your data to get the most from the app.
It is key to note that the new PCI standard will be available in October. I plan to have a revision of the app out onto splunkbase for the end of October with the latest PCI version detailed included. This release, which will be v1.2.2 will include any modifications required for the latest standard.

Troubleshooting


To troubleshoot Flashpoint Intelligence Addon, check \$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/ta_flashpoint_intelligence_flashpoint_intelligence.log file.


User can also search for ERROR logs in the Splunk using this query index=""_internal"" source=**ta_flashpoint_intelligence_flashpoint_intelligence.log** ERROR


As the input configuration settings have been changed in the newer version of the Add-on, if a user has enabled any inputs which were created in the older version of Flashpoint App(versions prior to 1.1.1), then the app will throw an error in the Splunk Message box as:
""Found an unsupported input <input_name> from the older version of Flashpoint. Please recreate this input with the new configurations to continue fetching data.""
   To resolve this error, the user would have to delete all the inputs that were created prior to 1.1.1 and create them again in the latest version to start fetching the data.


User can also search for the same error in the Splunk using this query
index=""_internal"" source=**ta_flashpoint_intelligence_flashpoint_intelligence.log** ERROR Found an unsupported input

Bring BitSight Security Ratings observation information into your security program through this integration with Splunk Enterprise and Enterprise Security. BitSight Security Performance Management for Splunk automates the integration of BitSight observations into Splunk for correlation, analysis, and action. This includes observations from BitSight Work From Home Remote Office which helps organizations understand the risk environment in remote offices that lack many of the traditional security controls.
The add-on automatically maps the BitSight observation types to Splunk’s Common Information Model to enable relevant workflows based on the events from the BitSight data. The BitSight observations are summarized in a dashboard within the add-on. 
This visibility enables you to integrate BitSight data with security data from other systems processed by Splunk to identify risk and accelerate remediation. BitSight data can help pinpoint the sources of infections and risky configurations in your company infrastructure, seamlessly going from awareness to rapid remediation. The additional visibility and integration allow security and IT teams  to respond faster and more effectively to threats.
BitSight Work from Home - Remote Office - 
BitSight Work from Home - Remote Office helps security teams identify vulnerabilities and infections on IP addresses known to be associated with remote operating environments.  BitSight Security Performance Management for Splunk leverages the Network Sessions data model to quickly identify home office IP addresses using available log sources in Splunk like VPNs logs. Those IPs are then used to gather security risk observations from BitSight. These observations can be used to:

Discover security issues that reside on work from home IPs to help inform existing incident response or insider threat activities. 
Monitor higher risk remote operating environments such as access to sensitive data or intellectual property (e.     Exes, software devs)
Educate employees on potential security issues as part of security training & awareness programs

This add-on is compatible with both Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Enterprise Security.
