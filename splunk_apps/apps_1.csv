Background: 
The sar command (System Activity Reporter) on Solaris generates overall system performance reports from Solaris servers.  The sar command has an option -A that reports on the overall system performance. If you enable the cron command sa2 and run a collection with multiple iterations throughout the day, it will create reports in the following location: /var/adm/sa/sardd , where dd is the day the report has collected metrics for. 
What This TA Collects:
This TA will collect those sardd reports the day after they are generated by the sar -A / sa2 command. It will run a scripted input (s2s.sh) against them and create a temporary file that a Splunk monitor input will be looking for. This was done instead of directly sending the output to Splunk due to their potential size.
What This TA Produces In Splunk:
In Splunk, this TA will create metrics tagged with the following sourcetypes for all of the data collected. These sourcetypes map to all of the sar tasks collected via sar -A . 
sar:cpu_util
sar:disk_activity
sar:queue_activity
sar:buffer_activity
sar:swap_activity
sar:system_call_stats
sar:file_access
sar:terminal_activity
sar:system_table_status
sar:interproc_comm
sar:page-in_activity
sar:page-out_and_mem
sar:unused_mem
sar:kernel_mem_alloc
If you want a reference to what info is collected, you can see them here: 
http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/821-1451/enudq.html#scrolltoc
Directions for Setup:
I. ON THE SEARCH HEAD:

Install the TA. Unzip/Untar it in the $SPLUNK_HOME/apps/ folder

II. ON THE INDEXER:

Install the TA. Unzip/Untar it in the $SPLUNK_HOME/apps/ folder

III. ON THE SOLARIS FORWARDER:


Install the TA on the Solaris server forwarder. Unzip/Untar it in the $SPLUNK_HOME/apps/ folder


In the TA_sar_daily_report/bin directory, you MUST modify the settings in the configuration.sh file (and the s2s-backfill.sh file if doing backfill) to customize the collection to your environment


Copy the inputs.conf file from the TA_sar_daily_report/default directory and place in TA_sar_daily_report/local directory. Modify the inputs.conf file in the TA_sar_daily_report/local directory to enable the inputs to collect and adjust collection times as needed. 


a) FOR NORMAL OPERATION ENABLE BOTH s2s.sh script and SAR-TEMP monitor
b) FOR HISTORICAL BACKFILL OPERATION - ENABLE BOTH s2s-backfill.sh script and SAR-BACKFILL monitor
c) TO REMOVE SAR-TEMP AND SAR-BACKFILL DIRECTORIES AND FILES - ENABLE the s2s-removal.sh script

This package contains parsing logic, saved searches, and dashboards for monitoring the OSSEC Host-based Intrusion Detection System via Splunk.
Please read the Installation section below - the app will not work correctly without configuration.
Some functionality, primarily agent management, is not currently supported when Splunk is running on Windows.
Installation

To install, extract the .tgz archive in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps
You may need to enable the appropriate inputs, either via inputs.conf, or through the Manager in the Splunk GUI.
The application maintains a list of all known OSSEC servers in a lookup table. When you first install, this list will be empty except for a wildcard ntry. You can wait until it is populated automatically, or run OSSEC - Rebuild OSSEC Server Lookup Table from the Searches & Reports -> Utility menu.
Upgrading

This version introduces a number of changes, particularly from version 1.0 (see the CHANGES file). The recommended procedure is to remove the old app before installing. Installing over top of older versions should (mostly) work, but may cause some problems.
Data Inputs

Sample input declarations are included with the application, but are disabled by default. These may be enabled either in inputs.conf, or via the Manager.
Several data input methods are available:  

Native syslog daemon, writing to flat files which are indexed by Splunk.
Syslog-style input directly to Splunk
Direct monitoring of OSSEC alert logs. Typically requires Splunk to be installed on the OSSEC server.
Scripted input to periodically check the status of OSSEC agents by running ossec_agent_control -l, either locally or on a remote system.

For options (1) and (2), set the sourcetype to 'ossec'.
For option (3), set the sourcetype to 'ossec_alerts'.
For option (4), set the sourcetype to 'ossec_agent_control'.
Collection of OSSEC agent Operational Status:

To collect OSSEC agent status, you will need to be able run the agent_control command without a password.
For local OSSEC servers using the default path, this is configured by default. For non-standard install paths, you will need to edit ossec_servers.conf.
For remote execution, see below.
Managing Agent Keys from Splunk

To enable key management, you will need to be able to run the manage_agents command without a password. You will also need to be a member of either the Splunk Admin role or the OSSEC Admin role.
This feature is not enabled by default for security reasons. You can enable it by editing ossec_servers.conf.
For remote execution, see below.
Enabling Remote Execution

For remote agent status collection and remote management, you can use SSH and sudo to avoid password prompts.
The Splunk service account (root by default) will need to be able to log into the OSSEC server as a user with permissions to run the following commands without being prompted for a password:
agent_control -l
manage_agents
For more detailed instructions, consult Splunk Answers:
http://splunk-base.splunk.com/answers/42717/how-do-i-enable-remote-agent-management-in-splunk-for-ossec
Agent Coverage Tracking

At present, the agent coverage dashboard currently relies on agent status information from the agent_control command (see above). A Splunk Enterprise license is needed for the scheduled searches.
To use agent coverage tracking, you must populate a lookup table that tracks all hosts that should be monitored by OSSEC. By default, all hosts seen by Splunk in the last 30 days will be expected.
Edit the saved search OSSEC - Track Expected Hosts to configure your own list. For example, all servers or all members of a particular LDAP container.
Malware Alerting

Alerting on malware file hashes only works when Splunk is directly monitoring the ossec alerts log (Syslog-based logging does not include the hashes).
If you are using this method, you can configure your email address and enable the alert from the Manager.
The MD5 and SHA1 file hashes will be sent to a third party (Team Cymru) for validation.
No guarantees of accuracy are provided.

This tool has an embeded documentation located after installation in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/utbox/appserver/static/documentation.pdf
What is what ?
The syntax of a URL is as follow:
scheme://[user:password@]domain:port/path?query_string#fragment_id
Component details:

The scheme, which in many cases is the name of a protocol (but not always), defines how the resource will be obtained. Examples include http, https, ftp, file and many others. 
The domain name or literal numeric IP address gives the destination location for the URL.
The port number, given in decimal, is optional; if omitted, the default for the scheme is used (80 for http, 443 for https, etc).
The path is used to specify and perhaps find the resource requested. 
The query string contains data to be passed to software running on the server. It may contain name/value pairs separated by ampersands, for example ?first_name=John&last_name=Doe.
The fragment identifier, if present, specifies a part or a position within the overall resource or document. When used with HTML, it usually specifies a section or location within the page, and used in combination with Anchor elements or the ""id"" attribute of an element, the browser is scrolled to display that part of the page.

List of provided Lookups
For more information, please refer to the embeded documentation.

ut_parse_simple(url)

ut_countset(word, set)
ut_suites(word, sets)
ut_meaning(word)
ut_bayesian(word)

Lookup & Macros
A generic lookup call in Splunk is of the format:
... | lookup <lookup_name> field AS field 
For example:
... | lookup ut_parse_simple_lookup url AS cs_uri
UTBox also provides macros definition for each lookup to make it easier to call the lookups. In the previous example, the call would be:
... | `ut_parse_simple(cs_uri)`
It is important to understand that those macros are simply shortcuts to lookups call. One can use one or another depending on their tastes.
History

v1.6, April 2016
new feature: the list parameter now accept a star (*) to load all lists (Mozilla, IANA, and Custom) in order to return the longest matching TLD.
Thanks to @davelugo for the idea!


v1.5, December 2015 Important changes
new feature: users can choose which list of TLD to load (2 provided by default, Mozilla Suffix List and IANA List)
ut_parse_extended requires now 2 arguments (url to parse and the list to use, ‘mozilla’, ‘iana' or 'custom')
ut_parse, mapped to  ut_parse_extended requires the same.

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5293,2022-01-10,07:17:59 AM,ThrowAway - Automated Retention Management of Archives,,"Oct. 14, 2020","Introduction
This is a custom add-on that aims to give the Splunk Enterprise administrators control over the files on the local storage of Splunk Enterprise instances. The app can search for files/directories based on RegEx patterns and can remove them based on aging criteria.
Deployment
The app is available in SPL and TAR bundles and these can be deployed quite easily through the GUI of single instance Splunk Enterprise installations. For distributed instances read below.
Non-clustered distributed environment
For non-clustered environments it is a matter of adding the un-archived bundle directory to the ""deployment-apps"" in the Deployment Server (DS) of the environment, followed by adding a server class mapping, either through the GUI of the DS or through editing the ""serverclass.conf"" file.
Clustered distributed environment
For environments with Indexer clustering the add-on should be first sent to the Cluster Master (CM) and then distributed via bundle replication to the Indexers/Peers. Every consequent configuration of the app should be performed via the CM. This will ensure that configuration changes are pushed to the peers gracefully and they are restarted one by one, without losing service availability.
Configuration scenarios
Example1 - Configure frozen bucket housekeeping
Housekeeping is performed on an index-level using the file/directory removal tool ""TA-throw-away"". You need to configure new stanza for every new index that is configured to keep data in frozen state for a certain time period. In case of distributed environment with indexer cluster you should perform this directly on the Cluster Master in order to deploy the configurations to all the cluster members.

Login to your Cluster Master (for indexer cluster) or your Indexer (for non-clustered indexers) with your SSH client.
Create/Edit the ""inputs.conf"" file in your ""TA-throw-away"" add-on:

sudo vi /opt/splunk/etc/master-apps/TA-throw-away/local/inputs.conf

Use the template below to add a new housekeeping stanza in the ""inputs.conf"" file of the ""TA-throw-away"" for your index, e.g. for index ""splunk_index"":

[remove_files_directories://splunk_index]
index = _audit
interval = 86400
pattern = (d|r)b\d{10,11}\d{10,11}.*
retention_policy = 1
retention_period = 32832000
timestamp_location = name
working_directory = /data1/frozen/splunk_index/frozendb/
disabled = 0_  

Save the file.
For clustered indexers go back to the GUI of the Cluster Master, in the ""Indexer Clustering"" menu. 
Choose ""Edit"" → ""Configuration Bundle Actions"". 
Press the ""Validate and Check Restart"" button and wait for the process to finish. 
Next, you need to press the ""Push"" button and wait the package to be deployed to each peer (might also perform automatic rolling restart).
After completing the restart, you can perform a search in the ""_audit"" index for events that point to directories being removed (if objects from the index frozen directory qualify).  


There's a known bug in Splunk, which prevents custom Python libraries to be loaded unless they are placed under ""$SPLUNK_HOME$/etc/apps/"". This will cause issues for ""TA-throw-away"" in clustered indexers. To alleviate the problem, you must access every indexer in the cluster through SSH client and create a symbolic link like below:
sudo ln -s /opt/splunk/etc/slave-apps/TA-throw-away/ /opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-throw-away

Example2 - Adding new cluster members
In order for the ""TA-throw-away"" add-on to work properly, you need to deploy it from the cluster master (which will happen automatically  when you add a cluster member to the cluster). Then you also need to address a known limitation in Splunk, which is Splunk does not look for custom python code if the application that contains it is installed under anything different than ""$SPLUNK_HOME$/etc/apps/"". This is exactly what happens when the custom add-on is deployed from the Cluster Master - it ends up installed under ""$SPLUNK_HOME$/etc/slave-apps"". To work around this issue you should create a symbolic link under ""$SPLUNK_HOME$/etc/apps"" that points to the app in ""$SPLUNK_HOME$/etc/slave-apps"", e.g.:
sudo ln -s /opt/splunk/etc/slave-apps/TA-throw-away/ /opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-throw-away
Configuration details
The snippet below shows complete documentation (please, read it carefully!) on the parameters used in the ""inputs.conf"" file:  
#Replace all {vars} with your own and read the description carefully! Data will be deleted from disk!!!
#
#First is the stanza definition
#[remove_files_directories://{name_of_input}]
#
#Then configure the index, where events will be sent for storage. These events are holding the names of files/directories that were deleted.
#index = {name_of_index}
#
#The following parameter sets the frequency with which the input will be executed. Measured in seconds.
#interval = 86400
#
#Use ordinary RegEx pattern in the following parameter in order to select only matching files/directories for removal.
#E.g. (d|r)b_\d{10,11}_\d{10,11}_.* for Splunk index buckets.
#pattern = {RegEx}
#
#The next parameter will be used in order to remove files/directories based on their age. ""1"" means ""enabled"".
#retention_policy = 1
#
#The retention period is measured in seconds. It will be used in order to tell what is the maximum age of files/directories.
#Files/directories that are older than the maximum will be removed. E.g. if set to ""86400"" (these are seconds) this means that
#if the file/directory is older than 24 hours it will be qualified for removal.
#retention_period = 3600
#
#Timestamp location can be found in the name (in case of Splunk index buckets) or in the file/directory ""last modified"" attribute.
#Set to ""name"" if you would like to work with bucket names, or ""last_modified"" if you'd like to use the attribute of the file.
#timestamp_location = name
#
#Finally, provide the absolute path where you wish the input to look for files/directories. If you are using Splunk index buckets,
#make sure you provide the location to the frozendb directory for the particular index. Otherwise you might remove stuff which is currently being used…
#E.g. /opt/splunk/var/lib/splunk/defaultdb/frozendb/ for deleting frozen buckets from the ""main"" index. Path should always end with ""/""!
#working_directory = {absolute_path}
#
#Use ""1"" if you wish to disable the input
#disabled = 0",Version 1.0.4,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/59192b3a-0de2-11eb-9789-06add55d78f8.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance, Utilities",https://www.bright.consulting/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Bright-Splunk-App-End-User-License-Agreement.pdf,120,0,splunk,0,0,Bright Consulting Jsc,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/brightconsulting,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4322,2022-01-10,07:18:26 AM,PyDen,,"June 11, 2020","Overview
The goal of this application is to provide full Python functionality to Splunk. Currently, the Python distribution built in to Splunk runs on a version 2.7.x depending on the Splunk version. Additionally, there are significant core modules that are excluded in this distribution. This suite of apps will allow developers to create Python virtual environments and pick the Python version and modules installed to the environment. This includes core distributions of the interpreter in multiple 2.7.x and 3.5+ versions, as well as the use of pip for the installation of additional modules within a virtual environment.
Why PyDen
Introduction
The PyDen app is based on the premise that the Splunk built-in CPython distribution is insufficient for advanced development within the Splunk platform. The key example of this is Splunk's own Machine Learning toolkit (MLTK). The Splunk MLTK requires the installation of an add-on which provides access to the Anaconda Python interpreter and several Python libraries that are common in the community for Machine Learning applications, such as numpy. 
While this is an excellent solution for providing the needed functionality for the MLTK, it's insufficient for generalized use for three reasons. These are the three primary concerns  that PyDen attempts to address: version flexibility, proper isolation, and access to PyPI packages.
Version flexibility
Splunk's built-in Python utilizes version 2.7 of CPython. While there are a decent number of common libraries that are continuing support of 2.7, the number is dwindling and  newer projects do not support it at all. The version will also reach end of life in 2020, causing significant supportability and security issues. The PyDen app allows a developer to build CPython from source in a variety of versions including 3.5 and higher through the use of the createdist command.
Development isolation
Modules added to a Splunk app are available to the entire installation, which is in contrast to Python development best practices which calls for the isolation of package requirements through the use of virtual environments. This isolation of packages resolves issues around dependency conflicts and keeps the scope of libraries to the context of the application. This is done through making Python virtual environments available via PyDen's createvenv command.
Leveraging libraries
Splunk does not allow a developer to add additional packages not included with the built-in distribution except through inclusion within the app directly. Ease of inclusion of third-party libraries is a key benefit of Python. However, including non-native libraries within a Splunk application poses two key challenges: dependency chasing and library conflicts (which we discuss in the next section). In order to include a non-native library within a Splunk app, a developer must include it directly within the app's bin directory. If the package contains any dependencies, those must be added as well. If any of the dependencies have their own dependencies, they must be included as well. And so on, and so on. By creating access to the pip command within Splunk, PyDen does not suffer this problem.
Architecture
PyDen is broken into two separate Splunk apps called: PyDen and PyDen Manager. The PyDen Manager app contains all the functionality needed for a user to download, compile, and build Python distributions and virtual environments, as well as the ability to use pip to install packages to those environments. The actual CPython builds and environments are placed in the PyDen app. The location of the PyDen app can vary depending on the Splunk architecture. 
For a single search head environment the PyDen app can be placed along side the PyDen Manager in the Splunk apps directory. 
In a deployment with multiple search heads, PyDen can be placed onto the deployment server repository location. 
In a deployment utilizing search head clustering, it can be placed into the deployer's shcluster/apps directory. 
In all of these scenarios, PyDen Mnagaer must be installed to the same host as PyDen. The pyden.conf configuration file inside of the PyDen Manager app contains a stanza called app which has a location attribute which should specific the absolute path of the PyDen app. 
Compatibility
The PyDen suite of apps has been tested for compatibility with Splunk 7.2. Use with other version of Splunk are considered experimental and should be tested thoroughly. 
Requirements
The app builds CPython from source and therefore the success of the build is highly dependent on the operating system libraries available. The host OS must have a compiler and the packages needed in order to build Python from source. Please refer to the documentation for your OS for needed packages. Two options are included in the ./configure command during the Python build process: --enable-optimizations (if configured) and --with-ensurepip=install.
Installation and Configuration
Installation of the PyDen Manager follows the same process as any other Splunk app. Please refer to Splunk's documentation on the subject. The PyDen app installation process will vary depending on the Splunk deployment architecture. Please see the Architecture section for details on where to install PyDen. If PyDen is installed to any location other than the Splunk apps directory, the installation process will consist of extracting the app from the gzipped tarball and placing it in the specified directory on the host.
Both PyDen and PyDen Manager need to be installed on the same host. After both apps are installed, the PyDen Manager needs to be configured through the pyden.conf file. This file contains two stanzas: download and app. The download stanza has a single attribute called url which is used to specify the location from where Python is downloaded. It is not recommended to change this location except in the need to app proxy information. If a location other than www.python.org there will be significant gaps in the functionality of the dashboards. The app stanza contains two attributes optimize and location. The location attribute is the absolute path of the location of the PyDen app and the optimize attribute is a boolean which indicates whether or not Python will be built using the --enable-optimizations parameter. Enabling optimizations will provide significant speed improvements but takes significantly longer to build. 
Custom Commands
There are three primary custom commands that make up the core functionality of PyDen: createdist, createvenv, and pip. There are additional suplemental commands that primarily aid in working with the dashboards.
Createdist
The createdist command is how PyDen downloads and builds a CPython distribution. This command contains two keyword arguments version and download. The version argument is simply the version number of the Python installation to be built. The download argument is optional and only used if not doing an automatic download from www.python.org. Instead of being downloaded, the Python source package can be placed inside the PyDen Manager's bin/build directory. When done this way, the download argument should provide the name of the package to be used. Package must be a file of .tgz format.
Note: the first distribution created by this command will be set as the default version used by other commands like createvenv.
Examples:
Download and install version 3.7.2 from www.python.org
| createdist version=3.7.2
Install 3.7.2 version of Python from source package called mypython.tgz
| createdist version=3.7.2 download=mypython.tgz
Createvenv
The createvenv command creates a Python virtual environment with a specified version and name. The command has two required keyword arguments: version and name. The version is a version number that references an installed Python distribution from the createdist command. The name argument is a name to be associated with the environment for future reference.
Note: the first environment created by this command will be set as the default environment used by other commands like pip.
Examples:
Create a virtual environment with Python version 3.7.2 and named mypy
| createvenv version=3.7.2 name=mypy
Pip
The pip command installs Python packages available from the Python Package Index. This command works identically to the command-line tool of the same name with one exception. The command takes a single keyword argument called environment which specifies which virtual environment the command applies to. If used, this must be the first argument listed. If not used, the command will apply to the default virtual environment.
Examples:
Install the package requests to the default environment
| pip install requests
Upgrade the pip version of the environment myvenv
| pip environment=myvenv install --upgrade pip
Additional Commands
The following commands are included in the PyDen Manager app but are of limited value. They're typically used to provide some needed functionality for a dashboard. 
Getversions
This command creates a list of events with a field called version whose values are PyDen compatible versions of Python available from www.python.org.
Example:
| getversions
Pydelete
This command deletes distributions and virtual environments created through the createdist and createvenv commands. The command takes a single positional argument of the name or version number of the environment or distribution to be deleted.
Examples:
Delete the 3.7.2 distribution
| pydelete 3.7.2
Delete the virtual environment named mypy
| pydelete mypy
Getvenvs
This command creates a set of events with a single field called environment whose values are the names of virtual environments created by the createvenv command.
Example:
| getvenvs
Getpackages
The getpackages command is used to get package information from the Python Package Index. There are two modes to this command. The command itself takes a single positional argument. If pypi_simple_index is provided as the argument then the command will create a set of events with a single field called package whose value is the name of a package from PyPI's simple index.
If any other argument is provided, the command will use its other mode which looks up the json data for a PyPI package found at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/package_name/json and returns an event with a single field called description whose value is the PyPI description of the package provided.
Examples:
Get all PyPI packages from the PyPI simple index
| getpackages pypi_simple_index
Get the description for the requests package
| getpackages requests
Using virtual environments
Leveraging the environments in the PyDen app is simply a matter of importing the activation modules provided with PyDen.
PyDen comes with two scripts in its bin directory: activate.py and  activate_default.py. The activate.py script contains a function called activate_venv_or_die. In order to run a script with a PyDen virtual environment, the script must include the following code at the top, substituting your virtual environment name for environment_name:
from activate import activate_venv_or_die
activate_venv_or_die(""environment_name"")
This will utilize Python's os.execve function to restart the script with the provided virtual environment. 
While this will work with any valid virtual environment provided, you may not wish to muddy up your import statements with functions. In order to avoid this problem the activate_default.py script is provided. This script will activate the default virtual environment defined in the PyDen app's pyden.conf configuration file when imported and without the function call. Instead of the above code, simply add the following code to the top of your script:
import activate_default
It is important to note that these two scripts are included in the PyDen app and in order to import them as Python modules, you will need to do one of the following:
- Place the script you are writing in the PyDen bin directory (this is highly discouraged as scripts can be overwritten during an upgrade of the app)
- Modify the sys.path to include the PyDen bin directory before importing the scripts (this may have unintended side effects)
- Copy activate.py and activate_default.py files into the app which contains your script (preferred method)",Version 1.3.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/09825c8a-ab96-11ea-beff-02fa7700cf1c.png,Utilities,https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,869,0,splunk,5,1,Jason Rauen,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/badarsebard,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

Setup
On first run, you will be driven through the setup screen.
You need to provide the IP address of your Home Hub (normally 192.168.1.254) the admin username (which is always ""admin"") and your Admin (not wifi) password.
The password will be written on the ID card of your device unless you have changed it.
The credentials are only used by the ""getLogs.py"" script to login to your router a query for the event list. No changes are made to the HH, and the credentials are not sent anywhere else.
Dashboard
The App dashboard shows an overview of your device once initial collection has completed (which should only take a few minutes).
The collection of logs will occur periodically to featch any new logs. After a few hours you should see your charts forming.

This supporting add-on provides one command -- ovquery. It is built on Cisco's PSIRT openVuln API and the Splunk SDK (note that this is not an offical product of Cisco).
Command reference:
ovquery
Description
The ovquery queries Cisco's PSIRT openVuln API and generates Splunk events from the results returned. Credentials must be generated and setup before command will work.
The command requires that the specific API filter (get_by) to query is specified (found at https://github.com/CiscoPSIRT/openVulnAPI/tree/master/openVulnQuery#api-filters-required) as well an appropriate query is specified for the filter. Returned by default is all fields of 'advisory_id', 'sir', 'first_published', 'last_updated', 'cves', 'bug_ids', 'cvss_base_score', 'advisory_title', 'publication_url', 'cwe', 'product_names', and 'summary', though you can list only specific fields by providing a comma separated list to the command. The command expects by default a get_by and query option. The query value will depend on what the get_by value is set to.

Purpose
FWNUA (Free Windows Network User Accounting), is a small executable that runs
silently in a Windows logon or logoff script and collects data about a user,
such as username, computer name, ip address, and domain.
FWNUA allows more freedom in standardized Windows computer naming. FWNUA
keeps track of workstations your users log into so you don't have to.
Have you been naming workstations after users?  Users move, they leave the
company or organization, or they upgrade hardware.  Who wants to spend weeks
renaming thousands of computers just to make sense of what people have what
machines?  FWNUA can help!

Data Collection Setup
1 - Create a directory - on your network with high availability. This 
    directory must be readable and writeable by all users who logon to the 
    domain. Though you can hide the share by using a ""$"" at the end of the 
    share name for a somewhat heightened sense security.
2 - FWNUA executable - fwnua.exe should be placed in your NETLOGON directory
    on your domain controller, though it can also be run from any network 
    share.
3 - Insert a command into your main user logon or logoff script, executing
    fwnua.exe. Below is the fwnua.exe usage options:
Usage: fwnua [syslog IP] [udp port] [logon | logoff]

Options:

    logon           The program will record the user as logging on.
                     This argument would be used in a logon script.

    logoff          The program will record the user as logging off.
                     This argument would be used in a logoff script.
                     Logoff scripts are supported natively on
                     Windows 2000 and 2003 domains.

syslog IP   This is the ip address of the syslog server that
        you wish to send your logging to

udp port    This is the UDP port number your syslog server will
        be listening on.  Common syslog server UDP default 
        port is 514.

4 - Test Test Test  Ensure that the syslog server is running on the
            correct port.  Ensure all network firewalls allow
            traffic to your syslog server.  Test on all operating
            systems in your network environment prior to deployment.

Splunk Dashboard Setup
Install the FWNUA app from splunkbase:
 - https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2773/

OR - 

1 - Log into your splunk environment with an admin account
2 - Add a new event type, in the search app context, called ""FWNUA"" and set it's search string
    to ""FWNUA-LOG"".
3 - Add a new view called ""FWNUA"" under the search app context and paste in the xml code from
    the SPLUNK_XML.TXT file packaged with this release.
4.  Set permisons accordingly and enjoy the new dahsboard.

Data Overview
A fundamental aspect of this application to understand is how the data is organized. The FRED® Add-On for Splunk installs a kvstore list called FRED_Default_List. This list is used to store the FRED series ID's for which we want to retrieve data. When the default list is populated initially using the initial setup page in the FRED® Add-On for Splunk and the default list input is configured. The FRED® Add-On for Splunk will begin to download all of the FRED data series in the list. The default data is used to poulate the dashboards in this application.
Index Setup
The index referenced in this app is configured in the mts_econ_indexes macro and is configured to use the index fred_data by default. The installation and configuration instructions for the FRED® Add-On for Splunk recommend creating the fred_data index before configuration. If a different index name was used for the FRED data then update the mts_econ_indexes macro accordingly.
Application Overview
The default page of the application is the economic overview shown below. Each panel displays the latest value and trailing twelve month trend for the FRED series specified. The latest date collected for each series is displayed.

The category menu toggles the value categories and each panel links to the detail drilldown for that category. Each category drill down will contain the high level current values from the over view page. The page will also contain a series comparison line chart which can be modified to include the desired series in the category. The page also has two detail panels which can select any series from the category. These panels show the series information from the list, a timechart, range gauge, and summary statistics. An example category drilldown is shown below.


The default series list can also be used to show detail on any data series. To get to the default list click default-->FRED Default List in the application menu, as shown below.

The default list management view is then displayed, as shown below. The list can be filtered by category and frequency using the dropdown lists.

The series detail dashboard below is shown by clicking on the FredID of any series.

When an index reaches its maximum size, Splunk deletes the oldest indexed events. This can occur whenever an index has not been correctly sized.
Splunk Monitoring Console already provides means to monitor how your indexes are filling up helping you spotting any full or nearly full index.
Therefore, you usually just have to extend the size of a nearly full index to avoid losing data.
However, this task could become redundant if indexes' size are being extended with no regards for the actual volume of data they ingest.
This can be avoided by having your indexes correctly sized.
To correctly size an index, you have to be able to predict what will be its size when it reaches the configured retention period.
To be able to estimate that final size, you obviously need to know how much data this index will ingest every day.
The problem is that it could be difficult to know the average daily volume of data that will receive an index beforehand. This volume can also vary widely over time.
This App provides visibility on your indexes' filling by calculating the final size of each index based on the daily average volume of data ingested, and by comparing it to the current index configuration.
Hence, the goal of this App is to provide a simple way to check on the sizing of your indexes in order to avoid data loss and redundant index re-sizing.

Insight
To check on the daily volume of data ingested by each index, this App uses Discovered Intelligence's Meta Woot! (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2949/)
This later App provides great insights from your Splunk metadata and license usage.
To build its knowledge on your license consumption, it uses a dedicated accelerated Data Model.
The Meta Woot License Usage Data Model aggregates data from your license_usage.log file ingested in the _internal index.
We thought it was more convenient to use this Data Model because we do use Meta Woot and wanted to avoid having to maintain a duplicate data model and also because we are already using this Data Model with our previous App, Internal Billing (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4041/).
Prerequisites
1 - Deploy Meta Woot! (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2949/) on your Splunk Search Head.
2 - Configure acceleration for Meta Woot's License Usage Data Model.
It can be achieved by ticking Accelerate from Settings > Data models > Meta Woot License Usage > Edit > Edit Acceleration and by setting the Summary Range to 7 days.
3 - Configure global permissions for Meta Woot's License Usage Data Model to be able to access the aggregated data outside of Meta Woot!.
This can be done by selecting 'Display For All apps' from Settings > Data models > Meta Woot License Usage > Edit > Edit Permissions and by making sure to at least set read permissions for the role that will be used to launch the App.
4 - Configure the '_internal' index as an allowed index for your role. As Meta Woot's License Usage Data Model gathers data from the '_internal' index, your role should be able to query this index.
It can be set by adding '_internal' index to the allowed indexes attached to Settings > Access controls > Roles > [Your role].
5 - In a distributed environment, make sure internal data from your License Master is being indexed on your Indexers and therefore available from your Search Head(s).
You should retrieve results from the following query: index=""_internal"" sourcetype=""splunkd"" source=""*license_usage.log"" type=""Usage""
6 - If deployed on an earlier version of Splunk (pre 7.1) add 'color=""#333333""' to the first line of the default navigation menu (Settings > User interface > Navigation menus > default).
Configuration Steps
REST URIs for rest API calls:
Splunk queries part of this App consist in REST API calls. It should work as-is if your Splunk platform is quite simple since the queries are expecting results from your Indexer(s) only.
If, however, your Splunk platform is more complex (i.e. if the search peers configured on your Search Head(s) are not only Indexer(s)), then you might have to adjust queries by specifying the appropriate REST URI.
For instance, '| rest /services/data/indexes' would become '| rest splunk_server=<rest-uri> /services/data/indexes' with <rest-uri> possibly containing wildcards (i.e. '| rest splunk_server=splunk-indexer* /services/data/indexes').
Replication factor for Indexer Cluster:
To predict what will be the final size of an index, the following formula is being used in both 'Index usage' and 'Global usage' dashboards:
daily average volume indexed by indexer in GB x 0.5 (average compression) x replication factor (if applicable) x retention period in days
As the replication factor could only be obtained by making an API CALL to the Cluster Master, it has not been integrated in the queries.
Therefore, if you run an Indexer Cluster, you must find out what is the replication factor and then add it to the queries.
To find out what replication factor is applied to your Indexer Cluster, you can use the following query from you Cluster Master:
| rest splunk_server=local /servicesNS/-/-/configs/conf-server
| search replication_factor=*
| fields replication_factor site_replication_factor multisite eai:acl.app
| rex field=site_replication_factor ""total\:(?<repFactor>\d+)""
| eval replication_factor=if(multisite==1,repFactor,replication_factor)
| fields - multisite site_replication_factor repFactor
Then, you should integrate its value to both queries.
In 'Index usage' dashboard, expectedIndexSizeGB=consumedDailyPerIndexerGB0.5frozenTimePeriodDays would become expectedIndexSizeGB=consumedDailyPerIndexerGB0.5<your_replication_factor>*frozenTimePeriodDays.
In 'Global usage' dashboard, expectedIndexSizeGB=round((consumedDailyGB0.5frozenTimePeriodDays),0) would become expectedIndexSizeGB=round((consumedDailyGB0.5<your_replication_factor>*frozenTimePeriodDays),0).
In any case, double check on the value obtained for expectedIndexSizeGB to make sure it is coherent to your platform.
App deployment
Deploy the App on your Search Head.
Use the App
Once ready to use, 'Index usage' is the main dashboard to visit as it provides a glimpse into your indexes statistics and configurations.
From there you can drilldown to either 'Index Configuration' or 'Time-base ingestion' dashboard.
The 'Time-based ingestion' dahsboard provides the daily ingestion volume by index for a wider period - 30 days - displayed as a timechart. You can also pick several indexes from there.
Comparing to the 'Index usage' dashboard, the 'Global usage' dashboard provides global insights on your indexes' sizing and configuration.
The 'Age of data' dahsboard lets you quickly check on the age of the data for each index.
Finally, the 'Index configuration' dashboard let you browse your current index configuration to check on the various parameters. You can pick multiple indexes and configuration parameters for comparison.
Alert
One alert is included in this App.
Whenever an index reaches 90% of its maximum size, the 'Index nearly full' alert is triggered.
The alert has been disabled by default. Adjust and enable it as preferred.

Provides method to consume Salesforce.com reports via REST API without SOQL/SOSL queries to be indexed, put in kvstore, or both.  Take your existing reports or build new ones via the Salesforce.com UI and automate their ingestion into Splunk without the fuss of developer consoles or complex salesforce query languages.
This add-on provides a modular input to connect to Salesforce.com via user credentials and ""security token"" with options to index reports to a configurable index or store the responses to Splunk's kvstore, or both.  If storing reports to the kvstore, the input includes configuration options to:
- Create and update a kvstore (knowledge object) and specify its name
- Create and update a lookup (knowledge object) and specify its name
- Define a ""key fieldname"" from report to be used as the ""_key"" record for the kvstore (one or more comma delimited fields may be specified to define a unique record)
- Purge the kvstore at each update (deletes all records in the kvstore at each update)
Requirements:

Requires Salesforce security token (does not support 2-factor tokens). See Salesforce documentation on ""resetting my security token"" or options under ""My Profile"" in your account. (https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=user_security_token.htm)
INFO logging provides detail to identify issues with authentication and report access but can be set to DEBUG for introspection into event level issues.


More detailed documentation will be included in future updates.

v1.0.4 (I hate API limits!)

Changed Salesforce python client library to ""Simple Salesforce""
Changed from Salesforce reporting API to as source in favor of CSV export to overcome 2k record limit
Minor UI enhancement to show more than 10 inputs per-page
Improved status logging to checkpointer kvstore (future use)
Improvements to lookup & kvstore field creation & update methods (issue with lookups not updating for new fields)
Additional ""purge"" options to allow for multiple reports writing to same kvstore
""All Records"": purge all contents of the specified kvstore (default)
""Report Only"": purge records created by this input (multiple inputs may write to same kvstore)
""Disabled"": disable purge for the input (may result in duplicate records)


The ""KVStore Key Fieldname"" parameter will accept comma-separated field values (enclose in quotes if spaces in fieldnames) and concatenate with a hyphen to create unique row identifiers when individual fields won't

Added ""_updated"" and ""_input_id"" meta fields to kvstore functions (not added to lookups or kvstore fields; may be manually added)

""_updated"": timestamp of report row insertion to assist with troubleshooting
""_input_id"": enables identification of input which inserted record into kvstore (used in purge functions)

NOTICE: this release assumes default Salesforce CSV export behavior (appends a footer to the CSV) & drops the last 5 lines of the report.  If your Salesforce instance does not append the footer, your report may not be complete! A parameter will be added in next release.

As a result, we will End Of Sale the Splunk Supporting Add-on for VMware on April 30, 2021 and End of Life will be January 11, 2023 . Prior to launching IT Essentials Work, Splunk has offered multiple Splunkbase apps to manage their IT infrastructure, and customers have had to maintain each of these apps individually. IT Essentials Work allows customers to monitor many types of different infrastructure types side by side, without having to switch between different apps.  We highly recommend that customers either purchase IT Service Intelligence to holistically monitor virtualized environments or use the latest free version of IT Essentials Work 4.9 (available May 2021) for out of the box host level VMware infrastructure monitoring. For more details on this announcement and migration options, please contact your sales representative.Splunk Supporting Add-on for VMware is a collection of dashboards that provides insights about the capacity of clusters, hosts, and allows administrators to plan for allocating resources across different VMware infrastructure components.The dashboards leverage data collected using Splunk Add-on for VMware Metrics. The dashboards from Splunk Supporting Add-on for VMware also works as a complementary app along with IT Essentials Work.

Install
This app can be installed on a Search Head for on-premise Splunk Enterprise customers. For customers using Splunk Cloud, install this app on your search head for victoria experience customers or both your IDM and SH for classic customers.
Install the app. For Splunk Cloud, refer to Install apps in your Splunk Cloud deployment. For customer-managed deployments, refer to the standard methods for Splunk Add-on installs as documented for a Single Server Install or a Distributed Environment Install.
Configuration
By default the app comes with a pre-configured and disabled input named nhs_cyberalerts, that will fetch cyber alerts daily via REST API and store them in the default index. This input needs to be enabled via the UI. 
It is best practice to place your cyber alerts into another index other than the default main index, please make sure you update the macro 'default_index' with definitions such as index=<YOUR_INDEX>
Usage
Once installed, from your Splunk instance Web Interface, select the app DSPT Compliance and navigate through the dashboards to verify content.
The app aims to assist in DSPT assertions where IT staff are asked to regularly review certain activity types or provide evidence against assertions. Where a monitoring requirement is required the dashboards found within the 'Audit"" drop-down can be used. Where Evidence is required, reports can be found to facilitate the capture of the required information.
Known Issues
There are no known issues at this time.
Troubleshooting
Useful SPL searches to:
Verify Cyber Alerts indexing index=_internal nhs_cyberalerts.py
Verify the index has been populated with Cyber Alerts index=main
Please replace main with the index specified in the configuration and make sure the time range is set on All time
Upgrade
No special instructions for upgrading this app to a newer version.

Prerequisites

The Sizing Inputs Calculator for Splunk requires visibility to all Search Heads and Indexers in the deployment. Therefore, it is recommended to install the Sizing Inputs Calculator for Splunk on a Splunk instance that has a Monitoring Console, or a Splunk instance for which all search heads and indexers are set up as search peers.
The Sizing Inputs Calculator for Splunk assumes that the instance it is running on conforms to the Splunk recommended hardware. If the instance this app is running on does not conform to the Splunk recommended hardware, there may not be enough concurrent searches for the dashboard to render. 

Install
Install the Sizing Inputs Calculator for Splunk in accordance to the documentation for a Single Server Install. 
Configuration
This app uses a search macro to easily select the earliest time (in days) that the searches should look back. The macro is called earliest and it is currently set to look back 7 days by default.
For example, the Daily Search Count search utilizes the earliest search macro:
`earliest` latest=@d index=_audit host=* action=search sourcetype=audittrail search_id!=""*rsa_*""         search_id!=""*subsearch*""
| timechart span=1d dc(search_id) AS ""Daily Search Count""
| stats perc95(""Daily Search Count"") AS ""Daily Search Count""
This earliest macro can easily be edited to change to look back a different time range that that set by default:

Select Settings > Advanced Search > Search macros
Click on the earliest macro and change its definition (earliest=-7day@day) as desired

Usage
After installing the Sizing Inputs Calculator for Splunk, users can navigate to the Sizing Inputs Calculator for Splunk app to view a dashboard that renders sizing information about the deployment. Users should share this information back to their Splunk Account team by exporting the dashboard as a PDF.
Known Issues
There are no known issues at this time.

App Description
Mothership is a Splunk App that provides a single pane of glass into large multi-instance Splunk deployments. Mothership dispatches SPL on remote Splunk instances on a scheduled interval and retrieves and stores search results locally. Field extraction is preserved, requiring no configuration other than a valid username and password for a service account on the remote machine.  An administrative interface with REST services is provided to simplify management and reporting. All remote search results are stored in RBAC controllable stores (i.e., lookups, indexes).
Installation
In a Single-Instance Deployment

If you have internet access from your Splunk server, download and install the app by clicking 'Browse More Apps' from the Manage Apps page in the Splunk platform.
Otherwise, download the app from Splunkbase and install it using the Manage Apps page in the Splunk platform.

In a Distributed Deployment or a Search Head Cluster Deployment
The Mothership app will write summary results to lookups (transforming searches) and/or indexes (non-transforming searches). In a distributed environment or Search Head Cluster, lookups populated by Mothership can be replicated across the cluster, this means that Mothership running exclusively transforming searches (which write to a lookup) will work with a properly configured Distributed or Search Head Cluster Deployment. Non-transforming searches (which write to an index) are currently not supported in a distributed or Search Head Cluster deployment.
Configuration

The Mothership administrative user interface can be found in the Environments dashboard of the Mothership Splunk App.
From this dashboard, and administrator has full lifecycle (create, read, update, delete) control of environments and associated environment searches.
The following quickstart will walk through the configuration of a single environment with a single search from the management page.

Quickstart

To get started, let's configure an environment and environment search which will allow us to query the Splunk instance running Mothership.
We will be using the Mothership administrative user interface.
Select the 'New Environment' button and fill out the fields as follows.
Name: ""My First Environment""
Management Server: ""https://localhost:8089"" (edit the hostname and port to reflect the management host server port of the environment Mothership is running on)
Web Server: Leave blank
Username: Provide the username of a properly credentialed service account (should be able to search)
Password: Provide the password of the service account provided above
Leave all other fields as is and click 'Save'.




We will now configure an environment search for the environment we just created.
Expand the environment by clicking the '>' column.
Select the 'New Search' button and fill out the fields as follows.
Label: ""My First Search""
In the inline search text area, provide the following SPL search string: | rest /services/licenser/groups
Leave all other fields as is and click 'Save'.




You may need to refresh the tables. This can be accomplished by clicking the refresh icon next to the Environments or Searches heading.
This environment is now being regularly queried on the provided schedule with the provided search. You can view the results of this query by clicking on the Edit menu in the Actions column and selecting Results.
Explore the other options available to you in the Edit menu. This menu will provide you with lifecycle management options (create, read, update, delete) ad-hoc querying, metrics and debug logs, and more.

Troubleshooting
Mothership logs all transactions made to a remote machine including success and error state to the _internal index with the following source *environment_poller_debug.log. Click on the ""Debug"" link found in the ""Actions"" dropdown for either the Environment or Environment Search to debug errors.",Version 1.3.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/0fcc9140-658c-11eb-b836-06add55d78f8.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance, Utilities",https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-software-license-agreement.html,965,0,splunk,5,5,Splunk Works,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/splunklabs,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

What is a Nest?
The Nest is a smart and self-learning thermostat device for your home's heating and cooling systems. Alongside an easy to use interface, it also includes an Android app, an iPhone app, and a browser-based app to let you view the status and control the device.
What does this app do?
One of the ""issues"" I had with the web-based application was the limited amount of data and metrics it presented to you. On top of that, the data was locked-in - there was no data to export to feed into your own systems for further processing and long-term keeping. The Nest apps seem to only keep data for about 10 days.
This app includes a Splunk Modular Input that when provided with your Nest's login credentials will periodically poll the same APIs the Android, iPhone, and web apps connect to and pull down schedule, temperature, and many other metrics from the site.
The app provides a set of dashboards to visualize some, but not all, of the collected data. There's a lot of data, so feel free to explore everything under sourcetype = nest and see what you can come up with!

Disclaimer
This is an unoffical app, and is not sponsored, endorsed by, or have any connection with Nest Labs, the creators of the Nest thermostat. 
This app uses undocumented APIs on Nest.com's website. It is entirely possible that everything may break if they decide to update their APIs, which would likely break existing dashboards, or break the data collection altogether.
Although the script only scrapes data using read-only API endpoints, I am also not responsible if the script somehow sets your thermostat to extreme temperatures.
Setting up the App
Via inputs.conf
The most straight-forward way is to simply create an entry in inputs.conf. The pre-built dashboards are not hard-coded to any specific index, so feel free to use an index of your choosing. A recommended interval value should be around 300-600 seconds (5 to 10 minutes). 
[nest://My Nest Thermostat]
username = me@example.com
password = mypassword
interval = 300
index = myIndex

Via the Splunk Web GUI
Log into Splunk, and go to:
Settings > Data Inputs > Nest Thermostat Information > Add New
Fill in your username and password for  your Nest.com account. Make sure to check the More Settings box, and specify an interval. As mentioned above, an interval of 300 to 600 seconds is recommended.",Version 1.0.3,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/f186a716-c0ba-11e3-a1c3-0a0f426107f5.png,"Utilities, IoT & Industrial Data",http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/legalcode.txt,"1,755",0,splunk,5,7,Rich Acosta,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/Ricapar,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4560,2022-01-10,07:19:11 AM,Gmail Audit,,"Feb. 18, 2021","Overview
The Gmail Audit TA for Splunk allows a Splunk Enterprise administrator to interface with Google G Suite and Gmail to achieve the following for one or more G Suite domains:

Gather a list of users and their attributes from the G Suite Directory
Enable Gmail auditing for users in the G Suite Directory and configure audit events to be sent to an audit recipient inbox
Gather audit events from the inbox of the audit recipient user

WARNING: Due to the way the Gmail audit process works, i.e. audit events are sent to an Gmail inbox of a user in the same domain, there are hard-limits to the number of emails that can be received by that user. If you have a large number of users in your domain(s) and they are all sending audit events to this inbox each time a user sends or receives an email, the audit user inbox gets swamped and is not able to receive email until the suspension is lifted. Gmail receive limits are detailed here: https://support.google.com/a/answer/1366776?hl=en
Scripts and binaries
This App provides the following scripts:









gmail_authorize.py
This Python custom endpoint allows the authorization of the App to G Suite For Splunk from the web UI.


input_module_gsuite_directory_user_list.py
Gather a listing of users from the G Suite Directory and load them into Splunk.


input_module_gmail_enforce_audit.py
Enable Gmail audit for any users in the directory that do not currently have auditing enabled.


input_module_gmail_disable_audit.py
Disable Gmail audit for any users in the directory that have auditing enabled. This is not part of the add-on UI yet. If you need to use this, overwrite the input_module_gmail_enforce_audit.py audit with this script and let it run to disable auditing.


input_module_gmail_retrieve_audit_data.py
Retrieve audit events from the inbox of the recipient user, load into Splunk and mark messages as read.


Utilities.py
Allows utility interactions with Splunk Endpoints



Installation

Download the add-on from Splunkbase
Install the add-on onto your Splunk instance. This could be a single-instance or a data collection instance (HF). Install via the UI or CLI as you would any other Splunk app.
Restart Splunk

Configuration
Key concepts for Gmail Audit TA for Splunk

You must have enabled the G Suite APIs at https://console.developers.google.com
You must have configured a credential for use with this App at https://console.developers.google.com.
You must AUTHORIZE this app to make requests into G Suite APIs.
It is HIGHLY recommended to setup a separate Splunk-specific Super Admin user within Google G Suite for use with this add-on

G Suite: Enable APIs
For a detailed guide with screenshots about what to do here, please visit my blog about this add-on: Gmail Audit TA for Splunk
Inputs
The app provides three input templates. Each requires an HTTP Event Collector token to which to send events. These do not need to be unique and can be the same token for all three inputs.
HTTP Event Collector

Configure a new HTTP Event Collector token and use this when configuring the inputs. Follow this guide if you are unsure how to setup a HEC token.

G Suite Directory User List

Enter a name for the input (include the domain in the name if you are using multiple domains for clarity)
Set the interval (e.g. once per day [86400 seconds])
Choose the destination index
Enter the domain for which you have configured and authorised credentials
Enter an HTTP Event Collector token to receive the events
Enter the hostname to which to send events (in most cases this should be localhost, where the HEC token is configured)

Gmail Enforce Audit

Enter a name for the input (include the domain in the name if you are using multiple domains for clarity)
Set the interval (e.g. once per day [86400 seconds])
Choose the destination index
Enter the Audit Recipient address (this should be the email of the Super Admin account used to authorize the credentials)
Enter an HTTP Event Collector token to receive the events
Enter the hostname to which to send events (in most cases this should be localhost, where the HEC token is configured)

Caveat
There seems to be a hard 1000 request per day limit on the Gmail Audit API. I tried to get this increased, but did not have any luck.
The request to check if auditing is enabled counts as 1 request, as does the call to set auditing if it is not enabled, which means you can check and enable auditing on only 500 users per day.
The first thing this script does is read the G Suite Directory and get a list of all users in the domain. If there are more than 500 users returned, the script will randomly delete half the users in the list (think Thanos snapping his fingers). This ensures that the script does not run into API limits and over time, all users will evenutally have auditing enabled.
If anyone knows how to get that limit increased, please let me know and I will gladly remove that bit of code.
Gmail Retrieve Audit Data

Enter a name for the input (include the name of the domain if you are using multiple domains for clarity e.g. example.com-Enable-audit, example.com-Retrieve-audit )
Set the interval (e.g. once every 5 minutes [300 seconds])
Choose the destination index
Enter the domain for which you have configured and authorised credentials
Enter an HTTP Event Collector token to receive the events
Enter the hostname to which to send events (in most cases this should be localhost, where the HEC token is configured)
Enter a batch size of audit messages to process. 20 is a good default as it does not seem to run into API limits.

Troubleshooting
Proxy
If you see any errors like this, it is likely that there is another add-on installed in your environment that has a httplib2 module included in its directory structure. 
2019-07-25 03:56:09,304 log_level=ERROR pid=89865 tid=MainThread file=""gmail_authorize.py"" function=""handle_GET"" line_number=""112"" version=""TA-gmail-audit.1.0.5"" {'errors': [{'msg': 'setproxy() takes at most 7 arguments (8 given)', 'exception_type': 'TypeError', 'line': 104, 'exception_arguments': 'setproxy() takes at most 7 arguments (8 given)', 'filename': 'gmail_authorize.py'}], 'log_level': 'ERROR'}
Any submodules included in any apps installed/enabled are visible to Splunk Python, so if you say ""include httplib2"" in your module, you have no guarantee that the module included in your app folder is going to be used. I think it simply uses the first one it finds.
If you run into this error, modify the /opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-gmail-audit/bin/gmail_authorize.py script and uncomment the following lines:
# import imp
# modfile, pathname, description = imp.find_module('httplib2', ['/opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-gmail-audit/bin/'])
# httplib2 = imp.load_module('httplib2', modfile, pathname, description)`
Obviosuly adjust the path if your Splunk and add-on are installed in a location other than '/opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-gmail-audit/bin/'
This ensures the httlib2 module included in the Gmail Audit TA folder is used and not any other httplib2 modules found in other apps/add-ons.

The Splunk app for Credant gathers log data from the Credant application server and provides normalization as well as some correlation for reporting. For instance you can generate reports on connections to your internal and external policy proxy servers by hostname, not just shield ID. The same correlation is done for usernames.

In addition, important field extractions are already created, along with event types for things you would expect, like new activations, hidden/removed devices restored, etc.
Using Splunk for Credant
Copy TA-credant to the /etc/apps directory of your primary Splunk installation
Install a universal forwarder on your Credant application server and any policy proxy servers you have in the environment
To create the hostname and user to shield ID mappings run the following over all time:
credant_shield2host
credant_uid2user
credant_shield2uid
Note that this correlation relies on the retainment of compatibility server logs with the initial activations of your devices and users. If this data is not part of the logs indexed by Splunk, the mapping is not possible.

A Splunk app to provide insight into index state

This application is aimed at helping administrators understand the current
state of their index, as it relates to disk footprint, and the retention
settings for the index.
Due to changes in the operation of dbinspect introduced in Splunk 6.0, as well
as changes to the application packaging, this app by itself is no longer
sufficient to collect data for a standalone system. The TA-fire_brigade
application will also be required, to act as the data collection source.
In a distributed environment, the TA-fire_brigade app will also be required.
In small environments, a single installation of the TA on the search head can
collect data from all of the indexers. In larger installations, however, the
TA should be installed on all indexing nodes, and not on the search head.
The TA (and a saved search within the full app) collects data using the
dbinspect search command. This detail of the constituent buckets in the index
is used to drive several visualizations about the state of the index.
Compatibility
The output from the dbinspect command changed in version 6.0. This app is
specifically tuned for version 6.0 and higher. If you're running Splunk 4.3 or
Splunk 5.x, use TA-fire_brigade version 1.
Thanks and Acknowledgements
Thanks to all of the sites that tested early versions of the application. My
colleagues were helpful in getting the application to a wider audience, as
well as providing critical feedback in improving the dashboards.

Mainframes power mission-critical applications around the world. But many organizations are still flying blind, with no easy way to derive operational intelligence from the vast amounts of machine data generated by these critical systems.
It’s time for data streams from the mainframe to be as accessible as your other data streams when it comes to analytics for business intelligence and security monitoring.
Syncsort Ironstream enables you to collect and forward z/OS log data, including security data, into Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Enterprise Security, where you can get that true 360-degree view.
Users can then easily search, analyze, and visualize the data for powerful business intelligence reporting -- without needing specialized expertise and different monitoring systems for z/OS.
Make more sense of the massive machine data piled up in your mainframe.

Why would you prefer agentless approach? First of all is performance and second is seamless integration. No one likes installing new Agent. There is always this discussion if it is secure enough, fast enough and does not consume too much performance to run. If machine is highly utilized then agent also requires more performance to send more information. Complicated ? No, if You use agentless Windows Event Log subscription. Our Event Collector is free of listed problems: there is not agent, subscription is native for Windows and all communication is encrypted.
Is Your Splunk running on Linux ? With Energy Event Collector You can directly subscribe to Windows Event Forwarding service from Your Linux box. We support output using xml, syslog and syslog-tls protocol both over network and using files.

Add-on to support ingestion of Mixpanel data into Splunk.
App Setup:


Prior to installing, retrieve your Mixpanel project's API Key and Secret from Mixpanel account (take care to protect them as you would passwords). 

Finding your Mixpanel Project API information



Once retrieved, return to the add-on's ""Configuration"" page and ""Mixpanel Project"" tab to add new Mixpanel Project credentials.


Once successfully completed, you may add inputs via the add-on's ""Inputs"" page, clicking ""Create New Input"", then clicking an input type you wish to create.


Export API Input:
Accesses Mixpanel's data export API which provides raw events from date range specified with daily granularity (returning all events by day).  This app will initially pull the previous day's events at a daily interval and maintain a checkpoint of its last successful export.  Depending on your project's event volume, exporting larger time spans could cause Splunk to index a very large amount of data.  Due to the limited granularity of this API, running it more frequently than once (1) daily would create duplicate records.

This input requires the Mixpanel project timezone to correctly set input checkpoints. Future updates may expand the use of this configuration to simplify setup, etc.

Live API Input (UNOFFICIAL):
Accesses Mixpanel's ""Live"" API which is used in the Mixpanel UI to display events as they arrive. This input leverages this unofficial & undocumented API to provide visibility with higher frequency than the data export API at the tradeoff of accuracy.  Per Mixpanel documentation, some browser clients can significantly delay sending events to Mixpanel (such as mobile apps) and will likely not be displayed via this input.  To prevent duplication of events, this input maintains a checkpoint of its last successful execution and discards events with timestamps dated prior to that checkpoint.

As this API is undocumented and its behavior may cause discrepancies from the export API and/or inaccurate reporting over time. It is included to provide a more real-time introspection into your project's activities with these caveats.

""People"" Engage API Input:
Accesses Mixpanel's ""People"" API (officially documented as ""Engage API"") which provides summarized/deduplicated user information often required for correlating or attributing user activity. The data returned from this input may be indexed but is often more useful when put into a kvstore collection for performing lookups.  This input does not index data by default but creates a kvstore collection based on the name given to the input.
KVStore name format:
TA_Mixpanel_People_{Input Name}
The fields returned by this API will vary based on your project's configurations but could include information such as: browser type and version, geolocation information, more detailed user metadata (name, email, phone, etc.), and more.  Due to probable performance impacts from the high variability of fields and types, this input does not create kvstore or lookup fields configurations dynamically.
By default, this input provides the base field schema for events returned and will  require modification of the ""KVStore Fields"" JSON object ({} or python dictionary) of the input's configuration. You must configure each field's name and type as a valid JSON object for kvstore and lookup configurations to be auto generated. By default, this input removes dollar symbols (""$"") from field names due to incompatability with the Splunk kvstore.  When referenceing field names, DO NOT use the dollar symbols.
Example record from Mixpanel: 
{""$distinct_id"": 4,
              ""$properties"": {""$created"": ""2008-12-12T11:20:47"",
                              ""$email"": ""example@mixpanel.com"",
                              ""$first_name"": ""Example"",
                              ""$last_name"": ""Name"",
                              ""$last_seen"": ""2008-06-09T23:08:40"",}}
Example ""KVStore Fields"" configuration:
{""distinct_id"":""number"",""properties.created"":""string"",""properties.email"":""string"",""properties.first_name"":""string"",""properties.last_name"":""string"",""properties.last_seen"":""string""}
Default ""KVStore Fields"" configuration (base schema):
{""distinct_id"":""string"",""properties"":""array""}
For detail on kvstore fields and types, see Splunk kvstore documentation.

Mixpanel People API documentation


Timezone Configuration:
For the Mixpanel Export API, the timezone is based on your Mixpanel project's configurations. Configure props.conf ""TZ"" setting per Splunk's documentation to match your projects configurations. If ingesting multiple projects with with different timezone configurations, you should configure additional sourcetypes or remove timestamp parsing from props.conf. See the Mixpanel API documentation for more information on timestamps and the Export API.

Standard Splunk configuration which can be found here: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware

TOPOLOGY AND SETTING UP SPLUNK ENVIRONMENT


This app can be set up in two ways:

Standalone Mode:
Install the Cofense Triage Add-On.


Distributed Environment:
Install the Cofense Triage Add-On on the search head. User does not need to configure an account or create an input in Cofense Triage Add-on on search head.
Install only Cofense Triage Add-on on the heavy forwarder. User needs to configure account and needs to create data input to collect data from Cofense Triage platform.
User needs to manually create an index on the indexer (No need to install Cofense Triage Add-on on indexer).





INSTALLATION
Cofense Triage Add-On can be installed through UI using ""Manage Apps"" > ""Install app from file"" or by extracting tarball directly into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ folder.
CONFIGURATION
Users will be required to have admin_all_objects capability in order to configure Cofense Triage Add-On. This Add-on allows a user to configure multiple account of Cofense Triage Instance. In case a user is using the integration in search head cluster environment, configuration on all the search cluster nodes will be overwritten as and when a user changes some configuration on any one of the search head cluster members. Hence a user should configure the integration on only one of the search head cluster members. Once the installation is done successfully, follow the below steps to configure.

Note: * denotes required fields
Guidelines:

Status and Executive Summary is summary kind of data, so Start Time, End Time, and Re Ingest fields will be disabled for those endpoint values.
Once the input will be created, following fields will be disabled on Edit, to prevent data duplication or data loss.
Endpoint
Start Time
End Time


If End Time is provided, Add-On will collect data between Start Time and End Time and will stop collecting data after the data in the range is collected.
If Re Ingest is checked, the Add-On will collect data in the given time range (default values will be used in case they are left empty), and then the checkbox will be un-checked and regular data collection will continue for that input. 
We are not restricting users with limited historical data, but it is recommended not to collect data older than 12 months as it might impact Add-On performance.

UPGRADE
Upgrade from Cofense Triage Add-On v1.x.x to v2.x.x is NOT supported. Still one can install v2.0.0 or v2.0.1 of Cofense Triage Add-On by following the steps mentioned below:

Note: Splunk Universal Forwarders 8.0.0+ have a known issue around PowerShell inputs.
Please open a support case mentioning issue SPL-196294 to receive the fixed splunk-powershell-common.ps1.
This TA executes the Sysinternals Autoruns CLI utility and returns the results to be picked up by Splunk.
This TA was inspired by Palantir's AutorunsToWinEventLog (https://github.com/palantir/windows-event-forwarding), but instead of creating a scheduled task and writing to the EventLog it uses a scripted input directly.
Make sure to download autorunsc64.exe from https://live.sysinternals.com/autorunsc64.exe and place it into the bin folder. To enable the input copy default\inputs.conf into local and set disabled = false.
Warning: This script gets executed with a priority class of 'BelowNormal' to avoid performance impacts, still the scheduling of the script should be chosen wisely and impact to systems should be tested before using it on a large scale.
It's possible (and probably advised) to create a baseline and only log newly created or removed entries (you know...splunk and volume based licensing...) Additionally the recreation of the baseline can be scheduled as well to work with retention policies. The following example creates a new baseline every 7 days and logs changes every 4 hours.
[powershell://Autoruns]
script = . ""$SplunkHome\etc\apps\TA-autoruns\bin\autoruns.ps1"" -MaxBaselineAge 7:00:00:00
schedule = 0 */4 * * *
sourcetype = autoruns
disabled = false
If you don't specify -MaxBaselineAge only changes will be logged per default:
[powershell://Autoruns]
script = . ""$SplunkHome\etc\apps\TA-autoruns\bin\autoruns.ps1""
schedule = 0 */4 * * *
sourcetype = autoruns
disabled = false
If you want to force the creation of a new baseline on every run you can pass the -Baseline argument
[powershell://Autoruns]
script = . ""$SplunkHome\etc\apps\TA-autoruns\bin\autoruns.ps1 -Baseline""
schedule = 0 */4 * * *

About PAVO Network Traffic App for Splunk
Overview
Very often, network traffic events can provide a lot of information about misconfigurations, potential attacks, and user activity. This app provides searches and dashboards based on the Splunk Common Information Model to help provide insight into your network traffic.
A note on Splunk Data Model Acceleration and Disk Space
This app requires data model acceleration, which will use additional disk space. If you are using the Splunk App for Enterprise Security, this is already enabled, and should have been factored into your retention policies. If not, you should review the documentation on data model acceleration, how it uses disk space, and how to plan for it.
A note on the Splunk Common Information Model
As mentioned above, the app uses the CIM for network traffic events. The CIM allows you to take events from a number of network traffic sources or products, and report on them in one cohesive manner, using a common set of names for fields and event types.
A note on the Network Traffic Data Model, src, dest, src_ip, and dest_ip
The Network Traffic data model includes both src, dest fields, and src_ip, dest_ip fields. For this app, we have opted to use the *_ip versions of these fields, in case hostnames are being used for the other fields. Make sure your field extractions are correctly populating these fields.
Available Dashboards
Network Traffic Overview
Provides a general overview of the network traffic events.
IP Profile
Provides information around an IP address (both dest_ip and src_ip), including traffic from, to, and possible open ports.
Transport Information
Information around the transport field of events (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.).
Port Information
This form provides information based on the destination port (dest_port) field of events, such as the traffic over time, conversations, and sources.
Internal and External Traffic
Currently just top destinations (external and from external to internal). The determination on internal vs. external is configured by macros. See the App Configuration Macros section of this document.
Scanning Activity
This dashboard provides the top potential scanners (both host and port scanners) based on network traffic.
Geographic Information
This is based on the geo-ip information provided by the built-in IP location from Splunk. Internal traffic is excluded from this page. Note: The searches on this page may take a while to load.
Network Traffic Search
A form which allows for searching network traffic events based on a few different parameters.
VPN Traffic Overview
This dashboard provides an overview of VPN traffic that has been observed. This dashboard uses accelerated data models and macros. Please make sure you accelerate the Network Traffic and Network Sessions data models. It is possible that there are different values for action and signature. This app expects signature=login, signature=logout, action=success or action=failure.
Data Transparency Overview
This dashboard provides field information from the data models used to retrieve data for this application. Included information includes indexes and sourcetypes found in the data model. This dashboard also shows fields and constraints in the data models.
Sourcetype Information
Information about the sourcetypes which are present in the accelerated data. Note: This dashboard is not shown in the navigation bar. To view this dashboard, go to Settings -> User Interface -> Views -> and select the Open option next to the sourcetype_information item in the list.
About
A simple HTML version of this document. Note: This dashboard is not shown in the navigation bar. To view this dashboard, go to Settings -> User Interface -> Views -> and select the Open option next to the About item in the list.

Prerequisites
Because this App runs on Splunk Enterprise, all of the Splunk Enterprise system requirements apply.
This app depends on data models included in the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on, specifically the Network Traffic data model. Please review the information on installing and using the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on and information on configuring the acceleration on the data model.
The Splunk Common Information Model Add-on can be downloaded from Splunkbase.
This app has been tested with versions 4.9 of the CIM add-on.
In order to make the app respond and load quickly, accelerated data models are used to provide summary data. For this data to be available, the Network Traffic data model must be accelerated. Information on how to enable acceleration for the Network Traffic data model can be found here. The data model must be accelerated for the length of time for which you would like to see reporting.
The Breakdown of Sourcetypes in Indexes in Dataset panel on the Data Transparency Overview dashboard will only be seen if the Sankey Diagram visualization is installed.
The Sankey Diagram Visualization can be downloaded from Sankey Diagram Custom Visualization.
This app may require some configuration before it will work properly (outside of the configuration of the Data Model Acceleration). In particular, you may need to edit the configuration macros, as well as the lookup which populates the Device dropdown found on many of the dashboards.
This macro contains the search which is used to populate the Devices dropdown found on many of the dashboards. By default this is the auto-generated lookup, however, the macro can be edited to point to another lookup as needed.
This macro contains a partial search which determines when a network traffic events destination IP address is external to your network. By default this will exclude private IP addresses, but can be edited to reflect your own network configuration. Note: this search snippet is used in searches using the accelerated data models and the tstats command. While the normal SPL does support CIDR, tstats does not. Make sure your search syntax will work with the tstats command.

Make sure your search syntax will work with the tstats command.
For the Device dropdown, present on many of the dashboards, you can use the auto-generated lookup, which runs every morning at 2 am. If your Network_Traffic data model is populated, you can run the saved search network_traffic_dvc_auto_gen to populate the dropdown.
The lookup has two fields: dvc and device_name. device_name can be a description of the device. dvc can be wild-carded (not CIDR, as that is not available in tstats searches used with the accelerated data models). The search used to populate this dropdown can be configured using the network_traffic_dvcs macro.

This App provides valuable insight via three pre-built dashboards that display real-time OT asset and threat intelligence data provided by Forescout's premium OT security solution, eyeInspect (previously named SilentDefense).
Forescout Security Dashboard
Overarching question answered:
Are there any urgent threats that I need to focus on and what should I do to respond? The Security Dashboard helps the user to identify alert trends and correlate them with other network activity, enabling a faster detection of anomalies, cyber threats, dangerous commands sent to OT devices and device misbehavior. It allows to reduce Mean Time to Response by providing the context needed to determine the best mitigation action.
Subquestions:
What are the latest alerts in my network?  The “Recent OT Network Security Monitoring Alerts” widget displays the most recent alerts with details like originating Sensor, Severity, Description, Source IP, Destination IP, Destination Port and Layer 7 Protocol. The ”ITL Alerts (24h/1h)” widget helps to monitor whether the alert trend has been increasing or decreasing in the selected time interval.
Are there any critical alerts I need to focus on immediately?  The “Alerts by Severity” widget categorizes alerts as Informational, Low, Medium, High, and Critical for immediate visibility and response to urgent issues.    
From where do my problems/threats originate?  The “Alerts by Sensor Name”, “Alerts by L7 Protocol” and “Alerts by Sensor Name by Protocol” widgets help to identify the origin of the alert. In particular, originating sensor information helps to identify the network  affected and protocol information allows to better drill down into potential threat vectors and the processes involved.
Is my network affected by cyber, operational or networking issues?  The “ITL Alerts by Category” widget displays the alerts generated by the eyeInspect Industrial Threat Library (ITL). The ITL detects threats that may impact one of the following three areas of responsibility: Operations, Security, and Networking. This allows to immediately assign the investigation and initiate response through the most appropriate personnel.
What type of problems/threats am I dealing with?  The “Alerts by Event Type” widget displays statistics about the number of events per type. This allows to identify which problems or threats occur more frequently.
Which assets are the most impacted?  The “Alert Types by IP” widget displays the number of alerts associated with the top 15 assets (source and/or destination). The “Alert Types by Source IP” widget helps identify the source of the anomalous changes of behavior.
Are there any relevant DNS requests that could provide useful context for my analysis?  The “DNS Queries - Top 15, DNS Queries – Fewest 10, Resolved DNS Queries – Top 10, Resolved DNS Queries - Fewest 10” widget allows the user to ensure that assets only communicate with legitimate domains. Suspicious or blacklisted domain names my indicate that the asset is infected (e.g. trying to reach out to malware C&C) or attempting unauthorized communications.
Is there any unauthorized network access to my assets?  Many OT protocols allow authentication on clear text protocols. It is important to monitor successful and failed authentication attempts to critical assets for both accountability and security reasons. The “Authentication Success”, ”Authentication Failures”,” Authentication Details” supports the user in this analysis.
Are there any encrypted connections with unauthorized SSL certificates in my network?  The “SSL Certificates Requested” widget Identifies SSL certificates used in the network in listing their Issuer, Validity, Expiration, Cipher Suite used, Source IP and Destination IP. This allows the user to identify (attempted) encrypted communications with unauthorized or invalid certificates.
Are there any unexpected file transfers that may indicate lateral movement?  The “File Activity” widget shows file access and transfers happening on the network, such as file reads, writes, or deletes. The file name indicated in the widget allows users to identify whether the operation is legitimate or represents, for instance, an exfiltration attempt of sensitive information or malware lateral movement.
Forescout Asset Inventory Dashboard
Overarching question answered: 
Are there any unexpected changes in my network?  The Asset Inventory Dashboard lets analysts access high-value device information and context to better identify unexpected changes in the network, prioritize investigations, and quickly acknowledge new assets, communication patterns, or protocols seen within the network to help the asset inventory and maintenance processes. 
Subquestions:
Is there any new device or relevant change in my network?  The “Assets – Added to Inventory” widget displays the list of assets seen by eyeInspect listing IP, MAC Address(es), Vendor/Model, Firmware version, Hardware version. In addition, the ”Assets with Modules – Added to Inventory” widget shows if new backplane modules have been added to PLCs.
Is there any new communication I’ve never seen?  The “Links - Last Seen 20” widget displays the last 20 communication links seen on the network within the selected time interval.
Are there any network connectivity issues?  The “Failed Connections” widget displays failed connections seen within the network that may indicate connectivity problems.
Did some asset go offline? Or are my assets attempting to communicate with unknown assets?  The “Ghost Nodes” widget displays ghost assets, i.e. assets receiving network requests but never responding.
Is someone using insecure protocols like TELNET, or uncommon protocols for OT like DHCP?  The “TELNET Protocol Used” and “DHCP Protocol Used” widgets help the user to identify the usage of these protocols.
Forescout Administrative Dashboard
Overarching question answered: 
How is the health of my Forescout eyeInspect installation? The Administrative Dashboard provides deep insights on system health status and user activity performed on the eyeInspect appliances, to prevent system failure and detect undesired user activity.  
Subquestions:
What is my eyeInspect system health status?  The “Health Changes” and “Connect/Disconnect Changes” widgets displays the latest health status changes of the eyeInspect components. For example, it displays when sensors are at a critical memory usage level and when sensors frequently connect and disconnect from a Command Center to enable quick response on issues that – if unattended – may leave to system failure.
Can I have complete accountability of the users’ behavior on eyeInspect?  The “User Activity” widget shows the activity being performed by eyeInspect users, such as logins or changes to sensor configuration. The “Failed Logins” widget shows recent login attempts and failures to highlight potential breaches.",Version 1.1.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/b38ed12a-7767-11eb-b852-0a7b70f2f7b0.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance, IoT & Industrial Data",https://www.forescout.com/company/legal/eula,341,0,splunk,5,1,Forescout Technologies,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/alliances4splunk,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

If the dashboards you need to make are a little too complex, clunky or limited in the Simple XML, but Splunk's HTML dashboards are just way out of reach,  Sideview Utils may be the tool for you. 

Just by wiring up Sideview modules together you can build a huge range of complex UI, without reading or writing any source code. 
If copying and pasting is your thing,  Sideview Utils itself contains hundreds of working examples of how to use its modules.  

Also if you have dashboards that use Splunk's Advanced XML with only the Splunk core modules, you have even more to gain:

Never have to use or think about 'intentions' again. Plug $foo$ tokens directly into searches, or into HTML, or anywhere.
Simple form element modules that are actually simple to configure.
Easier and more intuitive mechanisms for implementing whatever kinds of drilldowns you need.
Easier and more intuitive techniques to create links and drilldowns from any view to any other view and to have form elements prepopulate correctly. 
The Sideview Editor which will allow you to create and edit views and dashboards without ever reading or writing XML.
Format important information from your search results using your own HTML. 
Easily put icons, background colors and buttons inside the rows of your search result tables. 

And if you're using the 1.3.X version but you've held off on upgrading to 2.X and now 3.X, you may be crazy.  We have a Licensing FAQ page here that might resolve the uncertainty.  If not just contact us.  There have been hundreds of new features, new modules, new tools, bugfixes and big performance improvements that have happened since the 1.3 version came out 5.5 years ago.

Additional Configuration Notes

Searches for BlueCat DNS Edge data rely on a macro called ""get_bluecat_dns_edge_index"". By default this macro searches index=main. If you changed the index for your BlueCat data, please update this macro with the index name by going to Settings > Advanced Search > Search macros > get_bluecat_dns_edge_index and updating the search to match the index your data is in (e.g. index=bluecat)
These inputs can be modified at any time by visiting Settings > Data Inputs > BlueCat DNS Edge Modular Input
To get started with visualizing this data, install the BlueCat DNS Edge App for Splunk

Troubleshooting

Search Splunk internal logs: index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd log_level!=INFO bluecat_dns_edge.py
Verify data collection host has access to BlueCat DNS Edge server on port 443.

 Perficient Splunk Plus TM1 Technology Add-on (TA) for Splunk Enterprise (version 1.0)
 Splunk 6.3.x or above
* TM1 10.1 or higher 
INSTALLATION:
The Perficient Splunk Plus TM1 App for Splunk Enterprise uses the data provided by the Perficient Splunk Plus TM1 Technology Add-on (TA) for Splunk.  The TA must be downloaded, installed and properly configured prior to using this App.
Steps:


Install the Perficient Splunk Plus TM1 Technology Add-on (TA)  for Splunk Enterprise version 1.0 (available from Splunkbase) and follow the installation instructions.


Install the Perficient Splunk Plus TM1 App for Splunk Enterprise 
    a. In Splunk Enterprise, Navigate to ""Manage Apps"" then ""Install app from file""
    b. Select the "".spl"" file containing the Perficient Splunk Plus TM1 App for Splunk Enterprise and click upload
    c. Restart Splunk Enterprise as prompted
    d. In the setup screen, enter the name of the index your TM1 events are stored in - this should     match the index name defined in the TA
    e. Restart Splunk Enterprise
    f. Allow time for the tm1s.cfg files to be ingested, then navigate to search>reports and execute the ""Run Once-Setup Search"".  This search will populate the lookup table used to drive the user inputs, for selecting the desired TM1 instances.  For more details, please see section 


Lookup Table Maintenance and TM1 Instance Mapping
-There are two lookup tables in use by this app, instance_lookup.csv and process_lookup.csv


The process_lookup.csv
a.  The process_type lookup table is used for enriching searches within the dashboards, such as successful/failed loads, successful/failed exports, and so on.  Since the naming of these TIâ€™s can be arbitrary, Splunk is not able to identify whether a process is a load, export, transfer, etc and relies upon a lookup table to perform this function.  By default, this lookup table is configured to work with the sample data as an example.
b. The following column names are used:
    1.  Process_type
    2.  Examples of  possible entires include Load, Transfer, Export, Maintenance, Close Cycle, etc.
c.  Business_process_name
    1.  This is the friendly name of the TI process
d.  Process_Name
    1.  This field is used for matching purposes with the raw Splunk searches.  The interesting TI name should be defined in this field, and it should match the field name retrieved from the raw data.

The instance_lookup.csv
a.  The instance_lookup table is used for enriching the log data with the TM1 instance name, from which the logs were obtained.  It also drives the tm1_instance selection options in the dashboard UI.  Proper configuration of this table is important as it is leveraged by all of the dashboard panels.  It functions as an automatic lookup, and is intended to map the ServerName field from the tm1s.cfg file with the LogDirectory (should a value be present), and if a value is not present, mapping the file path from the DataDirectory to the path the tm1serverlog and tm1processerror log files are obtained from. 
b.  After installing both the TA and the Perficient Splunk Plus for TM1 app, the setup search under the saved searches view should be run.  When configured properly, it will extract all of the ServerName values from the tm1s.cfg files and the associated LogDirectory or DataDirectory values, and construct the lookup table.  In the event that this is not possible, you may manually edit the lookup table.
c.  The lookup table consists of three columns
    1. cfg_source - this is the source path to the tm1s.cfg file and is present to prevent a conflict of shared directories
    2. tm1_instance - this is the ServerName value of the tm1_instance from which the logs are collected
    3. log_dir - this is the directory which the tm1_instance's tm1server.log and tm1processerror.log files are stored
d.  To manually edit the lookup table, enter a unique value for each cfg_source column, while providing a tm1_instance name, and log_dir paths.

The log_dir path here MUST MATCH the source directory path which the tm1 serverlog and process error files are being ingested from!

The Upgrade Readiness App checks for:
-   Python 3 incompatible code in custom Mako templates.
-   Python scripts that might fail in Python 3.
-   Lower versions of jQuery prior to jQuery 3.5.
-   Templates and dashboards with versions lower than 1.1.
-   References to JavaScript files that Splunk software does not support.
In clustered environments, the app performs these checks on search heads and indexers and provides a merged report with remediation steps.
Which apps does the scan include
This app scans all apps and add-ons in the  $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps  and  $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/slave-apps  directories, with some exceptions. The app scans private apps that you have created for your own organization, as well as public apps installed from Splunkbase, including third-party apps and Splunk supported apps.
Python version switch on Splunk Cloud Platform
On the Splunk Cloud Platform version of the app, the Python Version tab is enabled by default for the  sc_admin  role. This lets Splunk Cloud Platform admins see the current default Python version of the cluster and, if the default version is Python 2, request an upgrade to Python 3. All upgrade requests made by the user are listed on the page.
When you request an upgrade from Python 2 to Python 3, the application sends a request to Splunk Support to upgrade the default version of Python across the entire cluster
Install the Upgrade Readiness App
Install the Upgrade Readiness App on all instances of your Splunk platform deployment that run apps or on a single test Splunk platform instance with all your apps installed on it.
The Upgrade Readiness app is installed by default on Splunk Enterprise version 8.2 and higher. If you are on a Splunk Enterprise version prior to 8.2 but after 7.3, you can download the Python Upgrade Readiness App from Splunkbase and install it on your deployment.
The Upgrade Readiness app is installed by default on Splunk Cloud Platform version 8.2.2107 and higher. You do not need to install or update the app on Splunk Cloud Platform.
Requirements

Splunk Enterprise version 7.3, 8.0, 8.1, or 8.2, or Splunk Cloud Platform version 8.2.2107 or higher.
Installed apps or add-ons.
KV store must be enabled.
A role must hold the  admin_all_objects  capability to install the app on Splunk Enterprise. The admin role holds this capability by default.
Consider increasing the splunkd session timeout value, depending on the number of custom apps in the environment.

Install the app on a search head cluster
To install the app on a search head cluster, use the deployer. For detailed instructions, see  Use the deployer to distribute apps and configuration updates  in the  Distributed Search  manual.
Performance considerations
The Upgrade Readiness App generates a final report that includes all apps after a few cycles of scanning.
On Splunk Enterprise, since the app scanning process runs asynchronously, there is no visible impact on the performance of standalone instances.
On Splunk Cloud Platform, apps that exist only on the remote location do not immediately appear in scan results. All data from all apps on the remote instance will be available in the final merged report after a few scans.
Note that the user session timeout limit is 60 minutes by default. To ensure the user session does not timeout during the app scan, increase the session timeout limit before scanning large numbers of apps, as mentioned in the requirements section.
Manage permissions for the Upgrade Readiness App
After you install the Upgrade Readiness App, you must grant permissions to any roles other than admin that you want to allow to run scans.
Prerequisite
To edit app permissions in Splunk Enterprise, your role must hold the  admin_all_objects  capability. The admin role holds this capability by default. To edit app permissions in Splunk Cloud Platform, you must have the  sc_admin  role.
To grant permission to roles to run scans:
1.  In Splunk Web, click the Apps gear icon.
2.  In the row for the Splunk Python Upgrade Readiness App, click  Permissions.
3.  Under App permissions, select the check box under  Write  for all roles that you want to grant permission to run scans.
4.  Click  Save.
Scan a Splunk platform instance with the Splunk Upgrade Readiness App
Prerequisites
To run scans, a role must hold the  admin_all_objects  capability. See  Manage permissions for the Upgrade Readiness App. Also ensure that the KV store is enabled.
Make sure to take performance factors into consideration. See  Install the Upgrade Readiness App.
The Upgrade Readiness App no longer supports manual scans.
To scan your Splunk platform instance:
1.  The Upgrade Readiness App automatically scans all apps daily by default. The Python scan runs at 1 AM, and the jQuery scan runs at 4 PM. Scan results appear automatically after the scan completes.
2.  Review the scan results for each app in the Python and jQuery tabs.
3.  (Optional) Click  Export Results  to export your scan results. You can choose to export in JSON format.
4.  (Optional) Click  Email Result  to email your scan results. Make sure to configure email settings.
5.  Dismiss any failed files in your private applications if you want to mark it as an exception.
You can also run scans using the REST API. For more information, see the  REST API reference for the Upgrade Readiness App.
Some Splunk apps are too large to scan. If you cannot scan a Splunk app, refer to the app's documentation for updates.
Schedule a scan
The Upgrade Readiness App scans all apps daily by default. The Python scan runs at 1 AM, and the jQuery scan runs at 4 PM. You can modify the app scan schedule, as follows:
1.  In Splunk Web, launch the Upgrade Readiness App.
2.  Select either the Python or jQuery tab to modify that scheduled scan.
3.  Click  Manage Scan Schedule.
4.  Select  Scan my apps on a custom schedule, then specify the scan interval.
5.  Click  Save.
The scan schedule applies to both local search heads and remote indexers.
Disable the scan
You can disable the scan at any time, as follows:
1.  Click  Manage Scan Schedule.
2.  Select  Turn Scan Off.
3.  Click  Save.
    Your request is saved to the KV store, but the schedule change can take up to 2 hours to be reflected on the indexing tier.
After you disable the scan, you must explicitly enable it to rerun the scan at the defined interval. Changing the schedule in the Manage Scan Schedule dialog does not reenable the scan. Any modification to the scan schedule will be reflected on indexers (remote instances) and search heads (local instances) after 2 hours.
Disable app list updates
The Upgrade Readiness App pulls Splunkbase apps and metadata daily 7 minutes past every 8th hour. You can disable automatic app list updates, as follows:
1.  Click  Settings > Data inputs > Scripts.
2.  Find the  pura_get_all_apps.py  script in  python_upgrade_readiness_app.
3.  Click  Disable.
Disabling app list updates applies to standalone instances and not to Splunk Cloud Platform.
Act on Python scan results with the Upgrade Readiness App
After you scan your Splunk platform instance with the Upgrade Readiness app, you can review and act on the results to prepare your deployment for Python 3.
Public Apps
Review and act on the scan results for all of your public apps. Public apps are apps that are available on Splunkbase.
The Upgrade Readiness App scan results of public apps include Splunk-supported apps and third-party apps supported by partners and developers. App owners are responsible for updating their apps and releasing new versions that meet the upgrade readiness requirements of the Splunk Enterprise Python 3 release.
If you've extended an app or customized anything locally, review the results for any custom file paths that you've added to that app and take action on those to prepare for the upgrade. Otherwise, you can wait for the app owner to make updates.
For third-party apps, you can contact the developer directly using their contact details on Splunkbase to learn more about their upgrade plans. If the developer does not plan to update the app, you can make the updates yourself using the guidance in the private scan checks.
If you have a version of a public app that is not compatible with Splunk Enterprise 8.0 and higher and Python 3, but a compatible version is available, then the scan results will direct you to download that version from Splunkbase to pass the check.
The Public App status will fail and display a warning icon for any public app that does not have a version available in the splunkbase.csv list. This list is shipped with the app and updated at 7 minutes past every 8th hour in a sync to Splunkbase. In the event that a connection to Splunkbase fails, the most recent or the shipped .csv will be used in respective order as a failsafe.
Private apps
Review and act on the scan results for all of your private apps. Private apps are apps that are private to your organization and not available on Splunkbase.
Resolve blocking issues in your private apps and your customized Splunkbase apps, if any, as these will block successful upgrade to the Splunk Enterprise Python 3 release. Check all other file paths flagged by the app and determine what actions you must take to make them upgrade ready.
If one or more checks in an app is marked ""SKIPPED"", this means that the Upgrade Readiness App wasn't able to complete the check due to the way the app is packaged. You can repackage the app using the Splunk Packaging Toolkit and run the scan again, or check for the upgrade compatibility issues manually. For more information, see  Overview of the Splunk Packaging Toolkit  on the Splunk developer portal.
Apps that are compatible with Splunk Enterprise 8.0 and higher, and Python 3, are marked as ""PASSED"", and you might not need to take any further action. It is still recommended to test the app thoroughly.
Update Mako templates
In the Splunk Enterprise Python 3 release, some app server components of Splunk Web will use the Python 3.7 interpreter. Update all Mako templates to be Python 3 compatible so they will work on Splunk Web in the new release. If you want the app to continue to work on previous Splunk platform releases, make the syntax dual compatible with Python 2 and 3. If your organization requires you to remove Python 2 syntax completely by a certain date, you can rewrite the Mako templates to use dual-compatible syntax as an intermediate step during your upgrade process, then rewrite them to use Python 3 syntax at a later time.
Update all other Python files
The Splunk Enterprise Python 3 release will initially include interpreters for both Python 2 and 3. In that release, for all Python code not dependent on Splunk Web or the app server, Splunk platform administrators can choose to use either interpreter by default and on a script-by-script basis. In a later release, Splunk plans to remove the Python 2 interpreter.
As a best practice, update Python files in your apps to be compatible with both Python 2 and 3 so that they are backwards compatible with previous releases, compatible with either Python interpreter in the Splunk Enterprise Python 3 release, and compatible with future releases when the Splunk platform removes the Python 2 interpreter. If your organization requires you to remove Python 2 syntax completely by a certain schedule, rewrite them using Python 3 syntax.
To make Python scripts dual compatible, use a Python 2/3 compatibility utility such as six, provided by the Python Software Foundation. For more about the six library, see  https://pypi.org/project/six/.
If the Upgrade Readiness App identifies one or more Python scripts that are used in scripted alerts, convert those scripted alerts to custom alert actions. Scripted alerts are deprecated and might not work in future releases of the Splunk platform.
Act on jQuery scan results with the Upgrade Readiness App
After you scan your Splunk platform instance with the Upgrade Readiness app, you can review and act on the results to remove dependencies on lower versions of jQuery from your deployment.
Public Apps
Review and act on the scan results for all your public apps. Public apps are apps that are available on Splunkbase.
The Upgrade Readiness App scan results include Splunk-supported apps and third-party apps supported by partners and developers. App owners are responsible for updating their apps and releasing new versions after removing jQuery vulnerabilities.
If you've extended an app or customized anything locally, review the results for any custom file paths that you've added to that app and take action on those to prepare for the upgrade. Otherwise, you can wait for the app owner to make updates.
For third-party apps, you can contact the developer directly using their contact details on Splunkbase to learn more about their upgrade plans. If the developer does not plan to update the app, you can make the updates yourself using the guidance in the private scan checks.
If you have a version of a public app that is failing, but a compatible version is available on Splunkbase, then the scan results will direct you to download that version from Splunkbase to pass the check.
The Public App status will fail and display a warning icon for any public app that does not have a version available in the splunkbase.csv list. This list is shipped with the app and updated at 7 minutes past every 8th hour in a sync to SplunkbaseIn the event that a connection to Splunkbase fails, the most recent or the shipped .csv will be used in respective order as a failsafe.
Private Apps
Review and act on the scan results for all your private apps. Private apps are apps that are private to your organization and not available on Splunkbase.
Resolve blocking issues in your private apps and your customized Splunkbase apps, if any. Check all other file paths flagged by the app and determine what actions to take to make them upgrade ready.
You can repackage the app using the Splunk Packaging Toolkit and run the scan again, or check for the upgrade compatibility issues manually. See Overview of the Splunk Packaging Toolkit on the Splunk developer portal for more information.
If one or more checks in an app is marked ""SKIPPED"", this means that the Upgrade Readiness App wasn't able to complete the check due to the way the app is packaged. You can repackage the app using the Splunk Packaging Toolkit and run the scan again, or check for the upgrade compatibility issues manually. For more information, see  Overview of the Splunk Packaging Toolkit  on the Splunk developer portal.
Apps that have no jQuery vulnerabilities are marked as ""PASSED"", and you might not need to take any further action. It is still recommended to test the app thoroughly.
Public and Private apps
Review and act on the scan results with methods that apply to both public and private apps.
Dismiss file paths
The Upgrade Readiness App lets you dismiss individual file paths from the scan results. Dismiss file paths after you verify that they have no jQuery vulnerabilities to narrow down the list to files that still require attention.
When you dismiss a file path, you'll be able to see such file in a separate table and they won't be accounted as a failure in subsequent scans.
Dismiss apps
The Upgrade Readiness App lets you dismiss both public and private apps from the scan results. Dismiss apps after you verify that they have no jQuery vulnerabilities to narrow down the list to apps that still require attention.
When you dismiss an app, that app will be marked as an Exception and it won't be accounted as a failure in the subsequent scans. You'll still be able to execute scans on that app and view results.
Reinstating dismissed file
Take one of the following actions if you accidentally dismiss an app or file path and want to reinstate it in future scans:
-   Delete the Upgrade Readiness App from your Splunk platform instance and then reinstall it.
-   Run the following command in the Search & Reporting app to recover all the file paths you have ever dismissed:
    | outputlookup jra_remote_dismiss_file
-   Run the following command in the Search & Reporting app to recover all the apps you have ever dismissed:
    | outputlookup jra_remote_dismiss_app
Disable email notification
The Upgrade Readiness App sends an email notification to the  admin  or  sc_admin  users, which summarizes the count of failed apps during the latest scan. The notification is sent at 6 AM every Monday based on the Splunk system time zone. You can disable email notification, as follows:
1.  In Splunk Web, click  Settings > Data inputs > Script.
2.  Search for the  pura_send_email.py  script in  python_upgrade_readiness_app  and click  Disable.

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4653,2022-01-10,07:21:09 AM,Ivanti Service Manager Add-On for Splunk,,"Dec. 21, 2021","Overview
Ivanti have developed an integration for ISM and Splunk to provide details of Incident, Service Request and Problem records, as well as providing an alert action for using the ISM REST API to create an incident in ISM. The add-on also supports the creation of a Security Incident in ISM if the Security Operations content package has been installed in the target ISM instance.
This Technology Add-On (TA) requires either an API key (2019.3 or later) or username/password of an account capable of querying the REST API implemented in Ivanti ISM 2018.3 and later.
An accompanying app - the Ivanti ISM App for Splunk (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4654/) provides dashboards that visualise the retrieved data and implement the 3 CIM Ticket Management data sets; incident, change and problem.
Requirements
This TA has been developed and tested against the latest release of Splunk available at the time of development: 8.0.4.1. The inputs should work against Ivanti ISM 2019.2 or later. API key authentication requires ISM 2019.3 or later.
Installation
For ingestion of incident/service request/problem data, install the TA on an instance of Splunk Enterprise capable of running modular inputs. Typically this would be a heavy forwarder or Splunk Cloud-hosted Inputs Data Manager (IDM).
Install the Ivanti ISM App for Splunk (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4654/) on search heads for dashboards and CIM-compliant tagging and field aliases.
For the custom alert action that generates an incident in ISM, install the TA on a search head or search head cluster.
For further guidance around ingestion refer to the Splunk 'Getting Data In' (https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Data/Getstartedwithgettingdatain) or Cloud-focused GDI documentation (https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/latest/Admin/IntroGDI).
Configuration
Configure the TA with the URL of your ISM tenant/server and provide either a) an API key for the ISM Rest API or b) the username and password of a user with appropriate rights in ISM. The Service Desk Analyst role should suffice for both polling tickets and creating incidents
To ingest data from ISM, create inputs for the required business object; incidents, service requests or problems. Configure a polling interval to meet your reporting requirements.
When configuring an alert to generate a new incident, a valid employee LoginID must be provided. It is recommended that a generic account e.g. 'splunk.alerts' or 'security.alerts' be created in ISM, rather than the LoginID of a specific user. Note that the Internal Services account cannot be used for the creation of incidents.
To configure an alert action to generate a Security Incident, check the appropriate checkbox when configuring the alert action. This will cause the TA to create an instance of the new (2020) Security Incident business object rather than the standard Incident object.
Configuration workflow in ISM

Create an API key (recommended over the use of username/password)
If using the TA for alerting, create a generic account to be used for new incidents created from Splunk (recommended over using an existing user account)

Configuration workflow in Splunk - Ingestion

Install the TA
Browse to the TA in Splunk Web and select the Configuration tab, then Add-On Settings
Provide the Tenant URL e.g. https://apacdemo1-try.saasitau.com. Include the protocol (http/https) and port if non-standard
Provide either an API key (e.g. 1A8AE0B10C95FE8C135464F5ED38FBFA) or Username and Password
Provide the Role if not using API key for authentication
Leave the box checked for server certificate verification unless absolutely required e.g. targeting against a test instance with a self-signed cert
Go to the Inputs tab and setup one or more inputs e.g.
Create New Input
Name: acme_ism_incidents
Interval: 600
Index: ISM (any valid Splunk index can be used)
Parameters - leave as the default a different filter is required. The default filter for incidents, for example, queries the state of all Active and Logged incidents
Wait for the first poll then view results by either using the ISM App (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4654/) or searching manually e.g. index=main sourcetype=ivanti:ism:incident

Configuration workflow in Splunk - Alert creation
Create a new alert (Splunk Enterprise) or configure a new alert as an Adaptive Response action in a Correlation Search (Enterprise Security).
Troubleshooting
Use the add-on's UI to configure a logging level of Debug when troubleshooting.
Search using index=_internal sourcetype=""taivantiism:log"" to see errors logged by the ISM TA during ingestion.
Search using index=_internal source=""create_an_incident_in_ism_modalert.log"" to see errors logged by the alert action.

This repo contains a FreeNAS app for Splunk®
FreeNAS
http://www.freenas.org/
FreeNAS is a powerful, flexible home storage system – configured by you, for your needs.
Note - This should also work for a vanilla FreeBSD host, and FreeNAS 10 but only basic testing done
ZFS
The Z File System, or ZFS , is an advanced file system designed to overcome many of the major problems found in previous designs. 
Splunk®
Free Splunk Download Link
Splunk Enterprise is the leading platform for real-time operational intelligence. When you download Splunk Enterprise for free, you get a Splunk Enterprise license for 60 days that lets you index up to 500 megabytes of data per day.
When the free trial ends, you can convert to a perpetual Free license or purchase an Enterprise license to continue using the expanded functionality designed for multi-user deployments.
Dashboards
System Info
This Dashboard contains information on the FreeNAS system(s)


Inputs
For this app to work completely the REST API Modular Input is required, install the REST app first (thanks to the awesome Damien Dallimore)
FreeNAS API
http://api.freenas.org/index.html
This app utilises the FreeNAS api for some data.
Check either inputs.conf, or if you are a novice you can just change the details in the “data inputs” section of Splunk.
You will need to configure for your environment;

Your FreeNAS IP address or host name
Your FreeNAS ROOT password (currently the FreeNAS API only allows the root user)

.SH files
There are several .sh scripts in /TA-SH_files_for_FreeNAS directory that need to be placed on a persistent dataset on the FreeNAS server with a cron job associated with them, set to run every few minutes.
https://doc.freenas.org/9.3/freenas_tasks.html
these scripts output to “logger” - which is the syslog output
Also once copied over this command may be your friend :)
chmod 777 foo.sh
Syslog
You need to configure FreeNAS to log to a central server (Splunk®) for the data to be ingested, point to port 1514 e.g. 
192.168.1.2:1514

https://doc.freenas.org/9.3/freenas_system.html#general
Local Weather input - REST api (Optional)
To compare local temps with system temps I added a json API input via openweathermap
Its free to signup - edit inputs.conf with your location information and appid (API key)
VERY IMPORTANT NOTE
This app is work in progress

This app is for dashboard designers who want to visualize process data on a dashboard panel
How does this app work?
The app generates a Direct-Follows-Graph (DFG) representation of the input data. This is done by computing how often which tasks follow directly after another and representing it accordingly. On top, it calculates summary statistics on the time spent in a task. 
Examples
Example dashboards provided with the app for usage reference. Generally, the modular visualization expects the process data to be supplied in the following format: |table corrID fromStep toStep fromStep Duration. This means that the process data needs to be transformed into this edge representation where each row in the results represents a transition instance. Transition instances that belong to the same process instance are grouped by corrID.
Installation
This app is intended to be installed on the search tier of your deployment only. Please refer to the Splunk Documentation for details.

Contained within the app are dashboards, lookups and a macro.
The 4 dashboards show -

which gaming rigs have sent data to Splunk within the last 24 hours
real time ""In Car"" details as the car goes around the track. This dashboard can be reached by clicking the game rig in the previous dashboard.
raw telemetry generated by F1 2019 add-on
F1 2019 add-on performance by counting processed events by source, port and host

The lookups enrich the F1 2019 data with additional information such as driver names, team names, track names, etc. Lookups created are based on f1-2019-telemetry packets.py version 1.1.4 which in turn is based on Codemasters F1 2019 UDP Specification including the following exceptions -

lookups with 2 or less rows have not been created
f1_2019_driverId with driverId(s) 100-121 as ""Not Set""
f1_2019_nationality with nationality Id 0 as ""Not Set""

The macro decodes which buttons in the game have been pressed.
The app is designed to be minimal to show example F1 2019 data appearing within Splunk.
Assumptions
The F1 2019 app assumes that all gaming rigs can be uniquely identified with a combination of UDP telemetry port, IP name/address of gaming rig, and data collection IP name/address. If any gaming rigs have the same IP name/address and data collection IP name/address combination ensure the UDP telemetry ports are different for each gaming rig. If this is not possible then the SPL will need to be reworked to consider the header.sessionUID field.
Splunk Setup
After the the app has been installed please restart Splunk.

This App searches and analyzes Cisco Bugs, helps to mitigate risks and allows to make well-considered upgrade and migration decisions.
This app takes a CSV export from Cisco Bug Search (https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/) as input.
The setup is very easy and only takes a few minutes: https://youtu.be/zMPh0PY7mRQ
Requirements

Cisco Login to access Cisco Bug Search (https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/)
Excel to convert XLS to CSV
Splunk Enterprise (free trial will be enough)

Installation

Install Splunk Enterprise
Login to Cisco Bug Search (https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/)
Search for your product, do not apply any filters.
Export Results to Excel.  If you get an error ""the list exceeds the maximum of 10,000 results"" then apply some filters or export them in parts (for example first Fixed, then Open, Terminated and Other).                                                                                                                                  
Open the bugsearch.xls file in Excel and export it in CSV UTF-8 format. Do it for every XLS and merge all CSV into one file (Linux: cat bugsearch_Open.csv bugsearch_Fixed.csv > ASA.csv, Windows: type bugsearch_Open.csv bugsearch_Fixed.csv > ASA.csv)
Login in Splunk and install this App (click on the dropdown list of apps top left > Manage Apps > Install app from file)
Launch this app (select ""Cisco Bug Search and Analytics"" in the dropdown list top left)
Import the CSV file:
Setting > Add Data > Upload > Select File > Next
Select sourcetype ""cisco:bugs:csv"" from the dropdown list of sourcetypes
Click Next > Next > Review > Submit > Start Searching



Working with Cisco Bug Search and Analysis App

Use the ""Source"" dropdown to choose your source. Use filters to find a particular infomation that you need.
Try to find a workaround for a similar issue in old releases.
If you're looking to make your systems more stable and secure, check if there are any components or conditions which are responsible for a large portion of problems. For example disabling unimportant components or reducing the load can help avoid some kinds of bugs.
Some software packages are notoriously insecure and have bad historical records.
Complexity is bad: complex code is buggy more often, and buggy code is often insecure. (Thinking Security by Steven M. Bellovin)
Bug Severity: 1 - Catastrophic, 2 - Severe, 3 - Moderate, 4 - Minor, 5 - Cosmetic, 6 - Enhancement. More at https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/bst/bsthelp/index.html
Bug Status: Other - The bug is a duplicate of another bug, Terminated - A decision was made not to fix the bug. More at https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/bst/bsthelp/index.html

Compatibility
This app should work with Splunk 7.x/8.x on Windows and Linux platforms.
TODO
Improve UI and add some advanced features.
Version History

0.0.4 - added timeline filtering (min/max version)
0.0.3 - added new bug timeline view
0.0.2 - easier configuration by using single sourcetype (cisco:bugs:csv). Changing between products by choosing source instead of sourcetype. Added a new view ""vulnerabilities"", removed ""top bugs"", ""analytics"" and ""bug tagging"". Still a beta release.
0.0.1 - first public release (beta)

Ivanti have developed an integration for ISM and Splunk to provide details of Incident, Service Request and Problem records
This app provides dashboards that visualise the retrieved data and implement the 3 CIM Ticket Management data sets; incident, change and problem.
An accompanying Technology Add-On (TA) uses ISM's REST API to ingest events, and provides an alert action to create a new incident.
Requirements
This app has been developed and tested against the latest release of Splunk available at the time of development: 8.0.4.1. The app should work on Splunk 7.x without any issues.
Installation
Install the Ivanti ISM App for Splunk on search heads for dashboards and CIM-compliant tagging and field aliases.
For ingestion of incident/service request/problem data, install the ISM TA (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4653/) on an instance of Splunk Enterprise capable of running modular inputs. Typically this would be a heavy forwarder or Splunk Cloud-hosted Inputs Data Manager (IDM).
For the custom alert action that generates an incident in ISM, install the ISM TA on a search head or search head cluster.
Configuration
Ensure that users of the app are members of a role configured to search, by default, the relevant index containing ivanti:ism* events.

Outcold Solutions provide solutions for monitoring Kubernetes, OpenShift and Docker clusters in Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud. We offer Splunk applications, which give you insights across all containers environments. We are helping businesses to reduce complexity related to logging and monitoring by providing easy-to-use and deploy solutions for Linux and Windows containers. We deliver applications to help developers monitor their applications and operators to keep their clusters healthy. With the power of Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud, we offer a unique solution to help you keep all the metrics and logs in one place, allowing you to quickly address complex questions on container performance and cluster health. 
Description
We provide solutions for monitoring Kubernetes, OpenShift and Docker clusters in Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud. With 10 minutes setup, you will get a monitoring solution, that includes log aggregation, performance and system metrics, metrics from the control plane and application metrics, a dashboard for reviewing network activity, and alerts to notify you about cluster or application performance issues.
All our solutions are powered by the Collectord, a container-native software built by Outcold Solutions that provides capabilities for discovering, transforming and forwarding logs, collecting system metrics, collecting metrics from the control plane of the orchestration frameworks and forwarding network activity. Collectord provides flexible and powerful tools for transforming logs. With our software you can hide sensitive information from the loglines before forwarding them. With Collectord you can reduce the licensing costs associated with logging aggregation by choosing which data you want to forward from the log streams. Collectord forwards container logs, host logs and can discover logs written by the containerized applications.
Use cases
Application Monitoring
See detailed metrics from containers and processes, including performance metrics, utilization metrics and security insights. Forward application-specific metrics, exported in Prometheus format. Use prebuilt Splunk dashboards for a comprehensive overview.
Log Aggregation
Aggregate logs from containers, applications, and servers. Use flexible mappings to filter logs enriched with container metadata, correlate logs with metrics, and leverage Splunk capabilities for analyzing logs. Use Collectord to transform logs before they reach Splunk, remove sensitive information, remove PII data to help keep your logs GDPR compliant. With Collectord you can reduce licensing and storage costs by choosing which loglines you want to forward.
Cluster Health Monitoring
Diagnose cluster issues by looking at historical events, monitoring allocations, and regulating cluster capacity. Leverage pre-built alerts for monitoring the health of the clusters out of the box.
Security and Audit
Define access to the data by clusters, namespaces and even pods or containers. Review network activities, happening inside your cluster, and outside connections. Verify containers running with elevated security permissions. Use audit logs for monitoring changes in deployments.
Reduce complexity and improve productivity
Use one tool to collect and forward logs and metrics required by developers for reviewing performance and health of their applications. With the annotations developers can define how they want to see the data in log aggregation tool, specify multiline log patterns, removing terminal escape codes, override types, sources and indexes.

This add-on exports your Splunk search results to remote destinations so you can do more with your Splunk data. It provides search commands and alert actions to export/push/upload/share your data to multiple destinations of each type. The app must be configured via the Setup dashboard before using it. The setup dashboard includes a connection test feature in the form of a ""Browse"" action for all file-based destinations.
Supported Export Formats

JSON
Raw Text
KV Pairs
Comma-Delimited (CSV)
Tab-Delimited (TSV)
Pipe-Delimited

File-Based Destinations

AWS S3-Compatible Object Storage  (S3, Google Cloud Storage, MinIO)  
Box.com Cloud Storage  
Windows/SMB File Shares  
SFTP Servers  

Streaming Destinations

Splunk HTTP Event Collector  

Credential Management
Use the Credentials tab to manage usernames, passwords, and passphrases (used for private keys) within the Splunk secret store. Certain use cases (such as private key logins) may not require a password, but Splunk requires one to be entered anyway. For passphrases, type any description into the username field. OAuth credentials such as those for AWS use the username field for the access key and the password field for the secret access key. Due to the way Splunk manages credentials, the username field cannot be changed once it is saved.  
Authorization via Capabilities
Add read capabilities for each command to users who require access to use the search command or alert action. Add write capability to allow them to make changes to the configuration. By default, admin has full access and power has read-only access. Credential permissions must be granted separately, but are required to use each command that depends on them.

Click on ""Setup"" button under Actions section for ""Cisco ACI Add-on for Splunk Enterprise""
It will open a setup screen which facilitates user to configure APIC and MSO in Splunk.

The tabs for the above case is explained below:


Configure APIC:

This tab provides 3 different modes to collect the APIC data in Splunk. The common fields are APIC Hostname or IP address and APIC Port (optional). 

The different modes are:


Password Based Authentication

The user can configure the app using the default approach i.e. using Password.
To setup APIC with Password Based Authentication, follow the below given steps.
On the setup screen, enable ""Password Based Authentication"" checkbox.
Enter APIC hostname or IP address of the APIC
Enter the port of the APIC. ex:8000(this step is optional)
Enter username and password which is used to login to the APIC.
Click on the Save button at the bottom of the page.



Certificate Based Authentication

The user needs to provide Certificate Name (as uploaded on APIC) and Path of RSA Private Key (path to the RSA private key, present on Splunk, of the certificate uploaded on APIC) on the setup page to collect data.
The procedure to create and configure a custom certificate for certificate based authentication is given in below link:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/aci/apic/sw/4-x/basic-configuration/Cisco-APIC-Basic-Configuration-Guide-401/Cisco-APIC-Basic-Configuration-Guide-401_chapter_011.pdf

For Password Based Authentication and Remote User Based Authentication:

Provide credentials from setup page.
passwords.conf file will be created in TA_cisco-ACI/local folder with sample stanza : [credential:x.x.x.x:<apic/mso>,<port>,<user>,True:].
Here, the default value of SSL verification will be True.
Change this value from True to False.
Restart Splunk.



For Certificate Based Authentication:

Provide credentials from setup page.
cisco_aci_server_setup.conf file will be created in TA_cisco-ACI/local folder with sample stanza : [cisco_aci_server_setup_settings,x.x.x.x].
Here, the default value of the cisco_aci_ssl parameter will be True.
Change this value from True to False.
Restart Splunk.



This app supports multiple APIC/MSO entries. Provide more ACI credentials through the setup screen. Configure a maximum of 5 APICs for better performance.

For Password Based Authentication and Remote User Based Authentication, Splunk REST API will encrypt the password and store it in the app itself(local/passwords.conf) in encrypted form.

For Certificate Based Authentication, certificate name, and path to the private key will be stored in the app itself(local/cisco_aci_server_setup.conf). 
The data collector script will fetch these credentials through the REST API to connect to the APIC.


APIC Hostname or IP address once configured to any 3 modes of authentication, cannot be configured through the remaining 2 modes of authentication.


Also, users can setup APIC either using any one of the three modes of authentication or all the three modes one by one but for different APICs.


Example: User can either setup only APIC1 using Password/Remote/Certificate Based Authentication.
                          OR
  Users can setup APIC1 for Password Based Authentication, APIC2 for Remote User Based Authentication and APIC3 for Certificate Based Authentication.


Note: APIC Hostname or IP address once configured to any 3 modes of authentication, cannot be configured through the remaining 2 modes of authentication.


Whenever the user wants to change the credentials, he/she needs to remove the current entry from directory TA_cisco-ACI/local/passwords.conf or TA_cisco-ACI/local/cisco_aci_server_setup.conf first.
   Restart Splunk. Provide the credentials through UI.


MSO Hostname or IP address once configured to any one of the modes of authentication, cannot be configured through the remaining 2 modes of authentication.


Also, users can setup MSO either using any one of the two modes of authentication or all the two modes one by one but for different MSOs.


Example: Users can either setup only MSO1 using Password Based Authentication.
                          OR
  Users can setup MSO1 for Password Based Authentication and MSO2 for Remote User Based Authentication.


Whenever the user wants to change the credentials, he/she needs to remove the current entry from directory TA_cisco-ACI/local/passwords.conf first. Restart Splunk. Provide the credentials through UI.


Note: The hostname configured by APIC, cannot be re-configured for MSO and vice versa.


Example: If the user can only configure host1 for APIC and host2 for APIC and not host1 for both APIC and MSO.


User also needs to modify ""default/inputs.conf"" according to the following guidelines.


inputs.conf
This file contains filename paths which are different based on your OS platform. 
The app is configured out of the box to work for Unix/Linux/macOS systems. 
If you are running this app on a Windows system, perform the following steps:
  Copy the file ""default/inputs.conf.WINDOWS"" to ""local/inputs.conf""

Each entry in default/input.conf contains a field ""passAuth"" with default value admin. This field can contain any splunk user with admin rights.

Add More Data to Splunk

Data Inputs (in inputs.conf) can be added/modified either from the setup page or directly from the backend (as mentioned above)

Setup Page
Following options are provided on the setup page under the tab ""Configure Data Inputs"" for modifying data inputs in inputs.conf:
  * Type: Following eight types are allowed in Add-on
    * authentication: To get the authentication information from the ACI environment.
    * classInfo: To get the general information for all the MOs of given APIC classes.
    * cloud: To get the details related objects for all the MOs of given APIC classes.
    * health: To get the health and fault information for all the MOs of given APIC classes.
    * fex: To get the health and fault information for all the MOs of given APIC classes.
    * microsegment: To get the general information for all the MOs of given APIC classes.
    * stats: To get the statistical data for all the MOs of given APIC classes.
    * mso: To get details of various MSO endpoints.
  * Arguments:  Names of APIC classes for which data will be fetched (Names of classes are case-sensitive) or names MSO API endpoints.
  * Interval: Time interval (in seconds) at which data inputs will be scheduled to collect data, once enabled.
  * Enable/Disable: Status representing whether the data input is enabled or not.
  * Actions:
    * Edit:
      * Add/Remove/Modify the existing APIC classes or MSO endpoints.
      * Change time interval of data inputs.
      * Change status of data inputs i.e. enabled/disabled.
      * Click on Add button (under Actions).
    * Delete
      * This button will directly delete data input.
  * Add New Button: It will add new data input in inputs.conf. Again, the user will have the choice for all actions stated above.
  * Click on save button after making changes.
Note- Any change performed by the user will be reflected in default/inputs.conf and local/inputs.conf.
How to enable collector scripts

Enable Data collector Scripts. By default Scripts are disabled. Enable through UI (Settings -> Data inputs -> Local inputs-> Scripts).
Enable the collector scripts labeled under the app name: TA_cisco-ACI
The user can also enable scripts from Setup Page (as mentioned above)

Create your own index:
* The app data defaults to the 'main' index.
* If you need to specify a particular index for your APIC data, for ex. ""apic"",create an indexes.conf file [sample shown in ($SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA_cisco-ACI/default/indexes.conf.sample)]
* Once you specify your index, edit the inputs.conf file and add a line ""index=[yourindex]"" under each script stanza.

TEST YOUR INSTALL / TROUBLESHOOTING
The main app dashboard can take some time before the data is returned which will populate some of the panels. A good test to see that you are receiving all of the data we expect is to run this search after several minutes:
index=""<your index>"" | stats count by sourcetype


Troubleshooting APIC configuration:
In particular, you should see these sourcetypes:
cisco:apic:health
cisco:apic:stats
cisco:apic:class
cisco:apic:authentication
cisco:apic:cloud



If you don't see these sourcetypes, have a look at the messages output by the scripted input: collect.py. Here is a sample search that will show them:
    index=_internal component=""ExecProcessor"" collect.py ""ACI Error:"" | table _time host log_level message


Troubleshooting MSO configuration:

You should see this sourcetype: cisco:mso
If you don't see this sourcetype, have a look at the messages output by the scripted input: collect_mso.py. Here is a sample search that will show them:
    index=_internal component=""ExecProcessor"" collect_mso.py ""MSO Error:"" | table _time host log_level message

You can also see the $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log file to check if any error has occurred.

This app will index and present temperature data from a raspberry pi using the Dallas DS18B20 temperature sensors.
Getting Started
Prep
First you will need a Raspberry Pi and the DS18B20 sensor(s). I suggest reading this article: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-11-ds18b20-temperature-sensing?view=all
Once you have used the test python script to see temperature data per the Adafruit instructions you are ready to use this app.
Prep the UF
This app will require the install of a Splunk Universal Forwarder on the Raspberry Pi. 
This is how I did it.

Download and scp over the Splunk Universal Forwarder app for the Pi
    a. https://apps.splunk.com/app/1611/
Untar the UF in the /tmp dir
    a. tar zxvf forwarder-for-linux-arm-raspberry-pi_10.tgz 
Move to /opt/
    a. sudo mv splunkforwarder/ /opt/
Create splunk user and assign home dir.
    a. sudo adduser splunk --home /opt/splunkforwarder
Own the directory correctly. 
    a. cd /opt/
    b. sudo chown -R splunk:splunk splunkforwarder/
Start the UF.
    a. sudo su - splunk
    b. ~/bin/splunk start
Set Splunk to start on boot.
    a. sudo /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk enable boot-start -user splunk
Send UF data to your main Splunk Indexer.
    a. ~bin/splunk add forward-server <indexer>:9997 -auth admin:changeme

New Install of the piTemp App
This section is to install on a centralized splunk setup.

Copy this app directory into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ location.  Or install via Splunk UI (recommended).
Look at file default/props.conf for any edits.
Restart the Splunk server.
Install the TA app onto your raspberry pi running the splunk UF.
    a. The TA is under the appserver/addons/ directory.
Update the lookup table to map a friendly name to your sensors in lookups/.
    a. lookups/probenames.csv
    b. You will need to know the ID numbers of your sensors.

Distributed HA Splunk environment
For those who are running a distributed Splunk design or HA: ie separate forwarders, search heads, indexers, etc... Please follow these directions.  Depending on your design YMMV.  Please see this link for more instructions:  [http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/Overview/Installingadd-ons]

Install this app on your Search Head(s) and Indexer(s).

Upgrading this app

Run the upgrade via the Splunk App management UI.
Restart Splunk.

Notes
Temperature data will be stored into the main index of splunk. It will be set to sourcetype ""piTemp"".
Example log format is:

2015-01-28 14:16:40.749933 raspberrypi get_temp.py[20202]: sensor=28-000005abea5d, temp_c=18.0, temp_f=64.4, temp_raw=18000.0

What's in 1.0.1!

Minor, very minor, updates.

What's in 1.0!
New app!

Works with Splunk 6.0 and up.

ConfigurationYou are able to send alert data to up to 3 separate Swimlane instances with each action.  This is provided so you canconveniently push to produciton, staging, and development instances with one action.The global configuration is where you will define the connection info and credentials for your Swimlane instances.1. In the top left corner of the Splunk interface, open the *app* dropdown menu and select the *Swimlane* app.2. You will see the configuration page where you can define the host, username, and password for up to 3 Swimlane instances.Alert Configuration1. Once you have created an alert, go to the alert page and click *Edit* next to the *Actions* field.2. At the bottom of the window, select *Add Actions* -> *Push Alerts to Swimlane*, then fill out the fields appropriately. Setup instructions for `Custom Field Mappings` and `Automappings` are in the next section Mapping configurationFor the initial setup, use `Automapping`.1. In the Swimlane application, Create a JSON field with the *field key* `splunkrawjson` and a multi-line text field with the *field key* `splunkfieldlist`.  These two fields can be used to see the data being pushed to Swimlane.2. Trigger the alert so that the action runs, then check Swimlane to make sure records were created inthe desired application.  if no records were created, check the logs (described in the **Logging** sectionbelow) to debug.3. Open one of the records that was created in Swimlane.  The fields in `splunkfieldlist` are the fields that areavailable for mapping.  You can use `splunkrawjson` to see the value each field contains.4. For each field that you want to push to Swimlane, either use `Automappings` or `Custom Field Mappings` asdescribed below.If you select to use `automapping`, Splunk fields will populate a Swimlane field with the same field key ifit exists.  This is the preferred method of mapping since you can still display the info however you want in Swimlane by setting the field display name.All Swimlane field types are supported and Splunk fields containing lists will be properly translated intolist type fields in Swimlane.LoggingTo find logs in the Splunk search, use the following search string:index=_internal OR index=cim_modactions OR index=* source=""*push_alerts_to_swimlane_modalert.log""To access the log file directly, it can be found at:{Splunk root folder}/var/log/splunk/push_alerts_to_swimlane_modalert.logIf multiple executions happen concurrently, you can distinguish which log message belongs to which execution using the `pid`logged in each messageGeneral logs that Splunk generates can be found by going to *settings* -> *Alert actions*, then clicking on *View log events* for the *Push Events to Swimlane* action.",Version 2.1.2,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/29b44e7c-5e92-11ec-a65f-fa6a1b59a916.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,"1,705",0,splunk,5,1,David Pack,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/swimlane1,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

The Ivanti Device and Application Control App for Splunk provides pre-built dashboards for IDAC data that is imported with the IDAC Add-on for Splunk.
The dashboards in this app expose both statistics and detailed views on all activities - blocks, shadowing, admin audit activity and agent updates.
An accompanying Technology Add-On (TA) provides properties (props.conf) and sample inputs (inputs.conf) to ingest and parse IDAC events.
Requirements
This app has been developed and tested against the latest release of Splunk available at the time of development: 8.1.3. The app should work on Splunk 7.x without any issues.
Installation
Install the Ivanti IDAC App for Splunk on search heads for dashboards and CIM-compliant field aliases.
Edit the idac_index macro to specify which Splunk index is used to store the IDAC event data; by default this macro is set to index=idac.
For ingestion of device control event data, install the IDAC TA (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5532/) where data from IDAC is first parsed - heavy forwarders, or indexers if no heavy forwarder is used between a universal forwarder (on the IDAC server) and the indexing tier.
Configuration
Ensure that users of the app are members of a role configured to search, by default, the relevant index containing ivanti:idac:* events.

Virus Total TA
This app is used to supplement your data with information from VirusTotal.
The custom command | virustotal (bundled with this app) uses the https://www.virustotal.com/vtapi/v2/file/report
endpoint to communicate with the VirusTotal API.
This TA can be installed on the search head. No additional manual steps are required in distributed environments,
as the app only interacts with search-time functionality ( lookups and scheduled searches ).
Getting Started
This app requires set-up. App set-up can be accessed from Splunk's ""Manage Apps"" menu.
The following options should be configured in the set-up menu.

Note: The setup should be ran by an admin user.

For minimum functionality (ad-hoc searches only), the following should be configured:
 - VirusTotal API Key
 - VirusTotal Max Batch Size

Note that without configuring these values, neither the custom command nor the scheduled searches will work.

For full functionality (lookup table caching VT data), the following can also be configured:
 - Enable ""Cache Auto Update""
 - Configure ""Cache Auto Update : Index Filter"" : Provide index and/or other filters indicating where events with hashes can found
 - (optional) Review and customise the cron schedule (directing the frequency of when the internal VT cache is to be refreshed)
 - (optional) Review and customise the ""Earliest time"" for the scheduled search to work with your cron schedule.
For extended cleanup functionality
 - Enable ""Cache Auto Clean""
 - (optional) Review and customise the cron schedule for the search and the retention period for the cache
 - It is recommended that the cleanup search run after (not before) the update search.
Security and Data Exposure
This TA will only ever connect to the VirusTotal REST API endpoint. These connections will only ever be performed over https connections. These connections will only ever be triggered by the explicit invocation of the | virustotal command (either by users or by scheduled searches).
This TA will share certain information with the VirusTotal API. This information is strictly limited to:
 - The VirusTotal API key : Required to authenticate against the VirusTotal API
 - The contents of the field specified when running the | virustotal <hash|url|ip>=FIELD command. (e.g. hash field, url field, or ip field). Note that care should be taken when using the url field. Depending on your data, this field might contain HTTP parameters (e.g. ?very_secret_data=my_secret_password). This TA will not anonymise, remove, nor mutate your data in any way. This could lead to information disclosure. Ensure you understand this risk, or speak to the data owner before using the command. Additionally care should be taken when invoking the VirusTotal command. A careless invocation could result in information disclosure: e.g. | virustotal hash=very_secret_pii_field . This invocation would result in the contents of very_secret_pii_field being sent across the network to the VirusTotal API.
No other information will be sent over the network. No other fields from the event will be sent. No file contents or file names will be uploaded for scanning.
App functionality
Basic Functionality
The virustotal command can be used in SPL. The command accepts two arguments - usage of hash=<field> will be described now, and usage of rescan=<bool> will be described later in this document.
This argument should be set to the field name of the field that contains hashes in your search.
Example:
index=email_attachments attachment_hash=*
| fields attachment_hash, from
| virustotal hash=attachment_hash
This will force a real-time query to the VirusTotal API and retrieve the most recent data for each hash.
This use of the app is recommended strictly on an ad-hoc basis, as it can be slow and use many API queries.

Should output of the above command not look as expected, check for any warnings/errors in the ""Job"" dropdown and in the search log. This sometimes happens as a result of data quality issues, VT license issues, and other problems.

Proof of Concept: 
| makeresults 
| eval eicar=""131f95c51cc819465fa1797f6ccacf9d494aaaff46fa3eac73ae63ffbdfd8267""
| virustotal hash=eicar

This PoC is fully self-contained (i.e. does not depend on any external data). 

Similar syntax can be used to query other VirusTotal intelligence endpoints like ""url"", ""domain"", and ""ip"" information.
Example:
index=email_attachments source_domain=* target_domain=myorg.com
| fields source_domain, from
| virustotal domain=source_domain
Note that the virustotal command syntax changed slightly from the first to the second example. It now contains domain=source_domain. By using domain= instead of hash=, we are instructing the command to query VT for different information. One of url=, ip=, domain=, or hash= must be used whenever invoking the command. Failure to do this will result in an error. Similarly, if more than one of these options is specified ina  single invocation; this too will result in an error condition.
Caching Support
This TA also comes bundled with the ability to cache VT data into lookup tables. This function requires configuration in app setup.
Once configured, a set of scheduled searches will periodically update several KVStore collections with VT data.
This lookups will contain historical hashes/urls/ips/domains (up to a configured age), and will also have all the most recent relevant hashes.
This method of correlating VT data is much faster than the ad-hoc method described above.
The following lookups are available, and can be configured for automatic population and updating via App Setup:



- virustotal_hash_cache : This lookup can/should be queried by referencing the vt_hashes key. e.g. | lookup virustotal_hash_cache vt_hashes AS <name_of_your_hash_field>




- virustotal_ip_cache : This lookup can/should be queried by referencing the vt_resource key. e.g. | lookup virustotal_ip_cache vt_resource AS <name_of_your_ip_field>


- virustotal_domain_cache : This lookup can/should be queried by referencing the vt_domain key. e.g. | lookup virustotal_domain_cache vt_resource AS <name_of_your_domain_field>



Example:
index=email_attachments attachment_hash=*
| fields attachment_hash, from
| lookup virustotal_hash_cache vt_hashes AS attachment_hash OUTPUT vt_classification, vt_query_time
The drawback of this method is that data within the lookup can potentially be outdated,
as known hashes are only updated at the interval specified in the setup.
Additionally, care should be taken that the scheduled search that populates this lookup is scheduled to run shortly
before any correlations or rules that make use of the lookup. This way, the probability is high that the lookup will have a
chance to pull any required (new) information from VT about previously unseen hashes.
To achieve the best of both approaches, you may use the following SPL snippet:
index=email_attachments attachment_hash=*
| fields attachment_hash, from
| lookup virustotal_hash_cache vt_hashes AS attachment_hash OUTPUT vt_classification, vt_query_time
| virustotal hash=attachment_hash rescan=false
Note the rescan=false flag. This instructs the command not to query VT API for hashes which already have metadata attached.
As such, a majority of hashes will retrieved from lookup, and any hashes that weren't found in the lookup will be supplied real-time.

If the lookup is empty, or some other logical error occurs resulting in failure to supply information from the lookup,
the virustotal command will query VT API for all hashes. This could take a long time and potentially use a very large amount
of API calls. Be sure you understand the risk when using this method.

Detailed command documentation
The | virustotal command supports the following options:

hash= : specify the name of the field which contains file hashes to be scanned against the VT API
url= : specify the name of the field which contains URLs to be scanned against the VT API
ip= : specify the name of the field which contains IP addresses to be scanned against the VT API
domain= : specify the name of the field which contains domains to be scanned against the VT API

Exactly one of these options must be specified when invoking the command. In addition to these options, there are several flags that can be used to further modify the functionality of command.

mode= : can be either json or v1 . If mode json is used, the command will return the full json results returned from VT. This can be used to extract any information using spath and work manually with the highest possible level of verbosity. In v1 mode, the command will return several fields (those deemed to be most valuable but not too verbose by the developers of this TA). v1 is currently the default mode and the only one that works with caching.
rescan : can be true or false. If set to false, any rows that already contain a vt_resource field will not be rescanned against the VirusTotal API.

Advanced functionality
In the 2.0 release of this addon, support was added for an additional output format. By using the mode=json option, the command can be used to retrieve and display raw VirusTotal output in json form. This can be used to retrieve additional information, which is not displayed in the command's standard output. By using the | spath command, the json format can be extracted and further analysed in Splunk. Note that the TA's out-of-the-box caching support does not use the json output, and still relies on the standard fields typically returned by the command.
Manually triggering data onboarding
When running the TA for the first time, there is no need to wait for the scheduled search to execute.
After completing App Setup, simply go into the app, click on the reports tab, and click ""Open in Search"" for the  ""VirusTotal Update Hash Lookup"" row. (or any of the other ""VirusTotal Update * Lookup"" searches)
This search will work its way through your events and build a cache ( KVStore-backed lookup ) of all the hashes, ip addresses, urls, or domain names it has seen.

Depending on the amount of data you have ( in the time-period specified in setup ), and on the VT license/key you are using,
 this could take a significant amount of time to go through all your hashes.

Lookup: virustotal_hash_cache
Fields:
 - vt_resource : Synonymous to the _key of the underlying KVStore collection. Usually the hash.
 - vt_hashes : A MV list of hashes. At this time, typically, has one of each: md5, sha1, sha256. This field is accelerated. All values in this field are lowercase (to support case-insensitive matching). This is the best field to lookup against (e.g. | lookup virustotal_hash_cache vt_hashes AS attachment_hash).
 - vt_query_time : Unix timestamp representing the last time the VT API has been queried for information relating to this hash.
 - vt_classification : This field is the percentage of AVs that detected a threat. This field is typically synonymous to the following arithmetic expression: vt_positives/vt_total*100. Note that this field can also hold a string value of unknown_hash. This means that VT has no information about any files with this hash.
 - vt_scan_date : This is the datetime that VT reports having last scanned this file on their servers.
 - vt_permalink : An HTTPs URL to a human-friendly HTML site about this hash/file. May contain more information about the findings.
 - vt_positives : The number of AntiVirus utilities that identified the file with the given hash as a threat.
 - vt_total : The number of AntiVirus utilities that were used by VT to scan a file with the given hash.
 - vt_threat_av : An MV field of the names of all the AntiVirus utilities that identified the file with this hash as a threat.
 - vt_threat_id : An MV field of the classification names assigned to the perceived threat by AntiVirus utilities listed in vt_threat_av
Lookup: virustotal_url_cache

vt_query_time : Unix timestamp representing the last time the VT API has been queried for information relating to this hash.
vt_classification : This field is the percentage of AVs that detected a threat. This field is typically synonymous to the following arithmetic expression: vt_positives/vt_total*100. Note that this field can also hold a string value of unknown_hash. This means that VT has no information about any files with this hash.
vt_scan_date : This is the datetime that VT reports having last scanned this file on their servers.
vt_permalink : An HTTPs URL to a human-friendly HTML site about this hash/file. May contain more information about the findings.

vt_total : The number of AntiVirus utilities that were used by VT to scan a file with the given hash.
vt_threat_av : An MV field of the names of all the AntiVirus utilities that identified the file with this url as a threat.
vt_threat_id : An MV field of the classification names assigned to the perceived threat by AntiVirus utilities listed in vt_threat_av

Lookup: virustotal_ip_cache

vt_resource : The IP address that this entry pertains to
vt_classification : This does not yield useful threat information like hash/url. Basically can be ""known"" or ""unknown""; referring to whether this was found in VT database or not; but not indicating whether this is a threat.
vt_query_time : the time when this Ip was last checked against VT.
vt_whois : whois information associated with this IP.
vt_asn : Autonomous System Number that owns this IP or its range.

vt_scan_date : The date that VirusTotal last updated this record.

Lookup: virustotal_domain_cache

vt_resource : The domain name that this record refers to. (lower case / case insensitive)
vt_classification : This does not yield useful threat information like hash/url. Basically can be ""known"" or ""unknown""; referring to whether this was found in VT database or not; but not indicating whether this is a threat.
vt_categories : The categories that this site has been identified as containing. e.g. 'search engine', 'adult content', 'gambling', etc.
vt_query_time : the time when this domain was last checked against VT.
vt_detected_communicating_samples : number of samples (executables) that were observed communicating with this domain. (capped at 100)

vt_detected_referrer_samples : ???
vt_detected_urls : number of URLs under this domain that were reported as malicious by at least one VT engine.

Saved Searches
The description of each scheduled search can be found in the app setup. Please ensure you read and understand it before
enabling the saved search
Support
Support will be provided by the developers (ADARMA) on a best-effort basis. The developers make no commitment to continued development. The software is provided as is, and the developer accepts no responsibility for any issues with the software, or which may result as a consequence of using the software.
Known Issues

1 : While running the search, multiple errors occur, each from a different indexer, claiming that ""Application does not exist: TA-VirusTotal""
This issue can happen on several older versions of Splunk. It means that, despite the TA's objections, the command is being run in streaming mode across all indexers. The quick-fix is to use a non-streaming command (e.g | table *) right before the | virustotal command. This will force the remainder of the search to happen on the search head; fixing the issue.

Changelog
2.2.0

thanks to: @edro15 


removed setup.xml & fixed compatibility with Spunk Cloud

2.1.0

Added support for python 3.x
Updated splunklib to latest version
Moved splunklib out of ""bin"" and into ""lib"" as per best-practice

2.0.0
Added support for URL, domain, and IP intelligence (with full support for caching working almost identically to how hash caches have worked since the beginning)
Added support for using a proxy to connect to VirusTotal
Made the | virustotal command available in other apps. (permissions are still restricted to admin users; see metadata/default.meta for more info)  
1.2.3
Added a data-quality warning to warn users that data in their hash field may have issues.  
1.2.0
Added cmd_timeout option to virustotal.conf and the app setup page. This option allows the user to provide a timeout
value. This is a patch intended to provide support for Splunk versions lower than 7.1.0. On those versions,
the search job lifecycle reaches the ""Finalising"" state prematurely, causing the command to terminate before it is
done processing all events. The consequence of correcting for this behaviour, is that the user is unable to manually
""Stop"" the job. The timeout was added to provide the user with the means to specify the maximum running time for the command,
intended to be especially useful in environments where manual stopping is impossible.",Version 2.2.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/ef8f355e-75b7-11eb-89ee-02fa7700cf1c.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,"3,176",0,splunk,4,7,Adarma Security,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/ecssecurity,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

Rewrite of Gemini KV Store Tools
Utilities for the Splunk App Key-Value Store
The KV Store Tools for Splunk app includes the following features:
Generating Commands

KV Store Backup: Backup KV Store collections to the file system on the search head.  
KV Store Restore: Restore KV Store collections from backup jobs[1].  Lists all existing backups in the default path if no arguments are given.
KV Store Push: Copy KV Store collections from the local Splunk search head to a remote instance or comma-separated instance list (SH/SHC)[1].  
KV Store Pull: Copy KV Store collections from a remote Splunk search head (SH/SHC) to the local instance[1].  
Delete Key: Delete KV Store records from a collection based on user input.  

Streaming Commands

Create Foreign Key: Creates an entry in a lookup and appends the resulting _key value to the current search results.  Useful for writing linked entries in two lookups.  
Delete Keys: Delete KV Store records from a collection based on _key values in search results.  

Alert Actions

Send to Collection: Similar to outputlookup, but can be toggled on/off by users that have permissions to edit search jobs without modifying the search. This functionality has been implemented by Splunk directly into the product since this was written.  

[1]: Deletes the collections from the target host before writing (unless otherwise specified).

Manage and Monitor your Cloud Data Providers in Splunk from one centralized data platform.

This Splunk based app relies on the work done by Project Trumpet and the AWS Organizational model.

Grand Central User's Guide :

Version 3.0.5

Getting Started
Amazon Web Services
Requirements
Grand Central works with the AWS Organizations framework and does not require either Landing Zone or Control Tower to work. By having the organization setup with multiple accounts, Grand Central will be able to discover the accounts and add into management within Splunk.
Please refer to the Amazon Web Services documentation on how to get started with Organizations.
Before Deploying Grand Central
You will need to be able to create an IAM User in the Master Account and the sub accounts that will be added into management under Splunk. By default there will be two IAM policies created, one to list all the accounts in the Organization and the second will be a deployment policy.
IAM Role Creation Shortcut (Simplified)
1. Log into your Master AWS Account AWS Account:



Click on Grand Central Create 



Copy the Access Key / Secret Key from CloudFormation Output :



Download grand_central_202.spl file from S3 bucket and install on your Splunk instance. Splunk Cloud customers request to have the app installed. 



Cloudformation Template for IAM User Creation
Here is the Cloudformation template used for this IAM Role Creation : https://github.com/amiracle/grand_central/blob/master/cf_templates/GC_StackSet_UserCreate_CFTemplate.json 
Here is the policy which it will deploy for reference:

IAM Policy - Grand_Central_IAM_Policy.json
Grand Central Policy for Master Account : 
- [GCPolicy_Rev2.json] https://github.com/amiracle/grand_central/blob/master/aws_artifacts/IAM_Policy/GCPolicy_Rev2.json
Use this policy to setup and deploy Grand Central in a Control Tower / AWS Organization deployment. This will use StackSets to deploy configuraiton changes to sub accounts in AWS. 
Individual Account IAM Policy (Optional)

If you are going to use individual accounts and policies in each account, use this IAM policy. 
Grand Central Policy for Individual AWS Accounts :
Grand_Central_IAM_Policy.json

Setting up Grand Central
Adding Master Account
Log into the Grand Central App and navigate to the Accounts Section (Configure Data Sources -> Amazon Web Services -> Grand Central Accounts).

https://yoursplunk.com:8000/en-US/app/grand_central/grand_central_accounts

Click on the “New Organization Master Account” button:

Add the Master Account ID (must be a number) access key / secret key to Splunk:

The Master Account should now show up in Splunk:

Once the Master Account has been added, now you should be able to view the accounts in the organization. Under Actions, navigate to the List All Accounts in the dropdown:

List of all the accounts:

In order to add the discovered accounts into Splunk, select ""Add Accounts in Organization to Grand Central"" in the Actions dropdown:

Click on the Add Button:

All the accounts should now show up under management in Splunk:

Splunk Endpoints
Now, add the destination where you will be sending your data. This is typically a Firehose endpoint on your Splunk Cloud Deployment.
Here is an example of how you should fill out the fields:
Note that if you are using Splunk Cloud the URL for your firehose endpoint should look like this:
https://http-inputs-firehose-mystack.splunkcloud.com:443

BYOL Cloud Deployments
https://mystack.com:8088

AWS Stacksets
Define your AWS Stackset here in Splunk. What will happen is as new accounts are vended into Organizational Units (OU's), they will automatically have these configurations sent to the newly AWS Accounts. Addiontally, if an existing account is moved into an OU, it will be configured with these settings.
Example : Account 987654321 is in the Core OU after being provisioned, then gets moved into the DevOps OU, the AWS Stackset ""grandcentralCloudTrail"" will deploy in that account and setup the CloudTrail data collection.
Deploy an AWS Stackset

Your Splunk Accounts should look like this when you're done:


Pro Tip : For now, create a Splunk HEC token for each sourcetype. E.g. aws:cloudtrail for CloudTrail, aws:config for Config, and aws:cloudwatchlogs:vpcflow for VPCFlow Logs

The legacy Bulk Data Deployment system still works if you do not want to use AWS Stacksets and would rather use Access Key / Secret Keys for each of your accounts. Just follow the steps for the Bulk Credential Upload or set up each account individually. Now you can deploy data collection to all these accounts, click on the Bulk Deployment button and select your accounts, regions, destination and data source:

Click Deploy.
Splunk will communicate with AWS and begin deploying the CloudFormation templates in all the accounts and regions you've selected:
In the Observation Deck dashboard you will see the successfully deployed Accounts and Regions:

About PAVO Vulnerabilities App for Splunk
Overview
This app provides Splunk dashboards, forms, and reports which can be used to explore your vulnerability events, and make sense of what can often be a large volume of data.
To do this, the app relies on the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) for vulnerability events. This means that the app can report on any vulnerability data, as long as it has been on-boarded properly, and is available through the Vulnerabilities data model.
A note on Splunk Data Model Acceleration and Disk Space
This app requires data model acceleration, which will use additional disk space. If you are using the Splunk App for Enterprise Security, this is already enabled, and should have been factored into your retention policies. If not, you should review the documentation on data model acceleration, how it uses disk space, and how to plan for it.
A note on the Splunk Common Information Model
As mentioned above, the app uses the CIM for vulnerability events. The CIM allows you to take events from a number of sources or products, and report on them in one cohesive manner, using a common set of names for fields and event types.
Available Dashboards
Vulnerabilities Overview
This dashboard serves as a jumping-off point for exploring your vulnerability data. It includes panels for vulnerabilities over time, severities, destinations, and signatures. Clicking on panels in this dashboard will drill down to the appropriate profile page for further exploration.
Severity Profile
Form with reports and visualizations built around a set of severities (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational, Unknown, or all).
Dest Profile
Form with reports and visualizations built around a destination (host or IP address, depending on how your CIM information for your vulnerability management events is mapped).
Signature Profile
Form with reports and visualizations built around a signature, such as Terminal Services Encryption Level is Medium or Low or Buffer overrun in NT kernel message handling. Note that this is different than a CVE number, this is the text description of the vulnerability.
Vulnerability Search
Form with many input variables. This is a flexible form designed to help generate a knockout list for fixing a set, or particular type of vulnerability.
Identifier Search
Form for searching based on an identifier for a vulnerability, such as CVE, Cert, MSFT, or other reference number.
<<<<<<< HEAD Prerequisites -
Splunk Versions
This app should be installed on the same search head on which the Vulnerabilities data model has been accelerated.
Splunk Common Information Model Add-on
This app depends on data models included in the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on, specifically the Vulnerabilities data model. Please review the information on installing and using the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on and information on configuring the acceleration on the data model.
The Splunk Common Information Model Add-on can be downloaded from Splunkbase.
This app has been tested with versions 4.X of the CIM add-on.
Data model Acceleration on the Vulnerability data model
In order to make the app respond and load quickly, accelerated data models are used to provide summary data. For this data to be available, the |data_model| data model must be accelerated. Information on how to enable acceleration for the |data_model| data model can be found here. The data model must be accelerated for the length of time for which you would like to see reporting.

https://avinetworks.com/docs/latest/alert-actions/
https://avinetworks.com/docs/latest/notifications-overview/
Getting Events into Splunk requires configuration changes made on the Avi Controller.  To send Avi events into Splunk configure your alert-actions within the Avi Controller to send syslog messages with a destination endpoint being your Splunk infrastructure.
Virtual Service Logs
Virtual Service logs provide realtime in depth L7 application data for each request. The Virtual Service Logs are sent as a JSON payload over UDP.   
https://avinetworks.com/docs/latest/architectural-overview/applications/virtual-services/vs-logs/
https://avinetworks.com/docs/latest/streaming-avi-logs-to-external-server/
Getting Virtual Service Logs into Splunk requires configuration changes made on the Avi Controller.  To send Avi Virtual Service Logs into Splunk configure your anayltics profile to Stream to an External Server, defining your Splunk infrastructure as the server endpoint.
Performance Metrics
Avi provides over 200+ metrics allowing you to monitor not only the peformance of Avi as a service, but granular visibility or specific applications and backend pool servers.
A Scripted Data Input named Avi Metrics is included with the Splunk add-on.  The Avi Metrics Data Input will connect to the specified Avi Controller(s) via the REST API and retrieve the performance metrics. To get performance metrics into Splunk add a new entry within the Avi Metrics data input specifying the Avi Controller cluster and relevant credentials.  The default interval for the scripted input to run is every 5 minutes.
https://avinetworks.com/docs/latest/metrics-list/
Setting up the Avi Networks Splunk App
Recommended Avi versions are 17.2.8 and up.  Any version of Avi 17.2 will work, just know that for the performance metrics specifically there will be a few empty graphs for prior versions.  Controller performance metrics were added in 17.2.5 and the per Service Engine Virtual Service metrics will work 17.2.8 and after.
The only other configuration required within the Avi Networks Splunk add-on itself is for adding entries in the Avi Metrics scripted input to retrieve performance metrics if desired.
The Avi Networks Splunk Add-on should be installed on the search heads, indexers and if they exist; heavy forwarders.  
The Avi Metrics scripted input should be configured to run on a heavy forwarder if one exists, otherwise on a search head.
Analytics
Avi provides end-to-end timing to troubleshoot issues in minutes, end guesswork and reduce time to resolution. Avi assigns health scores for each service based on network monitoring, application performance metrics, logs and security events. Avi Analytics drive actionable insights that make auto scaling seamless, automation intelligent and decision making easy.
Automation
100% API based architecture allows self-service provisioning and integration into the CI/CD pipeline for application delivery. Avi is intent-based by automating the heavy liftings and simplifying end user experience. Avi provides a variety of automation options including Python/GO SDK, RESTful APIs, turn-key integrations with Ansible, Terraform, Grafana, Splunk and Slack.",Version 1.0.26,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/c6ece80c-537a-11ec-8e19-7aeef9beb3b0.png,"IT Operations, DevOps",https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/,815,0,splunk,3,1,matt Karnowski,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/mkarnowski,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

The Technology Add-on for Digital Shadows is used to fetch data from SearchLight portal from Digital Shadow and indexes it in Splunk for further analysis.
Author – Digital Shadows
Version - 1.0.0
Creates Index - False
Compatible with:
Splunk Enterprise version: 6.6.x, 7.0.x, 7.1.x
OS: Platform independent
APPLICATION SETUP
1) Standalone Mode: Install Add-on app on a single machine. This single machine would serve as a Search Head + Indexer + Heavy forwarder for this setup
2) Distributed Environment: Install Add-on on search head and Add-on on Heavy forwarder.
    * Add-on needs to be installed and configure on Heavy Forwarder for data collection.
    * Execute below command to forward data from heavy forwarder to indexer.
    * $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk add forward-server <indexer_ip_address>:9997
    * On Indexer machine, enable event listening on port 9997 (recommended by Splunk).
    * Execute below command to forward data from heavy forwarder to indexer.
    * Add-on needs to be installed on the search head machine and accounts need to be configured. Reason to have Add-on on Search Head is mentioned below.
    * Search time extraction
    * CIM mapping
    * Adaptive response action
    * Macro definition will be needed
3) When configuring the input, do not enable ""Global Incidents"" until after fully executing the first data pull for private incidents. Once that is complete you can enable Global Incidents in the input config, save and exit. Global Incident will then be processed.
** Note: By default, all data is indexed to the main index. If you want to use a custom index then kindly update ""get_digitalshadows_index"" macro in Technology Add-on for Digital Shadows.
The account needs to be configured with an account which has admin access on Splunk.
TROUBLESHOOTING
A good test to see that you are receiving all of the data we expect is to run below searches after several minutes:
    * Execute below search in case TA-digital-shadows Add-on has been installed and configured.
get_digitalshadows_index | stats count by sourcetype
In particular, you should see below sourcetypes:
    * ds:searchlight:credentials
    * ds:searchlight:alerts
    * ds:searchlight:intel_incidents
    * ds:searchlight:intel_ioc_incidents
    * ds:searchlight:riskpipeline
    * If a user doesn’t see data, try expanding time range.
    * Environment variable SPLUNK_HOME must be set
    * Authentication Failure:
Check the network connectivity and make sure that the Digital Shadows server is reachable by executing “ping <server>” command on terminal or command prompt.
    * Adaptive Response Action Failure:
    * User can view update_digital_shadows_incident_status_modalert.log” file located at $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk or can execute “index=cim_modactions sourcetype=modular_alerts:update_digital_shadows_incident_status” query to get more details of the failure.
    * User needs to run Action with admin account.
    * To troubleshoot Digital Shadows SearchLight mod-input check $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/ta_digital_shadows_digital_shadows_searchlight.log file.

This app integrates OTX indicators collected by TA-otx into the Splunk Enterprise Security threat intelligence framework.
It does this with a series of saved searches running (by default) every 12 hours. Previous versions of this app used a modular input to do this: this input is no longer required and should be disabled if you still have it in your system.
Requirements

TA-otx -- This needs to be collecting OTX data, but there is not a requirement for this add-on on the Splunk ES search head
Splunk for Enterprise Security

Setup
To set up this app after install:
1. Ensure that you have OTX data collected by TA-otx and it is fully backfilled to where you want it
1. Customise the macro otx_index to point to where your OTX data is
1. (Optional) Customise the otx_lookback macro if you wish more/less than 90 days of indicators included
1. (Optional) Customise the schedule of all saved searches if you wish more frequent updates
Field mapping
Currently evaluated indicator types from OTX are:

domain
hostname
email
FileHash-*
URL
IPv4
IPv6
CIDR

These map to the equivalent threat intel groups and fields in Splunk ES.
Other field mappings that are important:

A concatenation of OTX tags, targeted industries and targeted countries map to threat_category
OTX adversary maps to threat_group
The description in the Splunk threat_group_intel collection is composed of both the pulse name and description from OTX
The source_path is the URL to view the pulse in detail in OTX

Expiration
There are a set of disabled saved searches called OTX <intel collection> - Retention included. When enabled, these will run overnight and remove any indicator older than 365 days. The exact length of retention can be tuned by modifying the otx_threat_expiry macro.",Version 2.0.1,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/35d68912-76ef-11eb-92a7-06add55d78f8.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance",http://www.apache.org/licenses/,610,0,splunk,0,0,Luke Monahan,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/Rivium,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

Usage
cipher command syntax: 
cipher mode=<d|e> algorithm=<rc4|rot13|rot47|xor> key=<key> \<field-list>
mode: Mandatory. Set to e to cipher, set to d to decipher the given field list using the provided key.
algorithm: Mandatory. Set to the cryptographic algorithm you would like to use for ciphering/deciphering.
key: Mandatory. Specify the key to use. Requirements vary depending on the chosen algorithm.
Cipher results will be output as hex strings (except ROT results where output is ascii). Deciphering (except ROT operations) expects input fields to be hex strings, results will be output in ascii. If the cipher operation fails on a single field or event, this field/event will be skipped and returned as is.
crypt command syntax: 
crypt mode=<d|e> algorithm=<rsa|aes-cbc|aes-ofb> key=<key_name> \<field-list>
mode: Mandatory. Set to e to encrypt, set to d to decrypt the given field list using the provided key.
algorithm: Mandatory. Set to the cryptographic algorithm you would like to use for encryption/decryption.
key: Mandatory. Set to the name of a key you (or your admin) configured previously.
Encryption results will be output base64 encoded. Decryption expects input fields to be base64 encoded, results will be output in ascii. For security purposes the whole search will fail if the crypto operation fails on a single field or event. See Requirements & Configuration for key setup.
encode command syntax: 
encode mode=<to|from> encoding=<base32|base58|base62|base64|base85|binary|decimal|hex|octal> \<field-list>
mode: Mandatory. Set to to for transforming to the specified encoding, set to from to transform from the specified encoding.
encoding: Mandatory. Set to the encoding method to apply to the given field list.
If the encoding operation fails on a single field or event, this field/event will be skipped and returned as is.
hash command syntax: 
hash algorithm=<md5|sha1|sha224|sha256|sha384|sha512|sha3_224|sha3_256|sha3_384|sha3_512|blake2b|blake2s> [salt=\<salt_name>] \<field-list>
algorithm: Mandatory. Set to the hashing algorithm you would like to use. SHA3 and Blake2 are only available when using Python 3.
saltfile: Optional. Set to the name of a key you (or your admin) configured previously.
For security purposes the whole search will fail if the hash operation fails on a single field or event. See Requirements & Configuration for salt setup.
Examples
XOR the field ""message"" with byte ""\x2f"".
   search sourcetype=""ctf"" | cipher algorithm=xor key=""2f"" message | table _time alice, bob, message
Decode the hex contents of ""payload"" and display readable ascii values in a table.
   search sourcetype=""snort"" | encode mode=from encoding=hex payload | table _time src_ip, dest_ip, payload
Encrypt the values of the plaintext fields ""subject"" and ""content"" of sourcetype ""mail"" using rsa and the key ""public.pem"".
   search sourcetype=""mail"" | crypt mode=e algorithm=rsa key=public.pem subject content
Encrypt raw events of sourcetype ""mail"" using AES-256-CBC and collect the results in a summary index.
   search sourcetype=""mail"" | crypt mode=e algorithm=aes-cbc key=secret.txt _raw | collect index=summary
Decrypt the content of the already RSA encrypted and summary-indexed field ""username"" for output in plain text using RSA. The key file ""private.pem"" is encrypted with AES-256-CBC, so the correspondig password has to be set via the app's set up screen prior to using the key.
   search index=summary sourcetype=""server::access"" | crypt mode=d algorithm=rsa key=private.pem username | table _time action username
Hash a raw event containing some malware threat artifact using sha256.
   search index=threat_intel source=sample.txt | hash algorithm=sha256 _raw
Installation

Just unpack to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps on your Splunk search head and restart the instance. Use the deployer in a distributed environment. Make sure, the app's folder name in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps is TA-cryptosuite (Downloading apps from Github and uploading them to Splunk might result in different folder names).
Assign the roles 'can_encrypt' and/or 'can_decrypt' to users/roles who should be able to encrypt/decrypt data using the crypt command. The cipher, hash and encode commands will automatically be available to all users.
Read and follow the requirements & configuration section below.
Optional: Set python.version=python2 or python.version=python3 in commands.conf, inputs.conf and restmap.conf if you would like to explicitly specify the Python version to use. Otherwise this will be determined by your instance's global settings.
Optional: Change the app's visibility via Manage>Apps or app.conf if you wish. Configuring new keys/salts relies on an internal dashboard though.

Requirements & Configuration
In order for the crypt command of this add-on to be fully usable you'll need to create and upload cryptographic keys. Here's how. You can also find some examples and tips in the examples/ directory.
1.1. If you plan on using RSA, generate a valid RSA key pair (optionally with key encryption) and store it in PEM format.
     Example RSA key pair creation with currently supported parameters using OpenSSL:
         openssl genrsa [-aes256|-des|-des3 -passout pass:password] -out private.pem \<2048|4096>
         openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -RSAPublicKey_out -out public.pem
         Note that using 1024 bit keys is considered unsafe and therefore not supported by the app.
         Important Note: Use of encrypted private RSA keys is only supported when having the ""pycryptodomex"" Python package installed (see below)!
1.2. If you plan on using AES, create a ""key file"".
     Example ""key file"" creation for AES:
         Put your key and IV in UTF-8 into a plain ASCII file. Key has to go on line 1 and IV on line 2.
         The IV's length has to be 16 bytes/characters. The key's length has to be 16/24/32 bytes/characters respectively for 128/192/256 AES encryption. For security purposes 256 bit keys are recommended unless performance is important.

Go to the app's configuration dashboard in your preferred browser. Click ""Create New Input"".

     Name: Enter the name you would like the your key to be accessible through. E.g. the original key file's name.
     Type of Data: Select ""New key"".
     Key/Salt: Copy-paste the contents of your generated key file here. Your key will be stored encrypted in passwords.conf.
     RSA key encryption password: Only required if you are currently configuring an encrypted private RSA key. Supported key encryption algorithms are AES-256-CBC, DES-CBC and DES-EDE3-CBC. Important Note: Use of encrypted private RSA keys is only supported when having the ""pycryptodomex"" Python package installed (see below)!
     Authorized roles: Select which roles you want to grant permissions to use the key. Will be ORed with authorized users. Users/roles will also require the ""can_encrypt"" and/or ""can_decrypt"" role in order to use the crypt command in the first place.
     Authorized users: Select which users you want to grant permissions to use the key. Will be ORed with authorized roles. Users/roles will also require the ""can_encrypt"" and/or ""can_decrypt"" role in order to use the crypt command in the first place.
     Note: For a RSA key pair, you'll have to do this twice. Once for the private key and once for the public key.
If you plan on salting your hashes when using the hash command, create and store upload salts like so:

Go to the app's configuration dashboard in your preferred browser. Click ""Create New Input"".

     Name: Enter the name you would like the your salt to be accessible through.
     Type of Data: Select ""New salt"".
     Key/Salt: Enter or copy-paste your salt here. It will be stored encrypted in passwords.conf.
     RSA key encryption password: Leave empty.
     Authorized roles: Select which roles you want to grant permissions to use the salt. Will be ORed with authorized users.
     Authorized users: Select which users you want to grant permissions to use the salt. Will be ORed with authorized roles.
Note: Handling keys and salts this way is a security feature, since specifing the key/salt directly in a Splunk search directly would make them visible in the _internal index. Keys are not handled like this for the cipher command, as the implemented ciphers are generally not regarded as secure anymore.
On the use of encrypted private RSA keys and used Python libraries: By default the add-on uses a pure-Python implementation of the RSA (and AES) algorithm which comes shipped with the add-on for all platforms. This implementation does not support usage of encrypted private RSA keys. Their usage is only possible by installing the ""pycryptodomex"" Python package to your OS's installation of an instance of Python 3.7.8 or 2.7.17 (see https://www.pycryptodome.org/en/latest/src/installation.html). After the package's successful installation, configure this add-on to make use of the system Python's installed packages via the add-on's configuration page. Unfortunately due to Splunk's built-in Python's poor handling of 3rd party packages, the package cannot be installed to only that instance of Python.
Notes & Restrictions

Attempts to modify _time will be ignored since Splunk always expects a valid _time field.
Wildcards for field names are not supported (yet).
Encryption and decryption of big quantities of data can be ressource intensive operations. Use with caution in old or feeble environments.
Currently only AES-256-CBC, DES-CBC and DES-EDE3-CBC are supported for private RSA key file encryption.
To implement proper key/salt management (without relying on my weak JavaScript skills for a management dashboard) the add-on leverages the comfort Splunk Add-On Builder grants. \
This is why your key/salt configurations are stored as modular input configurations. Don't worry, they are not used as such. A future version of the add-on might implement this better.

(Important) Security Considerations

Granting a user or role the role 'can_encrypt' or 'can_decrypt' needed for usage of the crypt command will also grant them the capability 'list_storage_passwords'. \
This enables the technically savvy user to potentially read more secrets via Splunk's REST API than desirable. \
Unfortunately as of now there is no way around this if the encryption/decryption keys and salts used for this app's function should not be stored in plaintext on disk. \
You can argue this way or that. My assumption is that only high-privileged users will use the crypto functionality in the first place, and thus prefferred encrypted keys over potentially exessive permissions.

The keys and salts you upload are stored encrypted in passwords.conf. However to quote a Splunk blog post: ""[...] Since the encrypted data and the encryption key are stored on the same machine, cryptographically this is equivalent to obfuscation. While some people might argue that this is very weak encryption, it is the best we can do with storing the encrypted data and encryption key on the same machine and it is definitely better than clear text passwords [...]""[0].


The used libraries (see Attribution) have been chosen due to their compatibility with multiple Python versions and OSes. They might not be the best implementations of the respective algorithms and are certainly not the fastest, but more popular implementations posed compatibility challenges due to relying on platform-specific compiled c modules.

The used RSA implementation is only capable of processing so many bytes of data at once during encryption, fields larger than that value have to be split into blocks. This might enable certain attacks on the RSA crypto system. To mitigate the chances of a successful attack, random padding (PKCS#1 v2 (OAEP)) is used and can not be disabled in this version of the add-on.
Using 1024 bit RSA keys is generally considered unsafe and therefore not possible using with the add-on.

I chose AES-CBC and AES-OFB as the only available modes as they offer the best balance between performance and security for the purposes of this add-on.


It is not recommended to use MD5 or SHA1 for security purposes (e.g. storing password hashes) since these hashing algorithms are not regarded as safe anymore.

It is not recommended to use the ciphers provided through the cipher command for security purposes (e.g. storing safely encrypted data) since these algorithms are not regarded as safe anymore.
SHA3 and Blake2 are only available when using Python3 as your environment's interpreter.

The agileSI Splunk app correlates, analyzes and visualizes security relevant data and events from SAP systems by the help of Splunk searches, dashboards and reports.
The SAP/Splunk integration requires the agileSI connector software, agileSI or agileSI light, to get the events into Splunk.
A free demo version of agileSI light is available via the download section on our agileSI website (http://www.agilesi.net/en/resources/)
Requirements
•    ""agileSI"" or ""agileSI light"" SAP Connector/Agent software (to get the events into Splunk)
Installation
•   Download and install the agileSI App for Splunk
•   Create and configure index(es) for your agileSI/SAP data on Splunk (optional)
•   configure inputs.conf and set the correct sourectypes (see: Forwarding your log files)
Forwarding your log files
•   Install Splunk Universal Forwarder on your system where agileSI connector (agileSI or agileSI Light) is installed
    or use the syslog function of the agileSI light connector
•   inputs.conf of your forwarder must contain the following information:
    •   Directory on the filesystem to be monitored 
    •   The correct index, you configured on the indexer
    •   Set the correct sourcetype
            For the agileSI light connector, the correct sourcetype is ""agileSI""
Configuration of your Splunk system
•   The role of the agileSI user needs authorizations to the configured indexes
•   The configured index needs to be added to ""Indexes searched by default"" in the role of the agileSI user
Saved searches
This app includes some saved searches. 
Some of the saved searches will populate dashboard, to accelerate the dashboard.
After installing the app, it takes some time until all saved searches are run once. 
Because of this, you will get some error messages like ""Error in 'SearchOperator:loadjob': Cannot find artifacts for savedsearch..."".
If all saved searches were executed once, thie error messages should be disapeared.
The search ""agileSI - Security incidents"" will populate the summary index ""summary_agilesi"".
This summary index is needed for some dashboard searces. (Of course, you can customize this summary index. See: ""Customizing of agileSI"") 
Customizing of agileSI
agileSI  comes with a lot of searches that correlate SAP data with lookup tables.
Most of them are preconfigured but the following should be maintained by the customer:
All lists are located in “$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/agileSI/lookups” and have the suffix “.csv”
•   agileSI-Users_in_Corporate_Directory (White list for user)
•   agileSI-Known_locations (SAP-Systems of your landscape)
•   agileSI-List_of_user_accounts_to_be_watched (Priviledged user per system-id to be watched)
•   agileSI-List_of_firefighter_accounts (List of your firefighter/emergency user per system-id)
•   agileSI-List_of_administrator_accounts (List of your basis administrators per system-id)
The summary index ""summary_agilesi"" has the following defaults:
•   Data will be frozen (deleted) after 186 days (~6 month)
•   Maximum size of this index is 5GB.
For customizing ""summary_agilesi"", it is recommended to create a directory named ""local"" inside the app directory.
Configure the custom paramater in “$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/agileSI/local/indexes.conf"".

Who is this app for?
This app is for anyone who wants to visualise and correlate multiple separate events on a common timeline.
How does the app work?
This app provides a visualization that you can use in your own apps and dashboards.
To use it in your dashboards, simply install the app, and create a search that provides the values you want to display.
Usecases for the Event Timeline Visualization:

Displaying time-based events
Comparing the duration and severity of incident tickets created over the past month
Tracking production releases and version information over time
Visualizing server metrics over hours or days
Tracking Notable Events over time

How to use the visualization
The following fields can be used in the search:
-   label (required): A title for the event being displayed.
-   start (required): A date and time indicating the start of the event
-   end (optional): A data and time indicating the end of the event
-   group (optional): A group name to categorise the events and display them together
-   color (optional): This is usually generated by the rangemap command. It is used to set the color for the slide. Valid colors are: red, amber, green. If using rangemap, use 'range' instead of 'color'. Valid values include: low, elevated, severe, ok, warning, etc
-   data (optional): A value to use for drilldowns, which is not displayed to the user, e.g. ID numbers, references, sources. The data field will be used to populate the $tok_et_data$ token.
Example Search
| makeresults count=25 
| eval start=_time-random()% 7*24*60*60

Installing
Where to install this add-on
Unless otherwise noted, all supported add-ons can be safely installed to all tiers of a distributed Splunk platform deployment. See Where to install Splunk add-ons in Splunk Add-ons for more information.
This table provides a reference for installing this specific add-on to a distributed deployment of Splunk Enterprise.



Splunk platform component
Supported
Required
Comments




Search Heads
Yes
Yes
This add-on contains search-time knowledge. It is recommended to turn visibility off on your search heads to prevent data duplication errors that can result from running inputs on your search heads instead of (or in addition to) on your data collection node.


Heavy Forwarders
Yes
No (but recommended)
It is recommended to install this add-on on a heavy forwarder for data collection.  Data collection should be configured in only 1 place to avoid duplicates.


Indexers
Yes
No
Not required as the parsing operations occur on the forwarders.


Universal Forwarders
No
No
Universal forwarders are not supported for data collection because the modular inputs require Python and the Splunk REST handler.



FAQ
SSL certificate issue
If you encounter a SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED issue, the SSL certificate entry might be missing from your certificate store. Resolve the issue by adding the certificate to your add-on's trust list.
The add-on uses the Python requests library to make REST calls to Microsoft.  Requests will throw this SSL error if it's unable to verify the certificate.
Reference => https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#ssl-cert-verification

Navigate to /opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-MS_Defender/bin/ta_ms_defender/aob_py3/certifi
Edit cacert.pem
Paste the contents of your root certificate in the file
Restart Splunk

Working with multivalue fields
The Microsoft 365 Defender data is returned as JSON.  The JSON data will have multivalued fields that you may want to break up into individual events at search time.
For example, if we want to turn each evidence object in an incident into an individual event to identify parent/child process, the following search can be used:
sourcetype=""ms:defender:atp:alerts"" id=""SOME ALERT ID"" | spath path=evidence{} output=evidence | mvexpand evidence | eval _raw=evidence | extract | search processId!=null | rename id AS alertId | table alertId, processId, processCreationTime, processCommandLine, parentProcessId, parentProcessCreationTime, parentProcessFileName
Explanation
The search uses the spath command to target the evidence array in the JSON data.  Then, it uses the mvexpand command to turn each evidence record in the array into an individual event in the search.  Next, we use a combination of manipulating the _raw field and extracting the values using the extract command.  Finally, we print the results as a table.  This shows us the alert ID, process details, and parent details.

Requirements

Splunk Enterprise 7.0 or later.
This app is designed to ingest SAP Solman data into Splunk metrics index (added in Splunk 7.0).
Splunk ITSI 4.0.1.
System Landscape Requirements for SAP Solution Manager were described on Monitor Systems - SAP Help Portal.

SAP and Splunk Prerequisites
Before deploying the app, you must ensure the following:


You have activated the required OData Service AI_SYSMON_OVERVIEW_SRV and SAPUI5 application service SM_TM_SYSMON according to App Implementation: Monitor Systems - SAP Help Portal.


Authorization settings are required to be set in SAP Solution Manager and to fetch data using relevant OData service. Authorizations were described in Security Guide for SAP Fiori Apps – SAP Solution Manager 7.2 SPS8 System Monitoring - SAP Help Portal.


Configuration System monitoring SAP landscape and custom metrics were described on System Monitoring 7.2 - Setup and Configuration - SCN Wiki.


Add-on requires Splunk kvstore to be operational on the instance that it is deployed on. Make sure that it is not disabled.


Add-on is designed to store obtained data within metrics index. Create a metrics index on your indexer(s) (for example called solman_metrics).


In distributed deployment option (see option 2 below), on ITSI environment, create a user that has the capabilities to create ITSI service via REST interface.


Installation
There are two options for add-on deployment: standalone ITSI server and distributed option.
Versions 1.0.0 and 1.1.0 support only the first option.
Versions 1.2.0 and above support both.
In standalone ITSI option, the add-on is installed on the same Splunk instance that also has ITSI REST interface.
Here the ITSI Splunk instance must have direct network connectivity to SAP OData interface (be within organization's security perimeter).
The first option does not work well for ITSI in Splunk Cloud or other distributed environment when ITSI instance can not or should not access SAP instances directly.
In that case, install the add-on on Splunk Heavy Forwarder that is close to SAP instances.
It will forward all collected data to the Splunk indexers and create corresponding ITSI services using ITSI REST interface.
Install the technology add-on on either ITSI instance (option 1) or on Splunk Heavy Forwarder (option 2):


Log in to Splunk and go to Apps > Manage Apps.


Click install app from file.


Upload the app package file and click upload.


Upgrading
Upgrading from v1.2.0 to v1.3.0
Version 1.3.0 introduced initial setup page. In order to let the v1.3.0 app understand that the application has been previously configured, edit $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/sap_solman_app/local/app.conf adding the following stanza:
[install]
is_configured = 1
Starting with v1.3.0, the modular input instance has to be named as ""main_input"". Edit $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/sap_solman_app/local/inputs.conf so that the stanza is called:
[sap_solman_mi://main_input]
...
After these configuration preparations, proceed with application upgrade. This can be done using UI.
Once the upgrade is done, please wait for several hours to let the application learn the actual metric update intervals. This should help eliminating gray N/A values that could be present in pre-1.3 versions of the app for the metrics that are rarely updated. The more you wait, the more precise the update intervals become.
In order to apply the new threshold level logic, after upgrade, navigate to Solman Configuration Dashboard and perform the following:

Click Disable all button and hit Save
Enable back the relevant metrics and hit Save

This will enforce new threshold rules and update period intervals.
Configuration


After installing the application, perform the initial setup

Go to the Manage Apps page and click Set up




Enter the Solman URL, user, and password. In case of standalone deployment option, do not enter ITSI REST-related fields. In case of distributed deployment, enter ITSI REST URL, user, and password. The recommended update interval is 300 seconds (5 minutes), this may be set to a higher value to reduce the load on Solman server. Choose the metrics index that has to be used for data ingestion.



Check use new server version if you want to use new Odata client(Right now, this version is experimental).




Configure the metrics to be collected. On the first invocation, modular input populates solman_metrics key-value store collection discovering all the systems and metrics available on SAP Solman. On the host having the add-on deployed, go to Solman Configuration Dashboard. Click on the button corresponding to the SAP system to be configured. Click on the sliders to enable or disable metrics collection. Once done, click on green Save button. Please wait for the Solman data to refresh before it gets into Splunk index (may take several minutes).



Navigate to ITSI Service Analyzer dashboard. You will see the data from the configured system



Troubleshooting
Use the troubleshooting dashboard within the app.

By default, app logging level is set to WARN.
To increase logging verbosity, edit $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/sap_solman_app/local/log.conf adding the following stanzas:
[default]
log_level = DEBUG

[splunklib.modularinput.script]
log_level = DEBUG

[sap_solman_mi]
log_level = DEBUG
If still in trouble, ask a question on Splunk Answers and email Operational_Intelligence_Support@epam.com.

Parse every HL7 message from log entry.*
Extract every segment within any HL7 v2.x message into it's own Splunk Field.**
Extract every field within every segment in the message.**
Provide examples on how to extract values from HL7 subfields.
        i.e. PID-5 contains family_name,given_name,middle_name,suffix,prefix,degree.
        Individual fields are created for each of these.
Provide examples on how to enrich HL7 coded values with actual contextual descriptions.
        i.e. MSH-9 may have ADT^A08.
        A new field Message_Type will also be present with a value of ""Update Patient Information""

If the logs come from Cloverleaf's Interface engine there are additional extractions for thread_id, client ip, and client port.
Notes:
   *The datetime format can vary for each HL7 message.  In lieu of using TIME_FORMAT inside props.conf
   a custom datetime.xml was created inside this app.  The extracted groups correspond to those specified
   in the extracted attribute for define element.  The groups (year, month, day, etc.) are specified in
   Splunk's default datetime.xml in /etc/system/datetime.xml.
**Repeating Segments will be placed inside multi-value fields.
   i.e. If there are four NTE segments in the message there will be one multi-value NTE field with four values.
   The subsequent HL7 fields will only be extracted for the first segment in repeating segments.
Sample Files
The reference files used for this Add-on can be found in the cloverleaf_logs directory.
The samples directory contains files used to generate sample messages.  If you install Splunk's Eventgen App v7.2+ [https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1924/#/overview] these samples will be replayed and put in your main index. 
You'll also need to modify splunkUser and splunkPass in eventgen.conf to match credentials on your system.
Handling Extraction of Repeating Segments
HL7_Segment_Template transformation uses MV_ADD = true to aggregate repeating segments.  However, you ultimately need to construct a mv field using the makemv SPL command to split them out for use.  However, I was unable to split it using the newline character as a delimiter, needed to add an anchor to the end of each line first.
So, take this sample message with repeating DG1 segments:

HL7_Segment_Template transform, with MV_ADD = true, collected ALL the DG1 segments and put the aggregated values as the single value for DG1:
1||52^Headache^HRV|Headache||
2||53^Neck^NCK|Neck||
3||54^Ear^EAR|Outer Ear||
Then I ran this SPL:   sourcetype=""hl7_v2"" DG1=*| rex mode=sed field=DG1 ""s/$/:/g""
which tacks on a "":"" delimiter to end of the line and produces:
1||52^Headache^HRV|Headache||:
2||53^Neck^NCK|Neck||:
3||54^Ear^EAR|Outer Ear||:
This SPL then combines the three segments into single line, using end of line as anchor: 
sourcetype=""hl7_v2"" DG1=* | rex mode=sed field=DG1 ""s/$/:/g"" | makemv delim=""$"" DG1
1||52^Headache^HRV|Headache||:2||53^Neck^NCK|Neck||:3||54^Ear^EAR|Outer Ear||:
Then I employ the split function multiple times within an eval to split DG1, and use mvindex to extract the particular iterated DG1 segment:
sourcetype=""hl7_v2"" DG1=* | rex mode=sed field=DG1 ""s/$/:/g"" | makemv delim=""$"" DG1| eval s1=mvindex(split('DG1', "":""),0), s2=mvindex(split('DG1', "":""),1), s3=mvindex(split('DG1', "":""),2)

The FRED® Add-On for Splunk provides a way to easily retrieve FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Database) data and send into Splunk.
""This product uses the FRED® API but is not endorsed or certified by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.""
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/terms_of_use.html
Getting an API key from FRED
To use the FRED Add-On for Splunk you will need to register with FRED and receive an API key. This process is free and simple, just go to the following URL: https://research.stlouisfed.org/useraccount/login/secure/
Keep your API key handy you will need it later.
Installing the FRED Add-On for Splunk

Download the app install file from SplunkBase or Github releases and save it in an easily accessible place.
The add-on consists of a modular input and a KVStore list used by the input. 
The add-on would be installed on a search head where the FRED_Default_List will be populated
The add-on may also be installed on a heavy forwarder to configure the input portion and offload processing from the search head

Configuring the FRED Add-On for Splunk
The initial installation of the add-on is pretty straight forward. It consists of a few simple steps.

Create an index for your data
Strongly recommended name 'fred_data'. This name will allow for a no configuration installation of the Economic Analysis for Splunk app.
Populating the FRED_Default_List KVStore lookup list.

The FRED Default List provides two main functions

It tells the add-on what FRED data series to retrieve

It provides lookup data in the Economic Analysis for Splunk app.
Typically most people will want to start by seeding the FRED Default List with the base data. To do this complete the following:
- Click on Configuration-->Initial Setup in the add-on drop down menu.
- Click the LoadList button
- Click OK to confirm the warning and the complete message





Setting up credentials for the KVStore Server

This is simply Splunk login credentials the add-on uses to authenticate to the KVStore Server, which could be the local server or possibly the search head if you are running the input function on a heavy forwarder.
Click Configuration-->Account
Click the add button

Complete account name, user, and password and save.



Entering the FRED API key

This step is to enter the API key obtained from FRED
Click Configuration-->Add-On Settings
Enter FRED API Key

Click the Save button



Setting up the input definition

The FRED Add-On for Splunk supports two types of inputs one input which can be used to setup a single series. This input will rarely be used as second input type uses a list and the input will just retrieve data for all series maintained in the list so no need for separate inputs. To setup the FRED Default List Input complete the following:
Click Inputs
Click Create New Input --> FRED Series List
Complete input form options
Click Save




Splunk Custom Command - fred
The FRED Add-On for Splunk also includes a custom command that will get data from the FRED API in real-time. Below is an example of getting 10-Year Treasury Rates
| fred series_id=DGS10 start_date=2015-01-01 end_date=2020-11-01
The fred command uses the FRED api key configured in the add-on setup
Using the FRED Add-On for Splunk
The easiest way to get started with the FRED Add-On for Splunk is to install the Economic Analysis for Splunk app, which comes with a base set of dashboards and searches to get you started with the FRED data in Splunk.

About PAVO Web Proxies App for Splunk
Overview
In many organizations, web proxies separate users from the Web at large. User web activity can often be a good indicator of possible compromise, phishing attempts, abuse, and outdated software. This app provides Splunk dashboards, forms, and reports which can be used to explore your web proxy events, and make sense of what can often be a large volume of data.
To do this, the app relies on the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) for Web events. This means that the app can report on any web proxy data, as long as it has been on-boarded properly, and is available through the Web data model.
A note on Splunk Data Model Acceleration and Disk Space
This app requires data model acceleration, which will use additional disk space. If you are using the Splunk App for Enterprise Security, this is already enabled, and should have been factored into your retention policies. If not, you should review the documentation on data model acceleration, how it uses disk space, and how to plan for it.
A note on the Splunk Common Information Model
As mentioned above, the app uses the CIM for proxy events. The CIM allows you to take events from a number of sources or products, and report on them in one cohesive manner, using a common set of names for fields and event types.
Available Dashboards
Web Proxy Overview
This dashboard serves as a jumping-off point for exploring your web proxy data. It includes panels for traffic over time, categories, top talkers, and users. Clicking on panels in this dashboard will drill down to the appropriate profile page for further exploration.
User Profile
This form provides panels based on a users activity, including source IP addresses, category history, and destinations. By focusing on a particular user, you can see browsing activity, generate a report for HR, or see where a user may have become infected.
Source Profile
This form provides panels based on source IP addresses, often the users computer or servers. This includes activity over time, categories, users, user agents, and destinations. Use this form when you need to see what sites a particular IP has been visiting, which is useful if you find an un-authenticated session which is attempting to visit different sites.
Category Profile
This form provides panels based on a category. This includes requests over time, destinations, users, and sources. If particular categories are of concern for your organization, you can use this form to find users or systems which have visited the category.
Destination Profile
This form provides panels based on destination, which may be a hostname or IP address. This includes URLs, categories, users, and sources. Using this form allows you to see what users visited a particular site, and which URLs are popular with your users. On sites which are categorized based on different URLs, you can see all of the categories for visits to the destination.If you know of a compromised site (such as a watering hole attack), you can use this form to quickly find users and systems which may have visited it.
Policy Exceptions
This dashboard shows users going to bad categories, showing the categories and user activity. Note that the selection of bad categories, which often changes from organization to organization, can be customized by following the steps in the section titled Customizing Categories for Policy Exceptions. Using this dashboard can highlight users which may be violating your organizations usage agreement or systems which may be compromised.
User Agents
This dashboard provides analysis of the user-agent strings present in the web proxy events. To do this, the dashboard searches use a lookup which parses the user-agent strings. There are other lookups which perform this function, but TA-user-agents is used by default. For information on customizing the lookup being used, see the section titled Customizing user-agent lookups. Using this dashboard will help you find outdated or unauthorized browsers/software in your environment. Additionally, because some malware either modifies user-agent strings, or have their own, you may find compromised systems on your network.
Proxy Event Search
This form provides an easy way to search proxy events for particular activity.If you already know what you are looking for, this form makes it easy to generate a search that return the events you need. Dont forget that you can use the search icon at the bottom of the events panel to open the search in the Splunk search interface.
Sourcetypes
This dashboard provides panels to compare and contrast the activity of sourcetypes. Use the time-picker to display sourcetype activity over time and to visualize event counts by sourcetype.

Prerequisites
This app depends on data models included in the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on, specifically the Web data model. Please review the information on installing and using the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on and information on configuring the acceleration on the data model.
The Splunk Common Information Model Add-on can be downloaded from Splunkbase.
This app has been tested with versions 4.X of the CIM add-on.
In order to make the app respond and load quickly, accelerated data models are used to provide summary data. For this data to be available, the Web data model must be accelerated. Information on how to enable acceleration for the Web data model can be found here. The data model must be accelerated for the length of time for which you would like to see reporting.
The Breakdown of Sourcetypes in Indexes in Dataset panel on the Data Transparency Overview dashboard will only be seen if the Sankey Diagram visualization is installed.
The Sankey Diagram Visualization can be downloaded from Sankey Diagram Custom Visualization.
User-agent strings are very difficult to parse efficiently using regular expressions. To make this easier and faster, an external lookup is used. By default, the TA-user-agents is used, as it requires no additional data download or internet access. TA-user-agents can be downloaded from here: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1843/
The user-agent lookup being used can be customized. See the section titled Customizing user-agent lookups for more information.
Not all organizations are the same, so there is a good chance that the default bad categories will need to be customized to meet the needs and policies of your organization. Additionally, customizations may be required based on the type of web proxy device generating the events.
Different web proxy vendors is different category names, so one list wouldnt cover all vendors. To enable support for different vendors, a macro named apl_web_wfa_lookup is used.
Currently this app comes pre-configured with lookups for 7 different products:


Barracuda: apl_web_barracuda_wfa


Bluecoat (default): apl_web_bluecoat_wfa


Cisco WSA: apl_web_cisco_wsa_wfa


McAfee Web Gateway: apl_web_mcafee_wg_wfa


Palo Alto Firewalls: apl_web_palo_alto_wfa


URLBlacklist: apl_web_urlblacklist_wfa


Websense: apl_web_websense_wfa


These lookup files can be found in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/aplura_web_proxies_app/lookups.
To configure the app to use the correct lookup for your data, edit the apl_web_wfa_lookup macro to match the vendor from the list above. More information on editing Splunk macros can be found in the Splunk documentation.
Note: While Splunk has configuration layering for configuration files, it does not have the same layering for lookup files. This means that if you customize one of these lookup files instead of creating your own, you need to make sure to back it up before upgrading this app, as it may be overwritten.
Because your organizations policies may differ from what is represented in the provided lookups, or you may be using a product which is not listed above, you may wish to use your own custom lookup for Policy Exceptions. A custom lookup for Policy Exceptions should have two columns, category and wfa. The category column should match the name of the category produced by your proxy device to which visits from clients are not allowed, or need to be reviewed. The second column, wfa, should always have a value of TRUE. You can always look at the existing lookups for an example.
Once you have created your lookup, edit the apl_web_wfa_lookup macro with the name of the lookup you have created.
The use of wildcards for the lookup file is not configured out of the box, however, it can by copying the transforms.conf file from the /default directory to the /local directory and adjusting the configuration of the apl_web_wfa_lookup macro in macros.conf.
By default, this app uses an external lookup to provide analytics on user-agent string. The default lookup used is the TA-user-agents lookup, however, this can be customized to use another lookup which may be more accurate or provide more fields for customizing the dashboard.
To customize the lookup, download and installed the other lookup. Copy the macros.conf file from the aplura_web_proxies_app/default directory of the app to a aplura_web_proxies_app/local directory (which you may need to create). Edit the macros.conf file, and edit the apl_web_user_agent_lookup macro to be the name of the custom lookup, and then edit the apl_web_ua_family_field to match the high-level product name (for example IE or Firefox). The use of the macros expect that the field being used for the lookup will be the CIM-compliant http_user_agent. If the lookup is expecting something else, then the dashboard will need to be customized to match.

Welcome to the Cb Defense App for Splunk.
The Cb Defense App for Splunk integrates Cb Defense with Splunk Enterprise! Please ensure that the Cb Defense Add-on for Splunk is installed before installing this app, as this app requires the Add-on to function. 
The V1.0.0 Release includes pre-built visualizations from Cb.
Providing a thorough overview of Cb Defense environments as well as dashboards to  search through threat and policy notifications, view and manipulate device status, etc.
Main Features

Cb Defense Overview Dashboard
Comprehensive Overview of your Cb Defense data in Splunk
view total detections, policy actions, rare applications
triage threats by severity
Threat Search
geoip map of threats based on severity
additional table of threat information
searchable (SPL) to isolate threat events of interest
Policy Action Search
geoip map of Policy Actions by reputation
tabular display of policy activities
searchable (SPL) to isolate policy events of interest
Login Map (Splunk)
geoip map and table of Logins (attempted and successful)  to Splunk instances
Device Search
powered by the devicesearch custom search command
uses the Cb Defense REST API to retrieve device status information
geoip map of devices by external IPs + table of the same
enter a device query to filter results like ‘hostname:WIN-1984VBRULES’ or ‘ipAddress:172.17.178.1’

Adaptive Response framework and Splunk Enterprise Security integration.
Currently supported adaptive response actions:
- Change Cb Defense Sensor Policy: Change the assigned security policy of one or more Cb Defense devices based on :  IP address, hostname or deviceId in an event
- Fully integrated with existing alert & notable event framework in Splunk Enterprise Security. 
-  Host Name Matching as per 
    - use 'hostnameexact' inptutype for exact matching and 'hostname' for in-exact 
Requirements:
(hard) - Cb Defense Add-on for Splunk
Installation & Setup/Configuration
Download the app from Splunkbase, or build from the source available on github.
(basic)
Use the gear icon from the Splunk left hand navigation bar to 'manage apps' - select Cb Defense and click 'setup'
Enter the (sans protocol, https is implied and enforced) base URL  for your Cb Defense API endpoint. See information on which URL to use here. 
Enter your API Key (Must be type API or Live Response ) in the API Key input field.
Enter your Connector Id (Must be type API or Live Response) in the Connector ID input Field. 
(advanced)
The app comes loaded with a search macro cbdefense in default/macros.conf that defines Carbon Black Defense events. This is used to power most of the visualizations. 
In order to support all use cases, it defaults to :
index=* sourcetype=(carbonblack:defense:json)
If you would like to only search specific indexes, change the macro (UI accessible, or on disk).
For instance, if you would like to use the 'carbonblack' index change the macro to indicate index=""carbonblack"".
Adaptive Response Configuration
The Change Cb Defense Change Sensor Policy Adaptive Response action has 3 important configuration options:
- 'inputtype' either Ip Address, deviceId , hostname, or hostname exact
  - This option specifies the intended indicator in the incoming result set
  - The indicator can be an ‘Ip Address’ (IPV4) , a deviceId (an integer) or a hostname (choose hostnameexact for exact-matching - otherwise hostnames will be matched as per the Cb Defense Rest API)
- 'fieldname' - the field in your result set to target, for instance deviceInfo.deviceId
  - ex , when inputtype = deviceId, fieldname = deviceInfo.deviceId the modular action will try to find a sensor by the deviceId in the 'deviceInfo.deviceId' of the incoming result set
-  Policy Name - the Cb Defense Policy to be applied to the targeted sensors. The policy must exist.  For instance 'default' or 'Restrictive_Windows_Workstation' .
 - note: If you try to change from policy A to policy A for sensor B , it will always succeed.

We can change sensor policy by hostname using inputtype = hostname or hostnameexact, and targetig the 'deviceInfo.deviceName' field. 
To target the deviceId, use deviceInfo.deviceId and inputtype = hostname
In general, Splunk operators are not limited to using only the dataprovided by the Cb Defense Add-on for Splunk - but must configure the Adaptive Response action appropriately. 
Debugging and Logging information
The Add-On log level and debugging configuration is seperate from the App. If you're having problems getting data into Splunk, raise the log level in the Add-On and check the add-on logs. 
The App logs to the $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log directory.

Use the online version here: https://git.io/splhighlighter
.  
The web version has the same functionality as the splunkbase app, so is best for most users. It is also safe (Code is never sent to the server so you can use it with sensitive information - unless you use the built-in URL shortener).

Despite its maturity and long history, DNS protocol was not designed with security in mind and thus has many means of malicious exploitation. Methods to transfer non-DNS data over the protocol are called DNS tunneling and allow to obfuscate and transmit botnet C2 traffic or slowly exfiltrate data. DNS Security Check is a first and easy step towards DNS security in any organization. It detects, provides visual display and automatic alerts on the DNS packets addressed to non-corporate DNS servers, unusually large DNS packet sizes and even potential Fast-Flux DNS botnet traffic. Many threats related to DNS protocol abuse can be mitigated by secure network design, which is reflected in CISO brief for this Use Case.
DNS Security Check Basic and DNS Security Check Advanced are available from SOC Prime.

The primary purpose of this Add-On is to collect time series event data from Okta using the Okta System Log API.  This Add-On also contains the ability to ingest Okta Universal Directory (UD) using Okta's Users, Groups and Apps APIs.
This guide will cover the steps required to ingest Log data from Okta.  
The steps required to ingest UD data are similar but not covered here and I suggest that you NOT configure them unless you have a specific use case for ingesting directory state data.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
This add-on will require the Okta Domain and the API Token for an Administrative Account in that Okta Domain.  We recommend creating a dedicated service account for this purpose and assigning the minimum privileges.  Use the Create and API Token guide for detailed steps.
Install
We can now install the Add-on in our Splunk environment.  This add-on is primarily a tool for collecting logs and is only required to be installed on a heavy forwarder.  It does contain saved searches and other knowledge objects so installation on search heads is helpful.  Only configure an input on one Splunk server.

Install via the Splunk webapp (recommended) or manually copy and expand the app into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ location
Restart the Splunk server

Configure Settings (optional)
Using the Splunk webapp, login and launch the newly installed Okta Identity Cloud Add-on.
The default settings are appropriate in most cases.  Be aware of the advanced Add-on Settings and Logging available in the Configuration menu.
Rate limits and adaptive self-throttling

Navigate to Configuration -> Add-on Settings

There are 3 settings related to rate limits and the adaptive throttling / rate limit avoidance strategy the add-on uses.
Avoid Rate Limit Warnings: Enable throttling logic that attempts to avoid exceeding API throttling warning limits
Warning Threshold Percentage: Used to adjust rate limit avoidance target. Tells add-on to use ONLY this percentage of API calls. Defaults to 50%
Throttling Threshold Pct: below this percentage of available rate limits an adaptive throttling strategy is leveraged
The strategy is as follows:
Keep in mind that rate limits are shared among clients, and we cannot assume we are the only client.
After each API call is made, the response headers are evaluated to determine what the rate limit is, the number of remaining calls and the amount of time left in the rate limit window.
If the response code is 429, we exceeded the rate limit; the client will pause for the time left in the rate limit window + 7 seconds for a safety factor (67 seconds would be the max)

If the response code is 200 (success), the client will evaluate the time left in the rate limit window along with the number of remaining calls available
If Avoid Rate Limit Warnings is enabled (please leave this enabled), the number of remaining calls evaluated from the response headers is reduced to the Warning Threshold Percentage of the actual remaining calls.
e.g. if the response header says there are 100 calls available and the Warning Threshold Percentage is set to 75%, the remaining logic will act as if there are only 75 remaining calls


To decide how long the client should pause, it makes an assumption about the number of calls per second it and other clients are making (4 calls per second)
If the calculated number of expected calls exceeds the calculated remaining calls, the client will pause more aggressively


Finally, the client will pause for the calculated pause time IF percentage of calculated available calls exceeds the defined Throttling Threshold Pct

Define Account
Using the Splunk webapp, login and launch the newly installed Okta Identity Cloud Add-on.
Before we can define an input, we must provide account credentials.  Using the Okta Domain and API Token from our Prerequisites section perform the following.

Navigate to Configuration -> Okta Accounts
Click Add
Provide a unique and appropriate Okta Account Name for the account (arbitrary value)
Enter the Okta Domain  (NOTE: domain name only e.g. yourdomain.okta.com NOT URL)
Enter the Okta API Token
Click Add

Define Input
With our Account defined we can now define and Input

Navigate to Inputs
Click Create New Input
Provide a unique and appropriate Name for the input (arbitrary value)
Provide the desired interval (60 seconds is recommended)
Choose the appropriate Index
Select Logs from the Metric dropdown (Only use Users, Groups and Apps if you have a specific use case for type of data those metrics ingest)
Select the appropriate Okta Account defined in the previous step
Click Add

Search for data
All data collected by this add-on will contain a source of Okta:im2 and the host value will be the domain of your Okta tenant (e.g. yourdomain.okta.com)
The sourcetype of the data will vary by the ""metric"" associated with the input.  Refer to this table for the sourcetype generated by specific metrics used in the input and a link / description of the type of data.

Log /api/v1/logs
This input is responsible for the ingesting all of the transactional events occurring in your Okta org it is the most important input provided by this add-on and should be configured to retrieve its data in a near real time manner.
Refer to the API documentation for a detailed explanation of the data model.  You can also review the event type catalog additional insight into the meaning of specific event types you will see.

User /api/v1/users
User objects are JSON representations of user objects in Okta Universal Directory.  This isn't a transactional stream of ""events"" relative to users, rather a sync or replica of users from Okta.  This data type can be used to enrich log data retrieved from the log input, it could also be useful for performing ad hoc and complex queries and analysis of your user population.
When this input is initially configured it will need to sync ALL of the user objects from Okta into Splunk.  On subsequent job intervals the input will only retrieve user objects that have been modified since the last collection (deltas).

Group objects are JSON representations of groups object in Okta Universal Directory, it is also used to enumerate group memberships**.  This isn't a transactional stream of ""events"" relative to groups, rather a sync or replica of groups from Okta or other connected directories and applications.  This data type  can be used to enrich log data retrieved from the log input, it could also be useful for performing ad hoc and complex queries and analysis of your groups and group memberships.
When this input is initially configured it will need to sync ALL of the group objects from Okta into Splunk.  On subsequent job intervals the input will only retrieve group objects that have been modified since the last collection (deltas).

App /api/v1/apps
App objects are JSON representations of apps objects in Okta Universal Directory, it is also used to enumerate users assigned to apps and groups related to apps -- assignment groups, groups sourced from the app or groups pushed to the app.  This isn't a transactional stream of ""events"" relative to apps, rather a sync or replica of apps as they are configured in Okta.  This data type can be used to enrich data retrieved from the log input, it could also be useful for performing ad hoc and complex queries and analysis of your apps, their configuration as well as applications assignments.

The most important system log for performance troubleshooting on Cisco WSA is a ""hidden"" prox_track. While it contains a lot of very helpful information, it cannot be configured, modified or pushed like other default log types, it must be retrieved using FTP/SCP. Cisco WSA Insight Splunk App provides visualization of prox_track and System Health (shd) logs, assists with troubleshooting of performance issues and gives insights into OS metrics. It can be used for ad-hoc troubleshooting or for continious monitoring of Cisco WSA.
===Installation and configuration===
Step-by-step Installation: https://youtu.be/aAUpTvLUI8A

Install Splunk Enterprise
Install this App
Copy prox_track.log from /track_stats/ WSA folder on you computer
On Splunk: 
prox_track Logs: App > Cisco WSA Insight, then Settings > Add Data > Upload files from my computer > Select File > Next > choose/type in ""cisco:wsa:prox_track"" source type in Source Type drop down menu, Next, type in the host name of original wsa host, Review, Submit.
the same for SHD logs, but choose cisco:wsa:shd as a sourcetype


In the App choose the time range and the wsa host

Sourcetypes

LogSourceSourcetypeInput Method
track_stats/track_stats/prox_track.logcisco:wsa:prox_trackmanual upload for ad-hoc analysisftp/scp pull + script for cont. monitoring
System Health Logsshd_logs/shd.currentcisco:wsa:shdmanual upload for ad-hoc analysissyslog streaming, ftp/scp pulling for cont. monitoring

===Special handling of track_stats/prox_track.log===
To feed into Splunk only last entries from prox_track.log use following bash script as a cron job:
#!/bin/bash
WSA_HOST=$1
DIR=/wsa_logs/  
if [ ! -d $DIR/$WSA_HOST ]; then mkdir $DIR/$WSA_HOST ; fi
cd $DIR/$WSA_HOST
timestamp=$(date +%s)
if [ ! -f timestamp.txt ]; then touch timestamp.txt ; fi
scp admin@$WSA_HOST:/track_stats/prox_track.log $timestamp
grep -A1000000 -f timestamp.txt $timestamp | grep -A1000000 -P ""^\s+ user time: "" | grep -A1000000 -E ""^Current Date: "" | grep -E -f ../patterns.txt >> prox_track.log
grep ""^Current Date:"" $timestamp | tail -1 > timestamp.txt
rm -f $timestamp

Create a file patterns.txt with following content, it used in the script as grep pattern to include only matching lines from prox_track.log file:
^Current Date:
^INFO: proxy running for 
^INFO: traffic over
^INFO: Transparent NTLMSSP

Create cronjobs to retrieve logs:
* * * * * /wsa_logs/get_prox_track.sh wsa1 &>/dev/null
* * * * * /wsa_logs/get_prox_track.sh wsa2 &>/dev/null
* * * * * /wsa_logs/get_prox_track.sh wsa3 &>/dev/null
* * * * * /wsa_logs/get_prox_track.sh wsa4 &>/dev/null

Configure cronjob to delete prox_track.log files periodically, so they aren't grow indefinitely:
0 0 * * * find /wsa_logs/ -name prox_track.log -size +10M -delete

The folder structure after setup:

Integration Considerations
Security/Access considerations
When configuring Splunk integration from Cyara Cloud Portal to Splunk Enterprise (premise) your IT organization must enable firewall access from the Cyara Cloud to your Splunk Enterprise instance. Whitelist the Cyara integration FQDN to allow connections from the Cyara Cloud to your Splunk instance. The specific port to allow the communication on is defined by the Splunk HTTP Event Collector configuration (commonly 8088):


US FQDN: egress-ips.cyaraportal.us
AU FQDN: egress-ips.cyaraportal.com
UK FQDN: egress-ips.cyaraportal.co.uk


Cyara Portal Integrations Feature
To enable the Splunk integration, the Integrations feature must be enabled for your Cyara Cloud Portal Account.
To check if the Integration feature is enabled, from the Cyara Portal page toolbar access Tools/Integrations page. If you see the message informing you that ""Integrations Not Configured,"" please contact Cyara Support (support@cyara.com) and request that the Integrations be enabled for your account.
Configuration
At a high level, there are 3 steps to setup the Cyara to Splunk Integration:


Setup the Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC)
Create/configure an Impersonation User
Configure the Cyara to Splunk Integration


Setting up the Splunk HEC (Splunk Console)


In your Splunk Instance choose Settings > Data Inputs.
From the Local Input types select Add New HTTP Event Collector
Configure the collector using the default values as follows

Name: (Enter a name to remember this integration, we recommend ""Cyara Pulse Monitoring"")
Indexer Acknowledgement should not be enabled (if this is set to enabled, the integration will result in a Bad Request)
Select Source Type

Structured
_json



Default Index: cyara

Note: It is highly recommended to create and use an index named ""cyara"" as it is the default index being used in the Cyara Pulse App for Splunk. However, if you already have your Cyara data in a different index, you will need to modify a single 
search macro to include the alternate index. To do so, go to: Settings > Advanced Search > Search Macros > Default index, and change the definition field from index=cyara to the name of your index.






Click Review
Click Submit
The success screen will show a Token Value that you will need later for posting events to your collector.
Check that the event collector is enabled. To enable, navigate back to your Data Inputs section by clicking Settings > Data Inputs > HTTP Event Collector and click on ""Enable"" located in the Actions column.


Adding an Impersonation User (Cyara Portal)
Before configuring the integration, you need to configure ""Impersonation."" Impersonation defines an account user on whose behalf the integration will leverage Cyara APIs. While you can designate any actual user for the impersonation, it is recommended that you create a designated user just for that role (e.g. integration.user).
To add a new Impersonation User to your Cyara Platform, follow these steps.


Click on Tools > Integrations menu in the Cyara Portal.
Click on Impersonation in the drop-down menu on the right.
Select the user that should be impersonated (That Cyara Integrations will authenticate as when pushing/pulling data via the Cyara API).


Configuring Cyara to Splunk Integration (Cyara Portal)
Once you have configured the Impersonation User, you are now set to configure an integration with Splunk!
Follow the steps below:


In Cyara Portal navigate to Tools > Integrations in the Top Menu. (If ""Integrations"" doesn't appear in the Tools menu, confirm that you have Cyara Integrations enabled).
Click the New Integration button
Integration Details

Select Splunk from the Type dropdown menu
Enter a Name and a Description for this integration (We recommend Cyara Pulse Monitoring for the name, and a rich description of the type of service being monitored).
From the Impersonate User pull-down menu select the user that will be impersonated for the API access
Select which Pulse Dashboard should be used as the primary source of data to be pushed to Splunk. To ensure that all available Pulse results get pushed to Splunk you can select the predefined Global Dashboard. You can select other dashboards that you created, but remember that only events being monitored by that dashboard will be pushed to Splunk.



Splunk Details

For Api Uri, enter the Splunk API URL (example https://my_splunk_instance:8088/services/collector)
For Authorization Token, enter the token that was generated when you created HEC
Click the ""Test Authentication"" button to validate your Splunk Credentials. If access, API Url and Token are configured correctly you should see a ✓ indicating a successful validation.



Event Field Selection

This section maps Cyara Data Variables to the Data Fields that will be sent to Splunk in a JSON document
Starting with Cyara 20.3 release, all data field mapping will be pre-populated by default, so you do not have to make any changes (see example below)



Make sure that the newly configured integration is Enabled. By default, all integrations are disabled
Click on Save Details.
Your integration is complete.

This Splunk App provides a Custom Search Command named cyberchef that allows you to apply CyberChef operations and recipes to your events.  This App also provides a local version of the CyberChef web GUI.
Quick Example:
| makeresults count=3 
 | streamstats count
 | eval data=random()/random() 
 | cyberchef infield='data' outfield='convertedData' operation=""ToBase64"" 
 | table data convertedData
When you run the above example, you'll get something like the following output:



data
convertedData




1.267541990694
MS4yNjc1NDE5OTA2OTQ=


1.233951602074389
MS4yMzM5NTE2MDIwNzQzODk=


1.738851991598791
MS43Mzg4NTE5OTE1OTg3OTE=



Here we generate three results with random data in the 'data' field (the first three lines of SPL). We then use CyberChef's toBase64 operation to convert the values in the 'data' field into base-64 representation, and save the results to the 'convertedData' field. Finally, we display the data in a table.
Installation
You should install this App on all your Splunk Indexers and Search Heads (there is no benefit or harm to installing it on any forwarders).  You must reboot Splunk after installation. No configuration is required to use this App.
This App runs on Windows and Linux, and works with Splunk versions 7.3 - 8.2.
Usage
This App will allow you to apply CyberChef operations and recipes through a custom search command named cyberchef.  This custom search command requires that you specify the input field to operate on, the CyberChef operation or recipe to apply to the data in that field, and optionally a different output field to write the results to.
In the simplest usage: the following SPL will apply the ""toBase64"" operation to the ""inData"" field, and save the results back to the ""inData"" field (overwriting the original field).
... | cyberchef infield='inData' operation=""ToBase64"" |...
There are four ways to specify the CyberChef operation or recipe to use. You must choose one of these parameters:
1. operation:  A single operation with no parameters.
2. jsonRecipe: A recipe saved as compact json.
3. encodedRecipe:  A recipe saved as compact json, then converted to base64. 
4. savedRecipe:  A recipe in saved as compact json, saved to a text file located in this App's ./local/recipes/ folder.
A CyberChef operation is a single function applied to the specified field for each event from your data. For example: converting data from a base64-encoded string using the FromBase64 operation.
A CyberChef recipe is one or more operations chained together, where each operation can have optional parameters.  For example: converting data into a base64-encoded string (using the ToBase64 operation), and then calculating the SHA3 hash with an output size of 256 of that base64 encoded data using the SHA3 operation with the 256 output-size option.
Recipes (versus an operation) must be formatted in CyberChef's compact json format (more information below), which can be done through the CyberChef web GUI.
Please make sure to read the section below titled Charsets, Quotes, and Escaped Characters and Parameter ordering before you try to use this app to avoid errors, as parameter ordering is important.
operation parameter
This is the simplest method, and allows you to apply a single CyberChef operation without any parameters.
From the CyberChef node.js API documentation:  Operation names are camelCase versions of the operations on the web app, except for when the operation name begins with more than one uppercase character. For example, ""Zlib Deflate"" becomes zlibDeflate, but ""SHA2"" stays as SHA2.  That being said: this App's implementation of CyberChef is really flexible with naming, see the section below CyberChef Operation Names.
... | cyberchef infield='inData' operation=""ToBase64"" |...
If you want to save the results to a different (or newly created field), include the 'outfield' parameter:
... | cyberchef infield='inData' outfield=outData operation=""ToBase64"" |...
jsonRecipe parameter
If you need to use multiple operations (a recipe), or your operations require non-default parameters, you can't use the operation parameter. One way to solve this is with the jsonRecipe parameter. This allows you to specify a complete recipe in your SPL command.  The recipe is formated in compact-json.
To create this json string: From the CyberChef GUI, construct your recipe by dragging the operations you want to the ""recipe"" section.  Once the recipe is correct: click the ""save"" icon at the top (the floppy disc icon), and then select the ""compact json"" tab. This is the compact-json representation of this recipe, and is what to use for this parameter.
An example:
... | cyberchef infield='inData' outfield=""outData"" jsonRecipe=""[{""op"":""To Base64"",""args"":[""A-Za-z0-9+/=""]}]"" |...
encodedRecipe parameter
This is similar to the jsonRecipe paraemter, except the recipe is encoded in base64 format (this is helpful if you have parameters in your recipe that aren't part of the ASCII character set).
To create this base64 string: Just like above, From the CyberChef GUI, construct your recipe by dragging the operations you want to the ""recipe"" section.  once the recipe is correct: click the ""save"" icon at the top (the floppy disc icon), and then select the ""compact json"" tab. This is the compact-json representation of this recipe. You then need to convert that json string into a base64-encoded string (using the CyberChef GUI and the ToBase64 operation), and use the result for this field.
For example, if you wanted a recipe to convert a string from base64 and then generate the SHA2 hash, you would build this recipe in the CyberChef GUI, click the ""save"" button, click on the ""compact json"" tab to get the following recipe in compact json format:
[{""op"":""From Base64"",""args"":[""A-Za-z0-9+/="",true]},{""op"":""SHA3"",""args"":[""512""]}]
Next: You need to convert this json string into a base64 encoded string (using CyberChef's toBase64 function in the GUI). This gives us the following string:
W3sib3AiOiJGcm9tIEJhc2U2NCIsImFyZ3MiOlsiQS1aYS16MC05Ky89Iix0cnVlXX0seyJvcCI6IlNIQTMiLCJhcmdzIjpbIjUxMiJdfV0=
that string is now the value for the encodedRecipe parameter:
... | cyberchef infield = 'inData' encodedrecipe = ""W3sib3AiOiJGcm9tIEJhc2U2NCIsImFyZ3MiOlsiQS1aYS16MC05Ky89Iix0cnVlXX0seyJvcCI6IlNIQTMiLCJhcmdzIjpbIjUxMiJdfV0="" |...
savedRecipe parameter
If you find yourself using the same recipes over and over, you can save them in this App's ""./local/recipe"" folder with a nickname to easily reference them. 
first create a ./local/recipe/myRecipes.txt text file.  In this file, add the following content:
# Comment: the line below is a recipe you can reference from the CyberChef custom search command
myComplexRecipe  :  [{""op"":""SHA3"",""args"":[""512""]}]
You don't need to reboot Splunk to use these recipes, but you need to make sure the recipe is avaliable on all your Splunk servers. Run the following SPL to reference this recipe:
... | cyberchef infield = 'inData' recipe = ""myComplexRecipe"" |...
To test this, I have made two savedRecipe examples avaliable. The First coverts the event to moorse code:
... | cyberchef infield='inData' recipe=example_moorse  |...
the second example converts the event to to base64, then to moorse code:
... | cyberchef infield='inData' recipe=example_xml_moorse  |...
You can have as many text files you want, with as many saved recipes as you want.  This App will parse all text files in the ./local/recipe/ folder for recipes.  The first matching recipe name will be used.
See the ./default/recipes/READEME.txt file included with this App for more details.
outfield parameter
This optional parameter specifies which field to write the results of the CyberChef operation or recipe to.  If you don't specify this field, then the results will be written back to the field specified by the infield parameter.  You can specify an existing or new field with this parameter. If the field already exists, the value will be overwritten with the results. If the field does not exist, it will be created in your results.  If CyberChef is not able to process the data in your infield (say you tried to apply an invalid operation to your data), the outfield will be blank for that event.
... | cyberchef infield='inData' outfield='modifiedData' operation=""ToBase64"" |...
Debug parameter
This optional parameter can either be set to full for full debug information (including the contennt of messages passed between splunk and this app, including the data from your events), or to info for the same information, excluding the actual data sent and received.  The debug information is saved to a file named debug.log in the search's dispatch directory.  If you have a problem and are requesting assitance, you'll probably want to include the debug log.
... | cyberchef infield='inData' debug=full operation=""ToBase64"" |...
... | cyberchef infield='inData' debug=info outfield='modifiedData' operation=""ToBase64"" |...
Important Notes
Parameter Ordering
You must start with the infield parameter, followed by the optional outfield and debug parameters. You must end with one of the four recipe/operation parameters listed above.  If you don't follow this order, you will get an error (this ordering makes it easier to parse the SPL and minimizes the number of characters you need to escape in your SPL).
Charsets, Quotes, and Escaped Characters
This command only supports the ASCII characterset in the SPL (but can support any Unicode characters in your data). What this means is that your fieldnames and your recipes must be ASCII chars; essentially if you type it in as SPL, it must be ASCII. If you have non-ASCII characters in your json or recipe, you can either use the encodedreipce or savedrecipe option to run the command. 
This command should be able to handle most types of quotes for field names (infield and outfield).  If your field name only has alphanumeric characters (the \w character set), you don't need to quote it, otherwise use single-quotes for your field names.  For fieldnames, you must escape the single-quote and the pipe character.  For example, if you have a field named a|b, and you wanted to save the output to a field named b 'or' a, your command would be:
... | cyberchef infield='a\|b' outfield='b \'or\' a' ...
For the encodedRecipe parameter, you don't need quotes (but they won't hurt).
For the savedRecipe and command parameters, if the name is only alphanumeric (\w), you don't need quotes.  If you have any other characters or spaces, you should enclose the string in single or double-quotes. The Pipe in the string must be escaped with a backslash.
Basically: when in doubt, use single-quotes. Fieldnames need the single quote and pipe escaped with a backslash, and the command you use only needs the pipe escaped.
CyberChef Operation Names
CyberChef is really flexible about how you specify the operation name with regard to case sensitivity and spaces. All of the following work fine when specifying the operation:
ToBase64, toBase64, tOBaSe64, ""to base 64"", ""to Base64"", ""toB ase 64"".  
Essentially CyberChef ignores case and spaces when determining the command you want. If you include spaces, quote the operation. Don't include the parenthesis for the operation.  Unfortunately you can't specify any parameters for the operation (use a recipe or encodedRecipe if you require that). This is due to a way that Splunk parses the SPL before sending it to the custom search command. 
CyberChef Operations
This App should support all CyberChef operations offered by the CyberChef node.js API, which exclude only a few commands.  This App uses Splunk's version of node (8.16), which isn't officially supported by CyberChef, but all the CyberChef unit tests passed, so there shouldn't be any problem running any of the supported CyberChef operations.
Performance: While you could chain multiple CyberChef operations together like this:
... | cyberchef infield='x' operation='fromBase64"" | cyberchef infield='x' operation='SHA3'  |  ...
You should avoid this when possible since there is a performance impact. Each time you run the cyberchef custom search command: there is a delay as the libraries are loaded (twice in the above example).  It will be much more efficent to use one of the other recipe parameters rather than the operation parameter multiple times.  Once the CyberChef libraries are loaded for a command, the processing tends to be relatively fast.
CyberChef Web GUI
This App provides a local version of the CyberChef Web GUI. It can be found by opening the App in Splunk Web, and clicking the link in the Nav Bar for CyberChef.
Support
Please submit bug and feature requests via Github, or email Noah@SublimeRobots.com.  Please include as much information as possible with your request.  This App is not professionally supported (it is a volunteer project), so issues may not be fixed immediately, but I will make every effort to reply.
This app implements version 2 of Splunk's custom search protocol manually (since there's no SDK for node.js), which I had to reverse-engineer with limited documentation.  Therefore, there are very likely some edge cases that you will run into that need to be fixed.  Please submit them via Github with as much information as possible (that will allow me to easily re-create and fix the issue).
Future releases of this App will focus on bug-fixes and performance (since it's not effectively leveraging node's asynchronous functionality effectively).

This app can be used to analyze the volatility 2.6 JSON output of multiple hosts at the same time. 
After you import the data into Splunk using the TA-volatility app you can use the three dashboards provided to perform triage and identify low hanging fruits.
Three dashboards are provided:
- Overview: a general view of all imported imaged with for example a network graph, all unique IPs, processes, and commandlines.
- Host Analyzer: choose an host to get a detailed view about possible rogue processes, network artifacts, code injection and others.
- Process Analyzer: a dashboard which provide a drill down based on a particular process ID. You can have in one dashboard the output of the volatility plugins for the choosen process.
The app also introduces some helpful resources like:
- a command called ""malfindtoasm"" which will display the ""data"" filed of the malfind command as Assembly Code directly in Splunk
- Two CSV which contains the drivers found the installation of Windows 2012R2x64 and Windows 10x64 which can be used to diff the results obtained from volatility
In order for the dasboards to work properly you have to import the output of the following plugins:
- imageinfo
- malfind
- ldrmodules 
- netscan
- modscan
- cmdline
- pslist
- pstree
- psxview
- driverirp
For the ""yarascan"" module, you have first to parse the output of the plugin and manually generate (unfortunately there is no JSON output for Yara in volatility) a JSON that looks like:
    ""{""rows"":[[""win_registry"",""csrss.exe"",14],[""win_registry"",""csrss.exe"",2],[""win_registry"",""winlogon.exe"",1]......],""columns"":[""rule"",""process_name"",""pid""]}""

Add-on Homepage:
Author: Hurricane Labs
Version: 1.0.7
Description
The purpose of this add-on is to provide CIM compliant field extractions for Cisco Umbrella OpenDNS logs AWS S3 bucket logs.
This add-on requires the Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services as the means of data on-boarding.

Built for Splunk Enterprise 6.x.x or higher
CIM Compliance (CIM 4.0.0 or higher)
Ready for Enterprise Security
Requires Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (unless using Cisco Managed S3)
https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876/


Supports Cisco Umbrella Log Management Version 1-5

INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
Search Head: Required
Heavy Forwarder: Optional
Indexer: Optional
Universal Forwarder: Not Supported
Light Forwarder: Not Supported
Ultimately this add-on needs to be installed on your Search Head and on the AWS Add-on collection point. It is recommended that you setup the AWS inputs on a Heavy Forwarder, and it is recommended that you setup the Cisco Umbrella Add-on on the Heavy Forwarder and Search Head. If you are using your Search Head as the AWS collection point, then this only needs to go on your search head. If your AWS collection point is on your Indexer, then this add-on needs to go on the Indexer and on your Search Head.
Setting up AWS Input
Reference Link: https://support.umbrella.com/hc/en-us/articles/230650987-Configuring-Splunk-for-use-with-Cisco-Umbrella-Log-Management-in-AWS-S3
1. Refer to the reference link to configure AWS and set up the account in Splunk, you can follow the rest of the steps in this guide when you reach the ""Configuring Data Inputs for Splunk"" step.
2. Navigate to the Splunk Add-on for AWS
3. Create a new input (Custom Data Type > Generic S3)
4. Select the appropriate AWS Account/Role/S3 Bucket
5. (Recommended) Do not set a S3 Key Prefix, and change the sourcetype to ""opendns:s3"".
5. (Optional) If you want more control over the data you bring in, you'll need to do separate inputs using these S3 Key Prefixes ""/proxylogs/"", ""/dnslogs/"", ""/firewalllogs/"", ""/auditlogs/"" and ""/iplogs/"". Each of these will use it's own sourcetype: ""opendns:dnslogs"", ""opendns:proxylogs"", ""opendns:firewalllogs"", ""opendns:auditlogs"", and ""opendns:iplogs""
Heavy Forwarder & Search Head (RECOMMENDED)

Install the add-on on the Heavy Forwarder and Search Head. A Splunk Restart may be required, you may also attempt a debug refresh.
Configure the AWS Input to scrape your OpenDNS S3 bucket;
2a. One Input: If you scrape the entire bucket, you NEED to use sourcetype ""opendns:s3""
2b. Multiple Inputs: If you want more control over the buckets being scraped, this add-on supports multiple inputs. There are three types of logs sent by Umbrella OpenDNS; ""/proxylogs/"", ""/dnslogs/"", ""/firewalllogs/"", ""/auditlogs/"" and ""/iplogs/"". Each input should use exactly one of those prefixes. The respective sourcetypes for those prefixes are as follows; ""opendns:dnslogs"", ""opendns:proxy"", ""opendns:firewalllogs"", ""opendns:auditlogs"" and ""opendns:iplogs"".
Verify data is coming in and you are seeing the proper field extractions by searching the data.
Example Search: index=awsindexyouchose sourcetype=opendns:* | dedup sourcetype

Search Head Only

Install the add-on on the Search Head. A Splunk Restart may be required, you may also attempt a debug refresh.
Configure the AWS Input to scrape your OpenDNS S3 bucket;
2a. One Input: If you scrape the entire bucket, you NEED to use sourcetype ""opendns:s3""
2b. Multiple Inputs: If you want more control over the buckets being scraped, this add-on supports multiple inputs. There are three types of logs sent by Umbrella OpenDNS; ""/proxylogs/"", ""/dnslogs/"", ""/firewalllogs/"", ""/auditlogs/"" and ""/iplogs/"". Each input should use exactly one of those prefixes. The respective sourcetypes for those prefixes are as follows; ""opendns:dnslogs"", ""opendns:proxy"", ""opendns:firewalllogs"", ""opendns:auditlogs"" and ""opendns:iplogs"".
Verify data is coming in and you are seeing the proper field extractions by searching the data.
Example Search: index=awsindexyouchose sourcetype=opendns:* | dedup sourcetype

Indexer and Search Head (NOT RECOMMENDED)

Install the add-on on the Indexer and Search Head. A Splunk Restart may be required, you may also attempt a debug refresh.
Configure the AWS Input to scrape your OpenDNS S3 bucket;
2a. One Input: If you scrape the entire bucket, you NEED to use sourcetype ""opendns:s3""
2b. Multiple Inputs: If you want more control over the buckets being scraped, this add-on supports multiple inputs.

Cisco Managed Buckets Instructions
Reference Links:
https://support.umbrella.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000739983-How-to-Downloading-logs-from-Cisco-Umbrella-Log-Management-using-the-AWS-CLI
https://support.umbrella.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001388406-Configuring-Splunk-with-a-Cisco-managed-S3-Bucket
The AWS Add-on can NOT be used to pull data from Cisco managed S3 buckets. The only way to get this data in is through the use of the awscli tool. This should be setup on a Splunk Enterprise system that is meant for data ingestion (such as a Heavy Forwarder). You need to install this add-on on your Search Heads and the system handling data ingestion. The steps below will ONLY apply to your data ingestion box, NOT your Search Heads. I have only tested this on Ubuntu and we will not provide any further support/guidance on this, these steps are provided as is:
-1. Install awscli via apt-get (apt-get install awscli)
-2. In $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-cisco_umbrella/bin create two shell scripts. If you want the shell script write to a different location, make sure you change the paths in both shell scripts!
pull-umbrella-logs.sh
#!/bin/sh
unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH
unset PYTHONPATH
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<KEY\_HERE> AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<KEY_HERE> AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<REGION_HERE> aws s3 sync s3://<CISCO_BUCKET_PATH_HERE> /opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-cisco_umbrella/data
delete-old-umbrella-logs.sh
#!/bin/bash
#Removes old data depending on the ""Retention Duration"" configured in the Umbrella dashboard --> Admin --> Log Management:
a) 7 days:
find /opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-cisco_umbrella/data -type f -name ""*.csv.gz"" -mmin +11520 -delete 2>&1 >/dev/null
b) 14 days:
find /opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-cisco_umbrella/data -type f -name ""*.csv.gz"" -mmin +21600 -delete 2>&1 >/dev/null
c) 30 days:
find /opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-cisco_umbrella/data -type f -name ""*.csv.gz"" -mmin +44640 -delete 2>&1 >/dev/null
The suggested values leave a one day buffer for safety.
#Removes old directories with no data
rmdir /opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-cisco_umbrella/data/dnslogs/*
-3. Verify that Splunk is actually able to run the shell scripts without issue by running '$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk cmd sh $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-cisco_umbrella/pull-umbrella-logs.sh'. If this does not work, there is a problem with your setup or keys.
-4. If you are using a different path than my example, you will need to create $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-cisco_umbrella/local/props.conf and alter this stanza to match:
[source::/opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-cisco_umbrella/data/dnslogs/...]
TRANSFORMS-umbrella-logs_source = remove_umbrella_date_from_source
-5. In $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-cisco_umbrella/local/inputs.conf create the following stanzas. Make sure you change the path and index in the monitor stanza if necessary!
[script://./bin/pull-umbrella-logs.sh]
disabled = 0
interval = 300
index = _internal
sourcetype = cisco:umbrella:input
start_by_shell = false
[script://./bin/delete-old-umbrella-logs.sh]
disabled = 0
interval = 600
index = _internal
sourcetype = cisco:umbrella:cleanup
start_by_shell = false
[monitor:///opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-cisco_umbrella/data/dnslogs/*/*.csv.gz]
disabled = 0
index = opendns
sourcetype = opendns:dnslogs
-6. Verify data is coming in and you are seeing the proper field extractions by searching the data.
----Example Search: index=awsindexyouchose sourcetype=opendns:dnslogs
----Note: You can look for script output by searching: index=_internal sourcetype=cisco:umbrella:*

The Dragos Splunk extensions for Worldview Threat Intelligence are split into two parts.
The Dragos Technology Add-on provides the necessary logic to read and store Worldview IoCs in a Splunk key value store or index.  Splunk users can craft custom queries themselves or leverage the Dragos Worldview Threat Intelligence App.
The Worldview Threat Intelligence App searches log data combining the Dragos IoCs and customer data to leverage the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM). The App presents the results as a series of dashboards that are user-customizable to fit individual needs.
The Splunk Add-on and Threat Intelligence app allow users to search log data collected from both enterprise IT and industrial Operational Technology (OT) networks. This combined view gives users a unified experience when searching their data for IOCs, providing analysts with improved situational awareness and decision-making support.
This expands the ICS cybersecurity ecosystem to ensure critical infrastructure and industrial organizations are equipped with enhanced threat visibility and better analytics, resulting in better protection of their OT environments - regardless of where an adversary may attack. It enables more effective SOC functions - more effective threat hunts, ability to resolve incidents more quickly - for organizations concerned about ICS cybersecurity.",Version 1.1.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/b3a5c1f4-6e66-11ec-8515-baef23ea9185.png,"IT Operations, IoT & Industrial Data",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,220,0,splunk,0,0,Dragos Inc,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/dragosinc,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

== SplunkForUverse App ==
The SplunkForUverse App is available for download on Splunk Apps (http://apps.splunk.com) and is packaged as a standard Splunk application.  The primary goal of the application is to parse inbound syslog data generated by the AT&T U-verse modem and display the reults in a single UI.  The firewall data details who is knocking on your door and who is making into your network if you have pinholes configured that allow to to share internal services to the internet.
The SplunkForUverse app provides the following:

Categorization of events into distinct eventtypes to make search for just ""firewall"" or ""voice"" events easier.
A Single default dashboard that provides a high level overview of the system.  A couple of the panels may take a few seconds to load because reverse DNS looksups are being performed on firewall related source IP addrsses.
Pre-defined scheduled searches.  If you have your system configured to relay mail, you send send yourself daily reports.
Extractions via props.conf that parse the messages

== Dependencies ==
None, other than getting your data input setup correctly (manual source and sourcetype assignment).
== System Requirements ==
This App has been tested to function on 64 bit Linux installs running a 6.X version of Splunk as well as on Windows.  The U-verse modem used to generate events:  Manufacturer=Pace Plc, Model 3800HGV-B, Hardware Version=2700-100531-006, and Software Version=6.11.1.29-plus.tm.  The events that are being generated by the model have the following general format:  ""Apr 19 10:31:30 192.168.1.254 Apr 19 10:32:43 192.168.1.254 ............."". 
==  Modem Configuration ==

Log into your AT&T U-verse modem via the https interface
Click on the Settings tab
Click on the Diagnostics tab
Click on the Syslog tab
Set the Server Address to be the IP Address of your Splunk indexer
Set the Server Port to be the custom UDP port that your indexer is configured to listen on

== SplunkForUverse App Configuration ==

Create a Data Input (Settings->Data Inputs->UDP) to receive the syslog events from the modem on a unique port number.
Make sure your source and sourcetype for the above input are set to ""u-verse"" (without the quotes).  The eventtypes depend on sourcetype=u-verse and the dashboards depend on source=u-verse.  This is done to make life easier when dumping the incoming u-verse events into you main index.",Version 1.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/47fa5cfe-0aa4-11e4-aec8-06bef1d648a7.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance, Utilities",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,549,0,splunk,0,0,Jim Apger,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/apgersplunk1,"Products: Splunk Enterprise

Configuration Walk-through
Let's walk through how to configure Oversight to create inventory lookups based on data already in Splunk.
Given the following events exist in index=main sourcetype=syslog:
{""ip"": ""3.3.3.3"", ""syslog_server"": ""syslog2"",""loglevel"": ""ERROR"", ""message"": ""watchdog detected hang"", ""time"": ""2021-08-01 02:22:00.000""}
{""ip"": ""1.1.1.1"", ""syslog_server"": ""syslog1"",""loglevel"": ""INFO"", ""message"": ""system power off"", ""time"": ""2021-08-01 02:20:00.000""}
{""ip"": ""2.2.2.2"", ""syslog_server"": ""syslog2"",""loglevel"": ""INFO"", ""message"": ""user logged in"", ""userid"":123, ""time"": ""2021-08-01 02:05:00.000""}
{""ip"": ""1.1.1.1"", ""syslog_server"": ""syslog1"", ""loglevel"": ""DEBUG"", ""message"": ""system rebooting"", ""time"": ""2021-08-01 02:00:00.000""}
Create the following Input:
Name: syslog
Source Expression: index=main sourcetype=syslog
Source Expression Fields: syslog_server
Unique ID Field: ip
Inventory Source: [leave box checked]
Cron Schedule: [update to execute daily a few minutes from now]

Click <Save>
The custom script will now execute in the background, creating the collection, transforms, macros, 
and the scheduled savedsearches necessary to collect and aggregate inventory information from this set of events.
The savedsearch will execute on the cron schedule you specified.  Check the contents using the 
| inputlookup syslog_lookup or | inputlookup hosts_lookup in the search bar.
Also be sure to enable the expire_inventory saved search as it is disabled by default.
Walk-through Lookup Table Contents
With the above Input defined and data present, we would get the lookup table output below after the saved search executes for the first time:

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1732,2022-01-10,07:25:52 AM,Add-on for Postgres,,"March 6, 2014","Introduction
This add-on dedicated to PostgreSQL monitoring. It is intended to provide deep dive into PostgreSQL database internals and metrics. Most of information is a base for App for Postgres appliaction with fancy dashboards and useful macros on board
Prerequisites
You need to have psycopg2 python module installed on your system as well as python itself (version 2.6 or later).
Installation
In order to collect data from the PostgreSQL servers, you need the Add-on for Postgres. This add-on should be installed onto the universal forwarder (or searchhead or indexer) from which you want to collect PostgreSQL data. The Add-on for PostgreSQL is available from Splunk Apps.
The Add-on for PostgreSQL provides data inputs for PostgreSQL server which facilitate retrieving data from PostgreSQL standard statistic views (as pg_stat and pg_statio table) and from standard PostgreSQL server logs.  
To start the PostgresSQL server monitoring you should follow theese steps:

Create database user dedicated to read data from PostgreSQL statistic views.

Enable extensive query logging in PostgreSQL. To do so you have to change the following entries in your postgresql.conf

log_file_mode = 640 – change in order to access PostgreSQL logs if Splunk isr unning on non-root user account, apart of this Splunk user must be in an appropriate supplementary group (default: 600)
log_min_duration_statement = 0 – change in order to log all SQL statements executed by the server; the value represents minimal query duration to be recorded by logger; by default logging of SQL statements is disabled at all (default: -1)
log_line_prefix = '%m pid=%p database=%d user=%u rhost=%h tid=%v sessionid=%c ' – change in order to provide some useful fields automatically extracted by Splunk (remember of trailing space in the defined string)

After changes the are applied, restart PostgreSQL server and verify the results in log files.


Install the Add-on for Postgres onto the universal forwarder from which you want to collect PostgreSQL data

Set database connection parameters. Copy $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ta-postgres/default/postgrestats.conf to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ta-postgres/local/postgrestats.conf and customize the connection options.
Turn on your PostgreSQL log files monitoring by adding ""monitor"" stanza in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ta-postgres/local/inputs.conf. Let's say your log files are in: /var/lib/pgsql/9.3/data/pg_log directory and the name of each file log is similar to: postgres-Mon.log. In such case your monitor stanza can look like this:

[monitor:///var/lib/pgsql/9.3/data/pg_log/postgresql-*.log]  
  disabled = false  
  sourcetype = postgresql
After changes are applied, restart Splunk Universal Forwarder
Use cases
This Add-on was designed to provide data to App for Postgres application - visit it's page on splunkbase for more details.
It can also be used as a source for custom reports and dashboard to monitor database perfromance, produce performance and analysis reports.

Who is this app for?
This app is for anyone who wants an easy way to display a choropleth map without needing to know anything about KML files.
A choropleth map is a type of chart where areas are shaded in proportion to an aggregate variable that represents a geographic characteristic within each area. E.g. showing average temperature by state, or income per-capita.
Simple Maps Viz requires using a lookup that comes with the app. You can use the lookup with the | iplocation command to plot countries on the world map.
How does the app work?
This app provides a visualization that you can use in your own apps and dashboards.
To use it in your dashboards, simply install the app, and create a search that provides the values you want to display.
A lookup comes with the app that lists all the codes for the country areas. You can either use the lookup directly, or create a new lookup using a specific map's codes.
Usecases for the Simple Maps Visualization:

Showing the source country for IP based lookups
Showing the relative difference in sales by geographical region
Comparing different states' response times for monitored applications

The following fields can be used in the search:
 code (required): The code for the map element being defined - e.g. ""AU-VIC"" for Victoria, Australia. These codes are listed in the following lookup: simple-maps-viz-lookup
 value (required): The numeric value for the map element
Example Search
index=web sourcetype=access_combined
| iplocation clientip
| stats count as value by Country
| lookup simple-maps-viz-lookup name as Country output code
| table code, value

Once you have selected the map you would like to use, you need to be able to associate the specific codes for each geographical region.
You can either use the global lookup: simple-maps-viz-lookup or create your own version with the required codes.
Use the Examples dashboard to see what codes are required for each map, and optionally export the list for use in your own lookup by clicking the  icon at the bottom of the panel.
Tokens
Tokens are generated each time you click a cell (also configurable in the Drilldowns menu). This can be useful if you want to populate another panel on the dashboard with a custom search, or link to a new dashboard with the tokens carrying across.

Documentation
Detailed documentation can be found at: https://seynur.github.io/DA-ESS-MitreContent/
Overview
This application provides compliance and triage dashboards for MITRE ATT&CK Framework with drill-down capabilities. It is recommended to utilize Splunk Enterprise Security(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/263/) and Splunk ES Content Update (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3449/); however, starting with version 2.3.0 non-ES deployments are also supported with Alert Manager (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2665/) integration.
Required Splunk Apps:
Starting with version 2.3.0, we added support for non-ES (Enterprise Security App) deployments as well.
One of the following applications is required:
- Splunk Enterprise Security 5.2 or above (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/263/)
_OR_


Alert Manager (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2665/)

For one of the views:
- Sankey Diagram - Custom Visualization (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3112/)
Recommended Splunk Apps:

Splunk ES Content Update 1.0.40 or above (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3449/)
Lookup File Editor (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1724/)

Note: Although the app will work without ES Content Update, it is highly recommended since it comes with many correlation rules that have mitre_attack annotations already.
Setup Instructions
After installation of the application you will be on Setup page.  Review your desired configuration for scheduled searches and simply hit Save to continue.  Default view will be the Compliance Dashboard.  If the matrix is not populated, click on the table to run manually, which will direct you to the Lookup Generation dashboard (searches run automatically on that dashboard).
Note: If using Alert Manager app, you will need to uncheck Use Enterprise Security App checkbox within Setup view.
Saved Searches
This application comes with predefined saved searches.  Lookup Gen searches are scheduled to run  daily after midnight.  The main ones that are used by views:
- MITRE ATT&CK All Rules and Techniques Lookup Gen: This lookup generator checks currently enabled correlation rules via analytic stories and combines the searches with user-defined mitre_user_rule_technique_lookup.csv file that matches MITRE ATT&CK technique IDs with rules.
- MITRE ATT&CK Compliance Lookup Gen: This lookup generator relies on mitre_all_rule_technique_lookup.csv in order to generate a new lookup to properly display MITRE ATT&CK Compliance martix.

The ExtraHop Add-On for Splunk enables you to export ExtraHop wire data metrics as Splunk events. You can export metrics about any activity group, device group, or application from an ExtraHop Discover or Command appliance. After the Splunk platform indexes the events, you can analyze the data through the dashboards in the ExtraHop App for Splunk or by creating your own visualizations.
The ExtraHop Add-On for Splunk collects 30-second metrics through the ExtraHop REST API. Dataset metrics are collected for 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles. All events collected by the ExtraHop Add-On for Splunk are assigned the extrahop source type.

Install the ExtraHop App for Splunk
After you install the ExtraHop Add-On for Splunk, we recommend that you install the ExtraHop App for Splunk to help you configure the ExtraHop Add-On. The ExtraHop App creates default inputs to collect metrics about HTTP, DNS, and storage activity and builds dashboards to display that information.
For more information about the ExtraHop App for Splunk, see https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3939/. 
Create metric inputs for the ExtraHop Add-On for Splunk
You must create data inputs that collect information from an ExtraHop appliance to retrieve wire data metrics.

On the Splunk Web home screen, click the ExtraHop Add-On for Splunk icon in the navigation bar to launch the add-on.
Click Inputs.
Click Create New Input.
In the Add ExtraHop Add-On for Splunk window, specify settings for the input
Note: Each input can only collect metrics for a single metric category. If you want to collect metrics for multiple categories, you must create multiple inputs.
Click Add.

Create a data input for detections
The ExtraHop Add-On for Splunk contains a sourcetype for ExtraHop detections. In order to receive detections in Splunk, you must configure a data input for ExtraHop detections and configure the ExtraHop Detection SIEM Connector on your ExtraHop Command or Discover appliance.
Configure a data input in Splunk
Detection data can be sent from a Command or Discover appliance to Splunk through the syslog protocol. Complete the procedure in the Splunk documentation to get data from a TCP or UDP port. You must set the source type value to extrahop-detection.
Configure the ExtraHop Detection SIEM Connector
Follow the instructions on the ExtraHop Detection SIEM Connector bundle page to configure your ExtraHop appliance to send detections data to Splunk.

Getting Started With the CloudPassage App

How the CloudPassage App Works
Prerequisites
A. Install the CloudPassage App
Get the App through the Splunk Apps
Get the App from the Halo Toolbox
Verify the installation


B. Configure and Activate the CloudPassage App
Retrieve and save your CloudPassage API key
Configure the App in Splunk


C. View Halo Events in Splunk

This document describes the CloudPassage App for Splunk Enterprise and explains how to set up, configure, and get started using the App.
How the CloudPassage App Works
The purpose of the CloudPassage App for Splunk Enterprise is to import Halo event data into Splunk Enterprise and allow it to be manipulated by Splunk users and displayed on Halo-specific pages within Splunk Enterprise. The App includes several Halo specific event display screens for reporting event results and summaries.
For event import, the App uses the script-based Modular Input tool. The Modular Input script retrieves event data from a CloudPassage Halo account and imports it into Splunk Enterprise for further processing. 
Retrieving events. The script is designed to execute repeatedly, keeping Splunk up-to-date with Halo events as time passes and new events occur:
The first time the script runs, it by default retrieves all logged events within the past 90 days from a single Halo account. Then the script creates a file, writes the timestamp of the last-retrieved event in it, and saves it as a checkpoint. You may find the checkpoint file in /Splunk/var/lib/splunk/modinputs.
Every subsequent time the script runs, it retrieves only those events that were created after the timestamp stored in the checkpoint. 
During any script run, if no new events have occurred since the last run, no events are retrieved or imported into Splunk.
Output formats. The script receives event data from Halo in Halo's native JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, which you can view in Splunk after the data has been imported.
Authentication to the Halo API. CloudPassage Halo requires the Modular Input script to pass a valid Halo API key pair in order to obtain event data. You can find the Halo API key pair in CloudPassage Halo Portal. We recommend using an auditor (read-only) API key pair with the necessary server group scope.
Prerequisites
To get started, you must have the following:


An active CloudPassage Halo subscription. If you don't have one, Register for CloudPassage to receive your credentials and further instructions by email.


Access to your CloudPassage API key. Best practice is to create a new read-only key specifically for use with this script.


Splunk Enterprise Server 7.0 or later. You can download Splunk Enterprise Server from here.


A. Install the CloudPassage App
You can obtain the CloudPassage app through Splunkbase.
Get the App from Splunk Apps
To install the CloudPassage App for Splunk Enterprise, first log into Splunk Enterprise. After you have successfully logged in, click on the gear icon next to Apps on the top left of your screen then click on Browse more apps, this will take you to the Splunk Apps page. 

On the Splunk Apps page, search for “CloudPassage” to find the “CloudPassage App for Splunk Enterprise”. Click Install to install the app. 
Verify the Installation
Regardless of how you install the CloudPassage App, once you are successful it appears in the Splunk Enterprise dashboard, like this:

Create cloudpassage Index
All events will be written to an index named ""cloudpassage"". Make sure to create the index via the Splunk GUI before activating the CloudPassage App.

For Splunk Cloud:

For Splunk Enterprise:

The index name must be ""cloudpassage"", all other parameters is up to the user to decide. 
B. Configure and Activate the CloudPassage App
After installing the CloudPassage App, configure it by obtaining required Halo information, specifying the Modular Input configuration settings in a configuration file, and entering additional data input settings within Splunk Enterprise. Once you have done that, execution of the App is automatic.
Retrieve and save your CloudPassage API key
The Modular Input is a python script that makes calls to the CloudPassage API. The script is required to authenticate itself to Halo during every session; therefore, you (as a Halo user) need to make your CloudPassage API Key available to the script. 

To retrieve your CloudPassage API key, log into the CloudPassage Portal and navigate to Environment > Settings > Site Administration and click the API Keys tab. (If you haven’t generated an API key yet, do so by clicking Actions > New Api Key.)


If you do create an API key, we recommend that, as a best practice, you create a read-only key. A read-only key is all that you need to be able to retrieve Halo event data.


Retrieve both the Key ID and the Secret Key values for the API key. Click Show for your key on the API Keys tab to display both values.

Configure the App in Splunk
Now integrate your installed CloudPassage App into Splunk Enterprise.
Log into your Splunk Enterprise installation. Choose Data Inputs from the Settings menu. 

Click on CloudPassage Splunk Connector dialog box opens.

You add new types of data to Splunk Enterprise by telling it about them. There are a number of ways you can specify a data input, either in terms of its type or by its source. The Modular Input script is a source that collects data for Splunk by connecting to the CloudPassage Grid and using the Halo Event API. That is the source type that you will select.
Click on the Add new dialog box opens:

Fill in these fields:


Name: Enter a display name for your App, such as ""CloudPassage Halo"". This name appears on the App's data input summary page.
CloudPassage Halo API Key: Copy your saved Halo API key ID and paste it into this field.
CloudPassage Halo API Secret: Copy your saved Halo API key secret and paste it into this field.
Starting Date/Time: Optionally enter the starting date-time of events to be retrieved from your Halo account. Use ISO-8601 format; for example 2013-09-19T17:34:28.808886Z. All events newer than this date-time will be retrieved the first time the script runs; on each subsequent run, only events newer than the newest previously retrieved event will be retrieved.Putting a value in this field is optional; if you leave it blank, the first execution of the script will retrieve all defined events from your Halo account within 90 days prior. 
Please Note:  
If checkpoint exists, it will take precedence. You can find the checkpoint in /Splunk/var/lib/splunk/modinputs. 
CloudPassage Halo has a 90 days data retention period. 


API Hostname: By default this is set to api.cloudpassage.com. If your CloudPassage API hostname is different from the default setting, please specify here.
Proxy Host: Copy your proxy host ip address and paste it into this feild. (Optional)
Proxy Port: Copy your proxy port and paste it into this field. (Optional)
Set sourcetype. Choose ""Manual"".
Select source type from list. Select the source type value that you specified in the Splunk props.conf file (for example, [cp_halo]; see Set up props.conf).

Click Save.
When it has finished adding the new data source, Splunk displays a success message:
You're done! The Modular Input script is now running, automatically providing events to Splunk for indexing.
C. View Halo Events in Splunk
The CloudPassage App provides several interactive pages that allow you to view and manipulate your Halo data from many different perspectives. Once the script runs successfully and is incorporating event data into Splunk, you will see Halo events such as the following appear in your CloudPassage App within Splunk Enterprise.You're done!

Overview
Google GeoCode app is a way to translate your address fields into (latitude,longitude) and also reverse i.e. (latitude,longitude) into Address. Just use the command ""printgeocode"" in pipeline to your Splunk search command and convert your address to geolocation points or vice versa.
Version: 1.7.0
Infrastructure Requiment
Any Operating system (tested on Windows 7/10 and Linux)
Splunk 6.4, 6.5, 6.6
Installation

Install the app on your Splunk Search Head(s).
Get a google API key from Google API Key
Write the API_Key in the setup page.
Restart Splunk Search Head.

Usage
  your splunk query|printgeocode type=geocode address=Address_field
Geocoding returns three new fields: geolocation_status, geolocation_lat and geolocation_lon
OR 
   your splunk query|printgeocode type=reverse latfield=latfieldname lonfield=lonfieldname
Reverse Geocoding returns two new fields: geolocation_status and geolocation_addr
Where type=geocoding tells the app that it is geocoding and type=reverse indicates that it is Reverse Geocoding
Address_field is the name of the text field in your data which contains a valid address. latfieldname and lonfieldname are fields    containing values of latitude and longitudes of an geopoint respectively.
The output fields are prefixed with keyword geolocation.

Example-1 Geocoding: Address to latitude,longitude

    index=test sourcetype=""users_addresses"" 
    | head 2
    | table first_name last_name address city country Address 
    | printgeocode type=geocode address=Address


Use map with latitude,longitude from the output of the command

    index=test sourcetype=""users_addresses"" 
    | head 2
    | table first_name last_name address city country Address
    | printgeocode type=geocode address=Address
    | geostats count latfield=geolocation_lat longfield=geolocation_lon 


Example-2 Reverse Geocoding: latitude,longitude to Address

    index=test sourcetype=""user_latlon"" 
    | head 5
    | table policyID line county point_latitude point_longitude 
    | printgeocode type=reverse latfield=point_latitude lonfield=point_longitude 

As simple as looking for a location on Maps :)
Handling of API key
The Google API Key entered on the setup page is stored as password in encrypted format at Rest Endpoint path: 
 https://<SPLUNK_SEARCH_HEAD_URL>:8089/servicesNS/nobody/GoogleGeoCode/storage/passwords 

The password is retrieved, decrypted and then the API is invoked. It is stored at $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/GoogleGeoCode/local/passwords.conf
    [credential::Test Server Key:]
    password = $1$DLLZaK+SYHMnEAonrZi7vpuOEpJUXvi3cX3mV1fonSgdiiz3ZR2BHg==
Troubleshooting


The field geolocation_status is an indicator of the status from Google's Geolocation API. If everything is okay (input, quota of API key and Internet connection), the status will be ""OK"". Below are some of the status returned by Google's API-

""OK"" indicates that no errors occurred; the address was successfully parsed and at least one geocode was returned.
""ZERO_RESULTS"" indicates that the geocode was successful but returned no results. This may occur if the geocoder was passed a non-existent address.
""OVER_QUERY_LIMIT"" indicates that you are over your quota.
""REQUEST_DENIED"" indicates that your request was denied.
""INVALID_REQUEST"" generally indicates that the query (address, components or latlng) is missing.
""UNKNOWN_ERROR"" indicates that the request could not be processed due to a server error. The request may succeed if you try again.



If you get an error ""OVER_QUERY_LIMIT"", you can try below options -


Option1: Get a new Key and put that value in myconfig.py. Restart Splunk search head, the results should be good.


Option 2: Wait for midnight PST timezone for the limit to rest :)


When you run the command, the information is logged into $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/googlegeocode.log


    2018-05-02 14:10:35,167 INFO In Reverse Geocode function
    2018-05-02 14:10:37,578 INFO Status from Google GeoCoding API is OK

References
The app uses the Google's Geocoding API. Here's the link to their documentation
Geocoding is the process of converting addresses (like ""1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA"") into geographic coordinates (like latitude 37.423021 and longitude -122.083739), which you can use to place markers on a map, or position the map.
Reverse geocoding is the process of converting geographic coordinates into a human-readable address.
The Google Maps Geocoding API provides a direct way to access these services via an HTTP request. The following example uses the Geocoding service through the Google Maps JavaScript API to demonstrate the basic functionality.

OVERVIEW
The CloudKnox App for Splunk builds a dashboard from the data provided by CloudKnox Add-on for Splunk.

Author - CloudKnox, Inc.
Version - 1.1.0
Build - 45
Creates Index - False
Prerequisites - This application is dependent on version 1.1.0 of CloudKnox Add-on for Splunk (TA-CloudKnox)
Compatible with:
Splunk Enterprise version: 7.3.x and 8.0.x
CloudKnox API v2
OS: Platform independent
Browser: Safari, Chrome and Firefox



Release Notes Version 1.1.0

Added support for CloudKnox platform audit logs
Added support for CloudKnox alerts
Added alert that triggers when a new super identity is indexed in Splunk

Upgrade Steps
No special steps are required to upgrade the CloudKnox App for Splunk from version 1.0.0 to version 1.1.0.
RECOMMENDED SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

Standard Splunk configuration

TOPOLOGY AND SETTING UP SPLUNK ENVIRONMENT


This app has been distributed in two parts.

CloudKnox Add-on for Splunk, which collects data from CloudKnox using REST API calls.
CloudKnox App for Splunk, which adds dashboards to visualize the CloudKnox data



This app can be set up in two ways:

Standalone Mode:
Install the CloudKnox App for Splunk and CloudKnox Add-on for Splunk.
The CloudKnox App for Splunk uses the data collected by CloudKnox Add-on for Splunk and builds dashboards on it.


Distributed Environment:
Install the CloudKnox App for Splunk and CloudKnox Add-on for Splunk on the search head. User does not need to configure an account or create an input in CloudKnox Add-on for Splunk on search head.
Install only CloudKnox Add-on for Splunk on the heavy forwarder. User needs to configure account and needs to create data input to collect data from CloudKnox.
User needs to manually create an index on the indexer (No need to install CloudKnox App for Splunk or CloudKnox Add-on for Splunk on indexer).





INSTALLATION
CloudKnox App for Splunk can be installed through UI using ""Manage Apps"" > ""Install app from file"" or by extracting tarball directly into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ folder.
CONFIGURATION
Configure Macros:
Follow the below steps to configure the macros:

Go to ""Settings"" > ""Advanced search"" > ""Search macros"".
Select ""CloudKnox App for Splunk"" in ""App"" context dropdown.
Click on cloudknox(2) macro from the shown table.
In the macro definition default value will be index=""main"" sourcetype=""cloudknox:$authSystemtype$:$category$"". Update the definition with the index you used for data collection and save the configurations. For example: index=""<your_index_name>"" sourcetype=""cloudknox:$authSystemtype$:$category$"".
Search cloudknoxindex macro and repeat the above step. The user is required to configure this macro in order to user the ""cloudknox_super_identities_alert"".
Next search cloudknox_url_without_scheme macro and replace ""xyz.cloudknox.io"" with the URL of your CloudKnox instance. The user is required to configure this macro in order to use the drill-down functionality in the ""CloudKnox Alerts"" dashboard.

Note: If the user has selected a default index (Note: By default, Splunk considers only main index as default index) in ""Data Input"" configuration during CloudKnox Add-on for Splunk's configuration step, then no need to perform steps 3, 4 and 5.
Configure Savedsearches:
This App contains below 2 schedule searches:
 cloudknox_super_identities_snapshot: This savedsearch updates cloudknox_si_snapshot KV store lookup to contain the latest super identities.
 cloudknox_super_identities_alert: This alert is generated when any new super identity is added.
Configuring savedsearches is only required if the user wishes to use ""cloudknox_super_identities_alert"" which triggers an alert when a new super identity is indexed in Splunk. Follow the below steps to configure the savedsearches:

Navigate to Settings > Searches, reports, and alerts
Find ""cloudknox_super_identities_snapshot"" search
Click on Edit > Edit Schedule
Enable the search and optionally update the ""Schedule"" and ""Time Range"" as per the requirement.
Thereafter find the ""cloudknox_super_identities_alert"" alert
Click on Edit > Edit Alert
Optionally modify the ""Time Range"" and ""Cron Expression"" as per the requirement
Add appropriate action to perform when the alert is triggered
Click ""Save"" to update the settings and enable the alert

TROUBLESHOOTING

If you do not see any results in search then check whether you have correctly configured index in the cloudknox(2) macro. Also you can verify if the data is there in the index by running the search query index=""<your_index_name>"" source=""cloudknox"".

UNINSTALL & CLEANUP STEPS

Remove $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/CloudKnoxAppforSplunk
To reflect the cleanup changes in UI, restart Splunk instance. Refer https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.0.6/Admin/StartSplunk documentation to get information on how to restart Splunk.

Note: $SPLUNK_HOME denotes the path where Splunk is installed. Ex: /opt/splunk

A Splunk® add-on providing a modular input for cyclically retrieving submissions from your Bugcrowd programs, creating a Splunk event for each new or updated submission.
Created using the Splunk Add-On builder.
Cross-compatible with Python 2 and 3. Tested on Splunk Enterprise 7.3.5 and 8.0.2.1.
Licensed under http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.
Feel free to submit issues via https://github.com/hRun/TA-bugcrowd/issues.
Installation
Just unpack to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps and restart your Splunk instance. Appropriately choose between search heads, indexers and heavy forwarders in distributed environments.
Set python.version=python2 or python.version=python3 in inputs.conf if you would like to explicitly specify the Python version to use. Otherwise this will be determined by your instance's global settings.
Requirements
You'll need to provide a valid API key (HTTP Authorization Header token) to your Bugcrowd program(s) when setting up inputs.
Your Splunk instance requires access to the internet (via a proxy) to query https://api.bugcrowd.com.
Usage
Create a new Bugcrowd API input to cyclically retrieve new and/or updated submissions from each of your Bugcrowd programs.

Set Name as you please.
Set Interval to the intervals (in seconds) you wish the input to run in. Recommendation: Not less than 1800.
Set Index to the Splunk index you wish the retrieved data to end up in.
Set API Key to the API key (HTTP Authorization Header) of the Bugcrowd program you're creating the input for.
Set Starting From to the earliest submission state you wish submission data to be pulled from. Default is ""triaged"", which are submissions reviewed by Bugcrowd staff and purged of duplicates and non-applicable submissions. ""new"" will pull all new submissions reported to your program, including duplicates and non-applicable submissions. ""unresolved"" will only pull submissions already reviewed and accepted by your staff.
Set Track States to ""true"" (default) if you wish to create a new Splunk event as soon as the state of a submission changed on your Bugcrowd program (e.g. a submission is moved from ""triaged"" to ""unresolved""). Set to ""false"" if you only wish to create a single Splunk event per submission, when it is first seen.

Default sourcetype for pulled data is bugcrowd:json. Edit inputs.conf and props.conf if you prefer a different naming scheme.
Edit bugcrowd_submission eventtype and bugcrowd_data macro to your needs.
Disable the app's visibility via Manage>Apps or app.conf if you wish.
Set python.version=python2 or python.version=python3 in inputs.conf if you would like to explicitly specify the Python version to use. Otherwise this will be determined by your instance's global settings.
TODO / Known Issues


api.bugcrowd.com does currently not return the timestamps of submissions' state transitions (e.g. moving an ""unresolved"" submission to ""resolved""). Thus the add-on will set transition events' timestamps to the observed transition time, which is up to input interval seconds later than the actual state transition. This was reported to Bugcrowd, awaiting enhancement of the API to return the necessary information.


Add Bugcrowd logo/branding after consent.


Potentially add showcase dashboard.

IF YOU HAVE UPGRADED TO VERSION 2.2 OR ABOVE FROM VERSION 2.1 OR BELOW. PLEASE FOLLOW THE MANDATORY AND SIMPLE MIGRATION INSTRUCTIONS. SEE PARAGRAPH FURTHER DOWN.
These steps needs to be done in order. 
1. Get the data in. Use one of these sourcetype names ""access_common"", ""access_combined"", ""iis"", ""ms:iis:auto"", ""ms:iis:default"" ""apache:access"", ""oracle:weblogic"" or ""aws:cloudfront:accesslogs"".
2. Modify the eventtype called web-traffic so it points to the correct indexes for the web logs.
3. Configure the sites that you want to monitor.
4. Run ""Generate Session"" and ""Generate pages"" lookup searches.
5. Enable Data Model Acceleration for Web datamodel.
6. Configure goals (Optional)
1. Import web log data
The Splunk App for Web Analytics currently supports data from Apache, IIS, Oracle Weblogic and AWS Cloudfront logs. Make sure you use the sourcetypes access_common, access_combined, iis, apache:access oracle:weblogic or aws:cloudfront:accesslogs for this data. If you already have data in Splunk under a different sourcetype you can use sourcetype renaming or by modifying the eventtype web-traffic to include the names of your sourcetypes.
If you plan on using the sourcetype apache:access, you need to install the prerequisite Add-on as this app builds on top of the base field extractions from the Add-on for Apache:
https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3186/
If you plan on using the sourcetypes ms:iis:auto or ms:iis:default, you need to install the prerequisite Add-on as this app builds on top of the base field extractions from the Splunk Add-on for IIS:
https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3185/
If you plan on using the sourcetype aws:cloudfront:accesslogs, you need to install the prerequisite Add-on as this app builds on top of the base field extractions from the Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services:
https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876/
The app comes with three sets of sample data for Apache, IIS and IIS in the w3c format, ms:iis:default. You can enable these static sample inputs by going into  Settings->Data inputs->Files & Directories
Modify the eventtype called web-traffic so it points to the correct indexes for the web logs.
2. Configure websites
The Splunk App for Web Analytics works in a multi website environment. Websites are configured from a combination of the host and the source field. Each event with that unique combination will be tagged with the corresponding website name in the field ""site"". You can use wildcards (*) in the Source and Host field to select multiple files matching a pattern. There is a website setup form page that allows you to add these in an easy way.
Here are some examples of valid website configurations with or without wildcards
No wildcards
Site            Host    Source
roadrunner.com  server1 /var/log/httpd/access_log
roadrunner.com  server2 /var/log/httpd/access_log
With wildcards
Site            Host    Source
roadrunner.com  server /var/log/httpd/access_
The data in the setup form will be stored in the lookup called WA_settings. You can also manually edit this lookup. The websites setup page can be found under Setup->Websites.
3. Run lookups
Once the data has been imported run the two lookups ""Generate user sessions"" and ""Generate pages"". These will be used throughout the app. Once run the first time, they will automatically be updated via two scheduled searches that runs every 10 minutes that adds any new data coming into the app. Running these lookup searches might take a long time depending on how much data you have in Splunk but its important you let the searches finish before you move on to the next step. If you have too much data to run these for everything you can modify the time period to something less than ""All time"" which is the default time period. The lookup reports can be found under Setup->Lookups or by using the links above. It's important that thes searches return results. If not, the app will not work.
4. Choose data model and enable data model acceleration
The Splunk App for Web Analytics uses data model acceleration extensively to power the dashboards. The app allows you to select the datamodel name you want to use. By default the app uses the datamodel ""Web"". I you have a naming conflict for this datamodel (there is a Web data model alread in the CIM app which is slightly different to this one), you can choose to rename it. See additional instructions below for using a custom datamodel name.
Once the lookups in the previous step has completed you should enable acceleration for the data model ""Web"" (or the custom name you have chosen). The data model can be found under Settings->Data models. Set the summary range appropriately depending on how long you want to keep the data, > 1 Month. The data model is updated every 10 minutes in order for the sessions to get picked up properly. The data model acceleration needs to finish before you will see any data in any dashboard except the ""Real-Time"" dashboard which uses raw log data as source. That means that you initially might not see data until the data model has finished building. This could initially take many hours depending on how much data it is trying to build.
If Events are showing 0 after install or upgrade you might have to rebuild the data model.
Using a custom datamodel name

Go to the Settings->Data models page and click Edit->Clone for the datamodel Web inside the SplunkAppForWebAnalytics app.
Give the datamodel a new name, set the same name for the title and the ID fields, i.e. ""WebAnalytics"". Make sure you also set the Permissions to Clone.
Update the settings macro that defines the datamodel name. Use the same name as in the previous step, i.e. ""WebAnalytics"" or similar. You can find the macro here.

5. Configure goals (Optional)
If you want to monitor certain browsing paths or pageviews you can configure goals. This is used if you for instance want to get conversion rates or funnel abandonment rates. You can find the Goals setup page under Goals->Goals Setup.
The goals are stored in a summary index called ""goal_summary"".
When enabling goals, the app will start monitor goal completions from the time you save the goal. To backfill goals there is a search called ""Generate Goal summary - Backfill"" which can be found under the Goals menu. Please note that running this search multiple times will mean the goal completions will be duplicated. To reset the goals you need to clean the ""goal_summary"" index.
Upgrade instructions

Install app - Select ""Upgrade App"" checkbox.
Depending on which version of the app you are upgrading from you might need to rebuild the data model. See below. 

Data model rebuild instructions

Disable Data Model acceleration for data model ""Web"".
Run the ""Generate user sessions"" search.
Once the session generation search is complete. Re-enable data model acceleration on  the Data Models configuration page.
Expand data model ""Web"" by clicking on the arrow on the left hand side. Click ""Rebuild"".

Updating the User Agent parsing library
The app uses a third party user agent parsing library that gets updated regularly. If you want to manually update these definitions you can download a yaml file here:
https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core/blob/master/regexes.yaml
Copy the file ""regexes.yaml"" the folder 
SplunkAppForWebAnalytics/bin/ua_parser 
This update should take affect immediately.
Considerations for upgrading from v2.1.0 to v2.2.0 and above
THIS VERSION CONTAINS A BREAKING CHANGE. SEE BELOW.
From version 2.2.0, the app now uses the KV store to store the wesite configuration (collection WA_settings). This makes it a lot easier to edit and setup the website configuration step. This is something that many users have struggled with so I hope this change will make it easier during the initial setup.
If you are upgrading from an old version you need to take the mandatory step of migrating the old configuration from in the csv lookup to the KV store. This is done by going to the webite setup page and clicking the ""Migrate old config"" button. You only need to do this once.
Considerations for upgrading from v1.x to v2.0.0
Version 2.0.0 of the app has made a small change to the Web datamodel to increase compatibility with more Splunk versions. This might trigger a data model rebuild when upgrading. If you want to prevent this from happening, use the old data model definition file ""web.conf"" and delete the one provided wby this app. It's recommended to use the new version of web.conf as this is the version that will be used moving forwards.
The User Journey Flow dashboard now uses the official Sankey vizualisation add-on that needs to be downloaded separately in order for this dashboard to work. You can find this add-on here: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3112/
The goal_summary index is now not created by the app. You need to manually add this index if you are using this feature in the app. All old data will be retained even if the index is not created by the app, just create the index manually and it will work.
There is a new dashboard, ""Response Times"" which help you find the slowest resources on your site. Your web server might not output the response time in the log by default so this needs to be enabled in order to make this dashboard work. On IIS this is often pre-enabled but on Apache and NGINX you need to add %D to the end of the log format settings of the server. More details on how to enabled this here: 
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_log_config.html
If you add the %D to the end of the log format for the access_combined sourcetype, the field extractions will work by default.
Considerations for upgrading from v1.6 to v1.5
Version 1.6 of the app uses the KV Store for the session lookups instead of a CSV file. This feature will only work on Splunk version 6.3 and above.
For 6.2 support of the app, you need to continue using a CSV file for the lookup.
To enable this you should replace the contents of, or the file:
""SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SplunkAppForWebAnalytics/default/transforms.conf"" 
with the corresponding 6.2 compatible file that can be found under 
""SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SplunkAppForWebAnalytics/install/transforms_6.2.conf"".
Restart Splunk after this is done. 
Troubleshooting
Use the Splunk Community
Splunk Answers thread on Splunk App for Web Analytics.
https://answers.splunk.com/app/questions/2699.html
A lot of the problems customers have with the app have already been solved.
The lookup searches are not returning any data
In the context of the app, try and do the search for:
tag=web
Based on the output of this search check the following


No data returned
If this is not returning any results I suspect you are not seeing the data because it is stored in a non-default index and the user in Splunk does not search in non-default indexes automatically. Another issue might be that you are not using any of the pre-configured sourcetypes. See Setup point 1 above.


Site field not present
If this is returning results, double check that each entry has the ""site"" field populated. It's crucial that this field exists in your data. See Setup point 2 above.


File field not present
Another field that is known to cause problems is the ""file"" field. This needs to be present in your field extractions and if it is not, you will not see the ""eventtype-=pageview"" which is necessary for the app to work. Make sure this is extracted correctly. 


All or some dashboards are returning ""No results found""
As the app relies heavily on data model accelerations you will not see anything in any dashboards (except the ""Real-Time"" ones) until this acceleration has completed. Initially this could take a while. There is a ""Data Model Audit"" dashboard that will tell you if the acceleration is complete or not.

Uninstallation of App
This section provides the steps to uninstall App from a standalone Splunk platform installation.


(Optional) If you want to remove data from Splunk database, you can use the below Splunk CLI clean command to remove indexed data from an app before deleting the app.

$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk clean eventdata -index <index_name>



Delete the app and its directory. The app and its directory are typically located in the folder$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/<appname> or run the following command in the CLI:

$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk remove app [appname] -auth <splunk username>:<splunk password>



You may need to remove user-specific directories created for your app by deleting any files found here: $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/etc/users/*/<appname>


Restart the Splunk platform.You can navigate to Settings -> Server controls and click the restart button in splunk web UI or use the following splunk CLI command to restart splunk:

$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk restart



Configuration of Add-on

After installation, Go to the Apps->Manage Apps and open ""Setup"" screen for Cisco NAE Add-on for Splunk Enterprise.

It will open a  set up screen which will ask for NAE credentials.


The app provides 2 different modes to collect the data in Splunk. The common fields are NAE Hostname or IP address, Username and Collect Epochs from last n hours.

Mention total no. of hours to go back and fetch data from NAE (Default is set to '4' hours) in Collect Epochs from last n hours field.

The different modes are:


Local User Authentication


The user can configure the app using default approach i.e. using Password.


To setup NAE with Local User Authentication, follow below given steps.

On the setup screen, enable ""Local User Authentication"" checkbox.
Enter NAE hostname or IP address.
Enter hours to go back and collect epoch.
Enter username and password which is used to login to the NAE.
Click on Save button at the bottom of the page.



Remote User Authentication


The user needs to provide both Password and Domain Name of User specified.


To setup NAE with Remote User Authentication, follow below given steps.

On the setup screen, enable ""Remote User Authentication"" checkbox.
Enter NAE hostname or IP address.
Enter hours to go back and collect epoch.
Enter username and password which is used to login to the NAE.
Enter domain name of user.
Click on Save button at the bottom of the page.

SSL Configuration:

By Default SSL Verification is Enabled
To Disable SSL Verification follow below steps:
After successfully configuring through setup page, passwords.conf file will be created under TA_cisco-candid/local folder
It will contain stanza like: [credential:<nae_host>:<username>,<True>,<epoch_hour>:]
Change True to False to disable SSL Verification
Restart Splunk





Enable the collector script: Go to Settings> Data Inputs>Scripts, enable the script '$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA_cisco-candid/bin/collectCandid.py -candid'
   The time interval for the script is 900 seconds by default.


NAE Hostname or IP address once configured to any 2 modes of authentication, cannot be configured through the remaining mode of authentication.


Also, user can setup NAE either using any one of the two modes of authentication or all the two modes one by one but for different NAEs.


Example: User can either setup only NAE1 using Local/Remote User Authentication.
                          OR
  User can setup NAE1 for Local User Authentication, NAE2 for Remote User Authentication.


Whenever user wants to change the credentials, he/she needs to remove the current entry from directory TA_cisco-candid/local/passwords.conf first.
   Restart the Splunk. Provide the credentials through UI.


User also needs to modify ""default/inputs.conf"" according to the following guidelines.


inputs.conf
This file contains filename paths which are different based on your OS platform.
The app is configured out of the box to work for Unix/Linux/MacOS systems.
If you are running this app on a Windows system, perform the following steps:
  Copy the file ""default/inputs.conf.WINDOWS"" to ""local/inputs.conf""

The entry in default/input.conf contains a field ""passAuth"" with default value admin. This field can contain any splunk user with admin rights.

Create your own index:

The app data defaults to 'main' index.
If you need to specify a particular index for your NAE data, for ex. ""candid"",create an indexes.conf file [sample shown in ($SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA_cisco-candid/default/indexes.conf.sample)]
Once you specify your index, edit the inputs.conf file and add a line ""index=[yourindex]"" under each script stanza.
Note: The Splunk user needs to be able to search the defined index. You can do so by editing the user role and adding the defined index to be searched by default.

TEST YOUR INSTALL


Once  Add-on app  is configured to receive data from CNAE, The main app dashboard can take some time before the data is populated in all panels. A good test to see that you are receiving all of the data is to run this search after several minutes:
index=""<your index>"" | stats count by sourcetype


In particular, you should see the sourcetype:
* cisco:candid:events
If you don't see these sourcetypes, have a look at the messages output by the scripted input: collectiCandid.py. Here is a sample search that will show them:
index=_internal component=""ExecProcessor"" collectCandid.py ""CNAE Error:"" | table _time host log_level message
Data Generator

This app is provided with sample data which can be used to generate dummy data. To simulate this sample data, the Splunk Event generator, which is available at https://github.com/splunk/eventgen, needs to be installed at $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps. This APP uses the Samples provided in NAE Add-on app to populate the dummy data for NAE environment

Fidelis Cybersecurity Add-on for Splunk will listen for Syslog messages from Fidelis Cybersecurity on specific port and index it into Splunk.
REQUIREMENTS

Splunk version >= 6.3
If using a forwarder, it must be a HEAVY forwarder( we use the HF because the universal forwarder does not include python)
The forwarder system must have network access (HTTP/HTTPS) to Fidelis Cybersecurity Command post which is to be Splunked.
Fidelis user ID, password, Command Post URL and Command Post Port Number for collecting data from Fidelis Cybersecurity Commandpost.

Recommended System configuration

Splunk forwarder system should have 4 GB of RAM and a quad-core CPU to run this app smoothly.

Topology and Setting up Splunk Environment

This app has been distributed in two parts.

1) Add-on app, which listens for Syslog messages from Fidelis Cybersecurity.
  2) Main app for visualizing Fidelis Cybersecurity data.


This App can be set up in two ways:
  1) Standalone Mode: Install main app and Add-on app.

Here both the app resides on a single machine.
Main app uses the data collected by Add-on app and builds dashboard on it



2) Distributed Environment: Install the main app and Add-on app on search head. Add-on app on forwarder and Indexer.
 * Configure Add-on app on forwarder.
 * Main app on search head uses the received data and builds dashboards on it.

Installation in Splunk Cloud

In Splunk cloud we recommend, install Add-on app on internal premises forwarder, Splunk cloud indexer, and Splunk cloud search head. But configure only on internal premises forwarder.

Installation of App

This app can be installed through UI using ""Manage Apps"" or extract zip file directly into /opt/splunk/etc/apps/ folder.

Configuration of App


If you are using index different than ""main"", please change the index name into inputs.conf and macros.conf files. By default the app will ingest data into main index


After installation, go to the Apps->Manage Apps->Set up Technology Add-on for Fidelis Cybersecurity. New setup screen will open which will ask for Fidelis Cybersecurity Command post details. Provide Port to listen for Fidelis Alert traffic, Protocol, Command Post URL, Command Post Port Number, User Name and password for Fidelis Cybersecurity Command post and save them.

Splunk REST API will encrypt the password and store it in Add-on's folder itself in encrypted form, REST modular script will fetch these credentials through REST API to connect to the Fidelis Cybersecurity Commandpost.
Restart the Splunk

Upgrade App

Follow standard steps to upgrade the app.
The setup form in the new version of the app has an option called ""Enable Data Inputs"" which is checked by default. If user is upgrading from the previous version and wants to use same Data Inputs, this checkbox should be explicitly unchecked.

CIM Compatibility
This app is compatible with CIM 4.x >=
Support

Email support will be provided as best effort.

TEST YOUR INSTALL
The main app dashboard can take some time before the data is returned which will populate some of the panels. A good test to see that you are receiving all of the data we expect is to run this search after several minutes:
search `fidelis_get_xps_event` | stats count by sourcetype

In particular, you should see these sourcetypes:
 fidelis:xps
 fidelis:xps:api
If you don't see these sourcetypes, have a look at the log file $SPLUNK_HOME$/var/log/TA-Fidelis-Analytics/fidelis.log.",Version 1.2.5,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/78e076ea-7dc5-11e7-865b-02f13bdc2585.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,542,0,splunk,5,2,Fidelis CyberSecurity,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/Fidelis_CyberSecurity,"Products: Splunk Enterprise

Overview Video
The Splunk App for Hyperledger Fabric contains a set of dashboards and analytics to give you full visibility into the system metrics, application data and ledger so that you can maintain security, stability and performance for your Hyperledger Fabric deployment.  
These dashboards are meant to be a starting point for building analytics around your environment whether your infrastructure is virtual or physical, on-premise or in the cloud.
In order to take full advantage of the dashboards provided there are 4 types of data sources that should be configured.

Hyperledger Fabric Distributed Ledger - These logs contain transaction information from the ledger itself and provide insight into operations and actions on-chain. We’ve open sourced our Splunk Connect for Hyperledger Fabric to help you easily ingest Hyperledger Fabric ledgers in Splunk.
Hyperledger Fabric Application Logs - Application logs provide information about specific Hyperledger components such as the Orderers, Peer Nodes and other services (CouchDB and Kafka) useful for troubleshooting, debugging and monitoring application performance.
Hyperledger Fabric Metrics (v1.4 and above) - These are metrics specific to Hyperledger Fabric components and performance. You can find a reference on these metrics here. 
Infrastructure/System Level Metrics and Logs - System metrics such as CPU, MEM, DISK and NETWORK activity provide insight into the underlying infrastructure Hyperledger Fabric nodes are running on.  These metrics/logs could come from physical machines, Docker, Kubernetes, IBM IKS, Microsoft Azure, Google’s GCP and AWS Cloudwatch to name a few.  Splunk has different Add-ons and connectors for each.  

App Features
Dashboards
There are a few dashboards provided to get you started with analyzing your Hyperledger Fabric deployment. These include:

Data Setup - A dashboard to ensure that your Splunk environment is receiving all the data the application requires.
Network Architecture and Channels - See at a glance the number of orderers, peers, and channels in your Hyperledger Fabric network.
Infrastructure Health and Monitoring - An overview of system health from system metrics like CPU, uptime status as well as transaction latency. You can see in real time when transactions are starting to back up or a peer is falling behind on blocks.
Transaction Analytics - Real time visibility into the transactions being written on each ledger. In this dashboard, we’re blending ledger data sent from the peers with logs and metrics to give a holistic view of the network’s health.




Field Extractions and Aliases
The app provides a number of field extractions and aliases that will make searching and investigating Hyperledger Fabric data easier. These include parsing couchdb logs for actions (GET, PUT, POST, etc) and documents, chaincode logs for channel and latency metadata, and field aliases for accessing various parts of ledger transactions. To see the full list you can look at the props.conf file or go to Settings > Fields in Splunk.
Getting Started

Install the App on a Splunk Enterprise Search Head that will have access to the data.  
Open the App and navigate to the “Data Setup” dashboard from the Introduction Page.

Follow the instructions for each of the 4 data sources on the “Data Setup” page in order to populate the graphs and validate data is coming in correctly.

Hyperledger Fabric Ledger Logs - The Splunk Connect for Hyperledger Fabric is an open source agent that connects to a peer on the Hyperledger Fabric network. See the README on Github here for deployment instructions. Docker, Kubernetes, and native deployments are all options.
Hyperledger Fabric Application Logs - There are several options to get data in from you Hyperledger Fabric environment depending on where and how the nodes are hosted.  You will need to create an index in Splunk as well as an input mechanism to receive the data.  We usually like to create an index called “hyperledger_logs” and “hyperledger_metrics” and enable the Splunk HEC to receive data.  You can use the example “indexes.conf.example” provided in the app.  Simply rename the file from “indexes.conf.example” to “indexes.conf” to enable the indexes, and rename “inputs.conf.example” to “inputs.conf” to enable the HEC endpoints. You will also need to enable the HTTP Event Collector (HEC) to receive data if it has not been ""enabled"" already.



    $ cd $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/splunk-hyperledger-fabric/default
    $ sudo mv inputs.conf.example inputs.conf
    $ sudo mv indexes.conf.example indexes.conf
    $ cd /opt/splunk/bin
    $ sudo ./splunk restart
Supported Log Ingestion Methods

Docker: Splunk Docker Logging Driver
Kubernetes: Splunk Connect for Kubernetes

IBM Cloud Platform: IBM Cloud Platform
Microsoft Azure: Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services
AWS Cloudwatch: Splunk App for AWS
GCP Stackdriver: Splunk Add-on for Google Cloud

Also make sure to set the following environment variable in your Hyperledger Fabric environments:
    FABRIC_LOGGING_FORMAT=json
Hyperledger Fabric Metrics (v1.4 and above)
Hyperledger Fabric 1.4 exposes metrics for ingestion using StatsD. You can setup Splunk to ingest from StatsD.

Create a UDP data input following these directions OR use the example “inputs.conf.example” provided in the app.  Simple rename the file from “inputs.conf.example” to “inputs.conf” and restart Splunk.
Now set the following environment variables in your Hyperledger Fabric environment.

      CORE_METRICS_PROVIDER: statsd
      CORE_METRICS_STATSD_NETWORK: udp
      CORE_METRICS_STATSD_ADDRESS: [SPLUNK-HOST]:[PORT]
      ORDERER_METRICS_PROVIDER: statsd
      ORDERER_METRICS_STATSD_NETWORK: udp
      ORDERER_METRICS_STATSD_ADDRESS: [SPLUNK-HOST]:[PORT]


Open the Metrics Workspace to explore and analyze your metrics.


System Logs/Metrics - Depending on how you’ve deployed your Hyperledger Fabric network, there is probably a great option to get your System Logs and Metrics for end-to-end visibility. On the data setup dashboard, we’ve provided a list of common options that you can use to get your data into Splunk.

Splunk Enterprise 7.0 or later.
This app is designed to ingest SAP Solman data into Splunk metrics index (added in Splunk 7.0).
Splunk ITSI 4.0.1.
System Landscape Requirements for SAP Solution Manager were described on Monitor Systems - SAP Help Portal.

SAP and Splunk Prerequisites
Before deploying the app, you must ensure the following:


You have activated the required OData Service AI_SYSMON_OVERVIEW_SRV and SAPUI5 application service SM_TM_SYSMON according to App Implementation: Monitor Systems - SAP Help Portal.


Authorization settings are required to be set in SAP Solution Manager and to fetch data using relevant OData service. Authorizations were described in Security Guide for SAP Fiori Apps – SAP Solution Manager 7.2 SPS8 System Monitoring - SAP Help Portal.


Configuration System monitoring SAP landscape and custom metrics were described on System Monitoring 7.2 - Setup and Configuration - SCN Wiki.


Add-on requires Splunk kvstore to be operational on the instance that it is deployed on. Make sure that it is not disabled.


Add-on is designed to store obtained data within metrics index. Create a metrics index on your indexer(s) (for example called solman_metrics).


In distributed deployment option (see option 2 below), on ITSI environment, create a user that has the capabilities to create ITSI service via REST interface.


Installation
There are two options for add-on deployment: standalone ITSI server and distributed option.
Versions 1.0.0 and 1.1.0 support only the first option.
Versions 1.2.0 and above support both.
In standalone ITSI option, the add-on is installed on the same Splunk instance that also has ITSI REST interface.
Here the ITSI Splunk instance must have direct network connectivity to SAP OData interface (be within organization's security perimeter).
The first option does not work well for ITSI in Splunk Cloud or other distributed environment when ITSI instance can not or should not access SAP instances directly.
In that case, install the add-on on Splunk Heavy Forwarder that is close to SAP instances.
It will forward all collected data to the Splunk indexers and create corresponding ITSI services using ITSI REST interface.
Install the technology add-on on either ITSI instance (option 1) or on Splunk Heavy Forwarder (option 2):


Log in to Splunk and go to Apps > Manage Apps.


Click install app from file.


Upload the app package file and click upload.


Upgrading
Upgrading from v1.2.0 to v1.3.0
Version 1.3.0 introduced initial setup page. In order to let the v1.3.0 app understand that the application has been previously configured, edit $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/sap_solman_app/local/app.conf adding the following stanza:
[install]
is_configured = 1
Starting with v1.3.0, the modular input instance has to be named as ""main_input"". Edit $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/sap_solman_app/local/inputs.conf so that the stanza is called:
[sap_solman_mi://main_input]
...
After these configuration preparations, proceed with application upgrade. This can be done using UI.
Once the upgrade is done, please wait for several hours to let the application learn the actual metric update intervals. This should help eliminating gray N/A values that could be present in pre-1.3 versions of the app for the metrics that are rarely updated. The more you wait, the more precise the update intervals become.
In order to apply the new threshold level logic, after upgrade, navigate to Solman Configuration Dashboard and perform the following:

Click Disable all button and hit Save
Enable back the relevant metrics and hit Save

This will enforce new threshold rules and update period intervals.
Configuration


After installing the application, perform the initial setup

Go to the Manage Apps page and click Set up




Enter the Solman URL, user, and password. In case of standalone deployment option, do not enter ITSI REST-related fields. In case of distributed deployment, enter ITSI REST URL, user, and password. The recommended update interval is 300 seconds (5 minutes), this may be set to a higher value to reduce the load on Solman server. Choose the metrics index that has to be used for data ingestion.



Check use new server version if you want to use new Odata client(Right now, this version is experimental).




Configure the metrics to be collected. On the first invocation, modular input populates solman_metrics key-value store collection discovering all the systems and metrics available on SAP Solman. On the host having the add-on deployed, go to Solman Configuration Dashboard. Click on the button corresponding to the SAP system to be configured. Click on the sliders to enable or disable metrics collection. Once done, click on green Save button. Please wait for the Solman data to refresh before it gets into Splunk index (may take several minutes).



Navigate to ITSI Service Analyzer dashboard. You will see the data from the configured system



Troubleshooting
Use the troubleshooting dashboard within the app.

By default, app logging level is set to WARN.
To increase logging verbosity, edit $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/sap_solman_app/local/log.conf adding the following stanzas:
[default]
log_level = DEBUG

[splunklib.modularinput.script]
log_level = DEBUG

[sap_solman_mi]
log_level = DEBUG
If still in trouble, ask a question on Splunk Answers and email Operational_Intelligence_Support@epam.com.

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1858,2022-01-10,07:26:46 AM,Hurricane Labs Add-On for Unified2,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/screenshots/bdfc5036-7ad4-11eb-8b46-0264fd5fe923.png,"Oct. 19, 2014","What is it?

The Hurricane Labs Add-On for Unified2 is a Splunk Technology Add-On by
  Hurricane Labs for parsing data stored by Snort or Suricata in the Unified2
  binary format into a Splunk-compatible JSON format. This optionally includes
  packet capture data.
This TA is compatible with the ""Intrusion Detection"" data model in the Common
  Information Model. Its data will populate the Intrustion section in Splunk
  Enterprise Security as well as other CIM compliant Intrusion Detection apps,
  such as the future Hurricane Labs App for Intrusion Detection.
Installation

This TA should be installed into a forwarder on the Snort/Suricata host (this
  can be a Universal, Lightweight or Heavy Forwarder), and the first Splunk
  Enterprise system in the receiving chain (the same host if using a LWF or HF,
  another Heavy Forwarder, or your Indexer - check outputs.conf). There is no
  search head component to this app.
The only required configuration, beyond installation, is done on the
  Snort/Suricata host (referred to as 'the forwarder'). The configuration
  options can be seen in the unified2.conf file inside default in this app.
  There are two sections to this config: output and unified2.
The output section contains configuration for the output of the TA.
 o pretty - enables a more human readable output that may use more of your
   Splunk license. It is disabled by default
 o pcap - enables capture and indexing of packet data. This is enabled by
   default.

The unified2 section contains configuration related to your Snort/Suricata
  installation. If you have used Barnyard2 and/or PulledPork, you may be
  familiar with some of these files.
 o checkpoint_file - this file is used to track the events that have already
   been indexed. This file can be stored anywhere, and defaults to
   /var/log/snort/alert_json.checkpoint
 o input_u2 - Base filename of the Unified2 file written by Snort/Suricata.
   For snort, this is often /var/log/snort/snort.u2 to which Snort then
   appends a timestamp. This setting should NOT have the timestamp
 o sid_msg_map - This is the same as the sid_file config option in
   Barnyard2, and is generated by Pulledpork
 o gen_msg_map - This is the same as the gen_file config option in
   Barnyard2, and is generated by Pulledpork
 o classifications - This is the same as the classification_file config
   option in Barnyard2, and is generated by Pulledpork

Once these settings are configured (which can be done in local/unified2.conf
  to avoid future updates from overwriting your settings), you can then enable
  the scripted input (in local/inputs.conf) by duplicating the section header
  and then setting disabled = 0. You can also adjust the interval (default is
  30 seconds), the sourcetype (not recommended), or set an index (default is
  main).
After enabling the scripted input, you will need to restart Splunk. The
  default behavior, which is not configurable at this time, is to ignore any
  alerts in the Unified2 file if the checkpoint file does not exist. That is,
  the TA will not index any events that occurred BEFORE it was installed.
  After the first run of the script, the checkpoint file will be generated, and
  any future alerts will then be indexed.

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5518,2022-01-10,07:26:47 AM,Microsoft Defender Advanced Hunting Add-on for Splunk,,"Jan. 5, 2022","Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Advanced Hunting Add-on for Splunk
Introduction
This add-on provides field extractions and CIM compatibility for the Endpoint datamodel for Microsoft Defender Advanced Hunting data. 
It also maps Device Alert events to the Alerts datamodel. 
The data is similar in content to Sysmon data and can be used by Detection Searches in i.e. Splunk Enterprise Security Content Update.   
Future versions may include support for Microsoft Defender for Office 365, Microsoft Defender for Identity and other products in the Microsoft 365 suite.
How is this different from other Microsoft Defender Add-ons for Splunk?
Microsoft 365 Defender Add-on for Splunk

The above uses REST API to get data, and the REST API is rate limited, whereas this TA uses Event Hub
The above will only give you Alerts and Incidents, not the raw logs
The above maps to the Alerts CIM data model, not the Endpoint CIM data model

My advice: Use both Microsoft Defender Advanced Hunting Add-on and Microsoft 365 Defender Add-on for Splunk, in order to get both alerts and the raw logs!
TA for Defender ATP hunting API

The above uses REST API to pull similar data at intervals, and the REST API is rate limited
The above is not CIM compliant

My advice: You should not need this TA if you are using Microsoft Defender Advanced Hunting Add-on for Splunk.
Installation

Configure Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to stream Advanced Hunting events to an Azure Event Hub:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/raw-data-export-event-hub?view=o365-worldwide

Use a separate Event Hub Name for Advanced Hunting data. Don't mix this data with other types of data. Failing to do so will render this Add-on useless


Install this add-on on your Search Heads, Indexers and Heavy Forwarders (if part of your data collection topology)


Install and use this Splunk add-on to ingest the data:


Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/) version 4.3.3+


When setting the up the input, enter:


Sourcetype: mscs:azure:eventhub:defender:advancedhunting


Enable the scheduled saved search Summary - Defender Advanced Hunting Malware Summary on one Search Head (preferably ES) in order to populate the Malware data model.


Verify that raw data is arriving by running the following search: index=* eventtype=""ms_defender_advanced_hunting_sourcetypes""


Verify that data for the Malware data model is populated by the scheduled saved search by running the following search: index* sourcetype=defender:advancedhunting:malware

Add-on Homepage: https://apps.splunk.com/apps/id/TA-ms_cloud_app_security
Author: Hurricane Labs
Version: 1.0.0

Description
The purpose of this add-on is to provide value to your Microsoft Cloud App Security syslog from Alerts and Activities. This is done by making the logs CIM compliant, adding tagging for Enterprise Security data models, and other knowledge objects to make searching and visualizing this data easy.
This add-on assumes you are onboarding the data either using a syslog collector that outputs to a file or using the built-in Splunk TCP/UDP listener (I would highly recommend the former)--the knowledge objects will work for any ingestion method if you use the correct sourcetype. Regardless of ingestion method, you may need to adjust some of the props.conf settings for proper line breaking and timestamp parsing.

Built for Splunk Enterprise 6.x.x or higher
CIM Compliant (CIM 4.0.0 or higher)
Ready for Enterprise Security

Constraints

This add-on requires that you use the sourcetype ""ms:cas:syslog"" when ingesting the data.
This add-on must be installed on your parsing (HF/IDX) tier and Search Head(s).
This add-on requires that you choose ""Generic CEF"" as the Format when configuring CAS.

Microsoft Cloud App Security Instructions

Follow the steps as outlined by Microsoft here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/siem



SPLUNK INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

Search Head: Add-on Always Required (Knowledge Objects)
Heavy Forwarder: Add-on Possibly Required (Event Parsing)
Indexer: Add-on Possibly Required (Event Parsing)
SH & Indexer Clustering: Supported

Add-on Installation Instructions

This add-on needs to be installed on your Search Head(s) and on the FIRST Splunk Enterprise system(s) that handles the data, traditionally that would be a Heavy Forwarder or an Indexer. This add-on should not be deployed to a Universal Forwarder as it won't do anything.
Make sure you have read and understood the ""Constraints"" section to properly configure your inputs.conf.


A Splunk Restart may be required, you may also attempt a debug refresh.
Verify data is coming in and you are seeing the proper field extractions & sourcetype transforms by searching the data.
Example Search: index=cas sourcetype=ms:cas:*
Note: If you see 'ms:cas:syslog' as a sourcetype, the sourcetype transform isn't working. This likely means you did not install the TA according to step 1 above.


(Optional, recommended) On your Search Head(s) edit the ""ms_cas_alerts"" Event Type to include the index you're storing this sourcetype in.

Example Inputs.conf
How you choose to bring the syslog data into Splunk is completely up to you. Here are a couple examples of how you might bring on this data:
Built-in Splunk Listener Example
[tcp://9514]
connection_host = dns
sourcetype = ms:cas:syslog
index = cas
File Monitor For Syslog-ng Output Example
[monitor:///var/log/network/ms_cloud_app_security/*/syslog.log]
sourcetype = ms:cas:syslog
index = cas
disabled = 0
host_segment = 5

INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
Hardware and software requirements
Hardware requirements
Savvius for Splunk supports the following server platforms in the versions supported by Splunk Enterprise:

Windows (requires TA-savvius-win)
Linux (requires TA-savvius-nix)

Installation steps
Important: These instructions are for the TA only. To view the data, download the Savvius for Splunk Network Dashboards for the Splunk Server at https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2730
Installation Instructions
TA-Savvius-win

Download the Splunk Forwarder (http://www.splunk.com/download/universalforwarder)
Run the Splunk Forwarder installer, which will also walk you through the configuration
Download the ta-savvius-win_VER.tgz file from Splunkbase
Put the file into a folder like C:\install
Install the app from the cmd line:
       C:>""\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\bin\splunk.exe"" install app c:\install\ta-savvius-win_VER.tgz
Restart the Splunk forwarder:
         C:>""\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\bin\splunk.exe"" restart
To test: 
         C:>""\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\bin\splunk.exe"" list forward-server

How to configure receiving on the Splunk Server

From the Splunk UI goto Settings->Forwarding and receiving
Select “Configure receiving”
Select New
Enter 9997 for the port
Select Save

How to Configure the Capture

On your Capture Engine, create a capture called “Splunk”.  
Enable Statistics Output
Select an interval 
o   10 minutes is a good default
o   The smaller the interval the longer components take to refresh in the Splunk App
Select CSV report
Enable Reset Statistics
Select Set Schedule 
Select “Every time”
Specify how many files to keep. 1 should be fine.  More allows the Splunk server to go down for longer periods of time and still catch up.

Changing the Capture name
The reason for the capture name of “Splunk” is because the inputs.conf file in the TA tells the Splunk forwarder which capture to collect CSV files for. If the capture is named something different, then change the name of the folder in the inputs.conf file to match the capture name. “…” can be used in place of the capture name to collect CSV report files from all captures.
Performance Benchmarks
In order for an Omnipliance or an OmniPeek Capture Engine to generate analysis that can be saved to CSV files and ingested into Splunk, certain Analysis Options have to be enabled. Which Analysis Options are enabled depends on what types of analysis will be useful to you. It is important to understand that the more analysis enabled, the lower the performance is going to be. Performance in this case is how much traffic can be captured. 
When creating your Splunk captures, be sure and go to the Analysis Options Tab in the Capture Options Dialog. Here is where the analysis options are configured. By default, everything will be enabled. With everything enabled, the analysis performance, or maximum data rate that can be captured and processed, although dependent on many factors like packet size, number of nodes, protocols, etc.., will be less than 1Gbps. By selectivly disabling analysis that is not important to you, performance will increase siginificantly.
Performance can also be increased by using a smart tap to load balance the traffic over multiple captures on different ports, as well as multiple Omnipliances and OmniPeek Capture Engines.
CSV Files and Splunk sourcetype
In order to generate CSV files that Splunk can index, Analysis Options have to be enabled for the Splunk capture. Each type of CSV file has a list of fields as the first row of the file. The Savvius for Splunk Dashboards uses a seperate sourcetype for each of the different types of CSV files that are imported from the Splunk Forwarder into the Splunk Server. Some of the files share the same data-model and use the same sourcetype. The name of each sourcetype is listed below along with the file of files that it is associated with:

sv_nodes - (Node Statistics-IP.csv, Node Statistics-IPv6.csv, Node Statistics-Physical.csv) List of nodes with byte and packet counts for each

RECOMMENDED SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

Because this App runs on Splunk Enterprise, all of the Splunk Enterprise system requirements apply.

TOPOLOGY AND SETTING UP SPLUNK ENVIRONMENT

This app has been distributed in two parts.
JupiterOne Add-on for Splunk: It collects data from JupiterOne platform.
JupiterOne App for Splunk: It is used for visualizing JupiterOne data.


This app can be set up in two ways:
Standalone Mode:
Install the JupiterOne App for Splunk and JupiterOne Add-on for Splunk.
The JupiterOne App for Splunk uses the data collected by JupiterOne Add-on for Splunk and builds the dashboard on it.


Distributed Environment:
Install the JupiterOne App for Splunk and JupiterOne Add-on for Splunk on the search head. The user only needs to configure an account in JupiterOne Add-on for Splunk but should not create data input.
User needs to manually create an index on the indexer (No need to install JupiterOne App for Splunk or JupiterOne Add-on for Splunk on indexer).





INSTALLATION
Follow the below-listed steps to install an Add-on from the bundle:

Download the App package.
From the UI navigate to Apps-> Manage Apps.
In the top right corner select Install the app from file.
Select Choose File and select the App package.
Select Upload and follow the prompts.

OR

Directly from the Find More Apps section provided in Splunk Home Dashboard.

CONFIGURATION

The App does not require any specific configuration to make but in case of customized configuration of the JupiterOne Add-on for Splunk, the configuration of App has to be changed.

UPGRADE
From v1.1.0 to v1.2.0

No special steps are required to upgrade the JupiterOne App for Splunk from version 1.1.0 to version 1.2.0

From v1.0.0 to v1.1.0

No special steps are required to upgrade the JupiterOne App for Splunk from version 1.0.0 to version 1.1.0

Configure Macros:

If the user has selected a default index (Note: By default, Splunk considers only main index as default index) in ""Data Input"" configuration during JupiterOne Add-on for Splunk's configuration step, then no need to perform this step. But if the user has given any other index in ""Data Input"" configuration, then perform the following steps:


Go to ""Settings"" > ""Advanced search"" > ""Search macros"".
Select ""JupiterOne App for Splunk"" in ""App"" context dropdown.
Click on jupiterone_get_index macro from the shown table.
In the macro definition default value will be index=""main"". Update the definition with the index you used for data collection and save the configurations. For example: index=""<your_index_name>"".

DASHBOARD INFORMATION

J1 Alerts dashboard :
It has following panels:
Active Alerts : This panel gives single value count of alerts that are currently active.
Dismissed Alerts : This panel gives single value count of alerts that are dismissed. 
Active Alerts By Severity : This panel provides the bifurcation of alerts according to the severity.
Alerts Updated Over Time : This panel provides the count of active/dismissed alerts that were updated with relative to time period. 
Active Alert Details :  This panel provides the detailed information of the alerts that are currently active.





TROUBLESHOOTING

If dashboards are not getting populated:
Make sure if you are using the custom index, then check that jupiterone_get_index macro needs to be updated.
Make sure you have data in given time range.
To check whether is data collected or not, run ""jupiterone_get_index | stats count by sourcetype"" query in the search.
Try expanding TimeRange.



UNINSTALL APP

To uninstall app, user can follow below steps: SSH to the Splunk instance -> Go to folder apps($SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps) -> Remove the JupiterOneAppforSplunk folder from apps directory -> Restart Splunk

Who is this app for?
This app is for anyone who wants to display several metrics on a small area of a dashboard.
How does the app work?
This app provides a visualization that you can use in your own apps and dashboards.
To use it in your dashboards, simply install the app, and create a search that provides the values you want to display.
Usecases for the Departures Board Visualization:

Displaying current server metrics like CPU, Memory, I/O, and Disk usage
Scrolling through a list of sales by category or date
Showing related application metrics in a discreet dashboard panel
Rotating through all open Priority 1 ticket numbers

The following fields can be used in the search:

value (required): If you don't define a field called value, the first field will be used to display the value text.
unit (optional): You can define a unit for the value, e.g. '$' or '%'. A value in the unit field will override the default unit configured in settings.
caption (optional): A caption to display for this value. If you define a caption field, it will override the default caption configured in settings.
range (optional): This is usually generated by the rangemap command. It is used to set the color for the slide.

Example Search
| makeresults count=5 
| streamstats count as id
| eval value=case(id==1,42.4, id==2,74, id==3,""2"", id==4,""55"",id==5,""622"") 
| eval unit=case(id==1,""%"", id==2,""MB"", id==3,""%"", id==4,""Mbps"",id==5,""Users"") 
| eval caption=case(id==1,""CPU Use"", id==2,""Free Memory"", id==3,""Free Disk Space"", id==4,""Network Use"",id==5,""Active Users"") 
| eval range=case(id==1,""low"", id==2,""elevated"", id==3,""severe"", id==4,""low"",id==5,""low"") 
| table value, unit, caption, range
Tokens
This visualization supports drilldown and tokens for:
- Caption - $cv_caption$
- Formatted Value - $cv_formatted_value$
- Raw Value - $cv_raw_value$
- Unit - $cv_unit$
Limits

Issues and Limitations

Internet Explorer 11 and Microsoft Edge - Vertical orientation with fixed-sized slides can cause display issues. To workaround this, set the size to Automatic.
Vertical orientation only scrolls in one direction. Setting left-to-right or right-to-left does not affect the direction.
'Show dots' option is ignored for vertical orientation.

Overview
This package contains parsing logic, saved searches, and dashboards for monitoring Trend Micro Deep Security through Splunk.
Please read the Installation section below for details on how to configure Deep Security to use this app.
To contribute this app, see https://github.com/deep-security/splunk.
 

Installation
Install this app through the Manage Apps functionality within Splunk. For additional information on installing Splunk apps, please refer to the Splunk documentation.
It is highly recommended that you follow the Splunk best practices for syslog, and that you configure rsyslog or syslog-ng to write syslog output to a file which can then be collected by a Splunk forwarder and sent to the Splunk server. You need to ensure that the Splunk forwarder sets the sourcetype to deepsecurity when forwarding events to a Splunk receiver.
Alternatively, you can set up a UDP syslog listener directly on the Splunk server and configure it to assign the sourcetype deepsecurity to all messages received.
Next, you'll need to configure Deep Security to send event data to your chosen collection method. Follow this guidance:

To configure system events, log in to Deep Security Manager and go to Administration > System Settings > Event Forwarding.
To configure security events, log in to Deep Security Manager, and go to Policies. Double-click one of your security policies and then go to Settings > Event Forwarding.

For details on event forwarding, see this topic in the Deep Security Help Center.
Upgrade from Version 1.4
All syslog inputs in the Deep Security for Splunk app that were included in version 1.4 have been removed. If you are upgrading from version 1.4 and were using the individual syslog listening ports, you'll need to configure a new syslog input which assigns the sourcetype deepsecurity. This can be a single UDP syslog port in version 1.5.1 and doesn't need to be individual ports as it was in version 1.4.
This change helps make the app compatible with both Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud.
Usage
Please configure Deep Security to send event data in Common Event Format (CEF). This add-on parses the various syslog messages and extracts the appropriate fields, including the custom key/value pairs.
Example:
CEF:0|Trend Micro|Deep Security Agent|8.0.0.995|1001111|Test Intrusion Prevention Rule|3|cn1=1 cn1Label=Host ID dvchost=hostname dmac=00:50:56:F5:7F:47 smac=00:0C:29:EB:35:DE TrendMicroDsFrameType=IP src=192.168.126.150 dst=72.14.204.105 out=1093 cs3=DF 0 cs3Label=Fragmentation Bits proto=TCP spt=49786 dpt=80 cs2=0x00 ACK PSH cs2Label=TCP Flags cnt=1 act=IDS:Reset cn3=10 cn3Label=Intrusion Prevention Packet Position cs5=10 cs5Label=Intrusion Prevention Stream Position cs6=8 cs6Label=Intrusion Prevention Flags
Using the message above as an example, the add-on extracts the following custom key/value pairs:

Fragmentation Bits=DF

Intrusion Prevention Stream Position=10
Intrusion Prevention Flags=8",Version 1.8.2,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/a76f05e4-2794-11ec-8445-767510b1428d.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/about/legal.html?modal=en-english-tm-apps-conditionspdf#,"10,270",0,splunk,4,4,Trend Micro,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/trend_micro,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

1.0

Initial Release

1.1

Minor changes to try to increase performance of the script
Verified app continued to function with splunk 6.5

1.2

Added searchbnf.conf
Added minor error checking in case a user provides a bad delim regex

1.2.1

No one told me there was an error in the script and I guess I didn't test it fully. Stupid typo. :(

1.2.2

I changed the default behavior of the script. If you don't want to specify a delimiter, it will no longer try to split the input. If a bad delimiter is given, it will default to a newline.

2.0

Migrated from intersplunk to the Splunk SDK for Python.
Updated fuzzywuzzy library to latest release
Updated readme file to markdown syntax
Verified compatibility with Splunk 7.0
Set option local = True to force the command to only run on the search head
Made a number of workflow improvements, trying to increase command performance.
Now only bothers to track the maximum ratio matched instead of also tracking the minimum.

2.0.1

Bug fixes to support multivalue input fields again

2.0.2

Documentation updates based on appinspect output.

2.0.3

Prerequisites
This search command is packaged with the following external libraries:
+ Splunk SDK for Python version 1.6.6 (http://dev.splunk.com/python)
+ FuzzyWuzzy 0.17.0 (https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy)
Nothing further is required for this add-on to function.
Installation
Follow standard Splunk installation procedures to install this app.
Reference: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/Overview/Singleserverinstall
Reference: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/Overview/Distributedinstall
Usage
Using a static wordlist provided as input
| fuzzy wordlist=""svchost.exe"" type=""simple"" compare_field=""tester"" output_prefix=""fuzz"" delims=""(\\\\)""

Wordlist is a comma separated list of words you want to check for fuzzy matches.
Type is the type of matching. Reference the library documentation, acceptable values are: simple, partial, token_sort, token_set
Compare_field defaults to _raw and is the field you want to do your fuzzy matching in.
Output_prefix defaults to 'fuzzywuzzy_'.
Delims accepts a regex string, escaped splunk style, and defaults to (\\\\|/|\s+|;|-)

Using a field based wordlist (Version 2.0.4 and later)
| fuzzy wordlist=Creator_Process_Name compare_field=New_Process_Name

Wordlist is a field that exists in each event containing a comma separated list of words
All other options are the same

Sample Use Cases / Searches
Look for process names similar to svchost.exe
eventtype=win_process_new New_Process_Name=* | fuzzy wordlist=""svchost.exe"" compare_field=""New_Process_Name""
Search for Proxy Logs with domainms similar to your company
eventtype=proxy_logs domain=* | fuzzy wordlist=""companydomain1.com,companydomain2.com,companydomain3.com"" compare_field=""domain""
Performance Considerations
There is a nested loop of death whereby the provided wordlist is split and the given input is split. You can improve your performance in the following ways:

Keep your wordlist to a minimum
Keep the regex splitting delimeters to a minimum
Try to filter data before passing it to this command (i.e. don't pass in useless junk)

I use this command in production and will continue to work on improvements but considering the looping that is done, it may always have performance issues.
How it works (basically):

The wordlist is separated
The comparison field is separated by the delimeter string provided
The two are compared
And add the following values to the event output:
prefix_max_match_word
prefix_max_match_ratio

The ratio will contain a value, 0 to 100, where 100 is a perfect match. The word values will contain what actually matched in the input/wordlist combination.

clusterstats is an external python search command packaged as an add-on for
Splunk.
I wrote clusterstats to give stats about clusters of anomalous (slow)
transactions. The search I was working with used transaction to tie related
events into a transaction and add the duration field. I then piped the results
into a command to filter out the normal transactions and leave the slow ones:
| search duration > 3
The command expects to be passed a maxspansecs=X argument and it expects to be
piped events which contain _time and duration fields, and it expects the results
to be in reverse order since it needs to process in time order to calculate the
start of a cluster, the end of a cluster, the number of transactions in the
cluster, the max and mean duration for the cluster. Keep in mind that the max is
probably accurate but the mean is only averaging the duration from the filtered events so it is the mean duration for the cluster of events > than 3 seconds if the above filtering search is used.
The command returns a new set of events to splunk web which represent timings
and statistics from each cluster identified in the original set of events as
determined by the maxspansecs window. The following fields are returned:
_time :                the start time of the cluster
cluster_end_time :     the calculated end time of the event based on the latest
                       transaction end time (transaction start + duration).
cluster_max_duration : the highest duration value from cluster transactions
cluster_mean_duration : the mean of the duration values for the cluster
As a starting point I use the following to nicely format the epoch times and float values after my base search, the transaction command, and the search duration filter above:
| clusterstats maxspansecs=30
| convert timeformat=""%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S"" ctime(cluster_end_time)
as cluster_end_time
| convert timeformat=""%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S"" ctime(cluster_last_txn_start)
as cluster_last_txn_start
| table _time cluster_end_time cluster_txn_count cluster_max_duration
cluster_mean_duration
| eval cluster_max_duration=round(cluster_max_duration,2)
| eval cluster_mean_duration=round(cluster_mean_duration,2)
| rename _time as cluster_start_time
|convert timeformat=""%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S"" ctime(cluster_start_time)
as cluster_start_time

Outcold Solutions provide solutions for monitoring Kubernetes, OpenShift and Docker clusters in Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud. We offer Splunk applications, which give you insights across all containers environments. We are helping businesses to reduce complexity related to logging and monitoring by providing easy-to-use and deploy solutions for Linux and Windows containers. We deliver applications to help developers monitor their applications and operators to keep their clusters healthy. With the power of Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud, we offer a unique solution to help you keep all the metrics and logs in one place, allowing you to quickly address complex questions on container performance and cluster health. 
Description
We provide solutions for monitoring Kubernetes, OpenShift and Docker clusters in Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud. With 10 minutes setup, you will get a monitoring solution, that includes log aggregation, performance and system metrics, metrics from the control plane and application metrics, a dashboard for reviewing network activity, and alerts to notify you about cluster or application performance issues.
All our solutions are powered by the Collectord, a container-native software built by Outcold Solutions that provides capabilities for discovering, transforming and forwarding logs, collecting system metrics, collecting metrics from the control plane of the orchestration frameworks and forwarding network activity. Collectord provides flexible and powerful tools for transforming logs. With our software you can hide sensitive information from the loglines before forwarding them. With Collectord you can reduce the licensing costs associated with logging aggregation by choosing which data you want to forward from the log streams. Collectord forwards container logs, host logs and can discover logs written by the containerized applications.
Use cases
Application Monitoring
See detailed metrics from containers and processes, including performance metrics, utilization metrics and security insights. Forward application-specific metrics, exported in Prometheus format. Use prebuilt Splunk dashboards for a comprehensive overview.
Log Aggregation
Aggregate logs from containers, applications, and servers. Use flexible mappings to filter logs enriched with container metadata, correlate logs with metrics, and leverage Splunk capabilities for analyzing logs. Use Collectord to transform logs before they reach Splunk, remove sensitive information, remove PII data to help keep your logs GDPR compliant. With Collectord you can reduce licensing and storage costs by choosing which loglines you want to forward.
Cluster Health Monitoring
Diagnose cluster issues by looking at historical events, monitoring allocations, and regulating cluster capacity. Leverage pre-built alerts for monitoring the health of the clusters out of the box.
Security and Audit
Define access to the data by clusters, namespaces and even pods or containers. Review network activities, happening inside your cluster, and outside connections. Verify containers running with elevated security permissions. Use audit logs for monitoring changes in deployments.
Reduce complexity and improve productivity
Use one tool to collect and forward logs and metrics required by developers for reviewing performance and health of their applications. With the annotations developers can define how they want to see the data in log aggregation tool, specify multiline log patterns, removing terminal escape codes, override types, sources and indexes.

 Current Version: 2.0.0
 Last Modified: Jan 2016
 Splunk Version: 6.x
 Author: SurfWatch Labs
*

Overview
The Splunk Add-on for SurfWatch Labs API provides a few basic examples for consuming data from the SurfWatch Labs API and ingesting it into Splunk.  Sample data and dashboards are provided to show various ways to leverage the CyberFacts.
Quick Start Guide
There are two ways to work with the Splunk Add-on for SurfWatch Labs API - either you can load a small example dataset that comes with the add-on, or you can get an App ID and App Key for direct access to the SurfWatch Labs.  To acquire keys for authorization, you must either be a current SurfWatch Labs API customer, or be conducting an API trial.  For more information on getting started with a trial account please contact sales@surfwatchlabs.com or go to https://www.surfwatchlabs.com/.
Loading Sample Datasets
If you've just installed the add-on you will see a simple application configuration page.  The page asks for you SurfWatch Labs App ID and App Key.  If you do not have these at this time, you can just click save to skip this step for now (you can always add the values back in either by editing local/sw_api.conf or navigating to $SPLUNK_URL/manager/splunk_ta_surfwatchlabs/apps/local/splunk_ta_surfwatchlabs/setup?action=edit).
Once you are past the application configuration page, go to Settings > Data Inputs > Files & directories and enable one or both of the following:
 $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/splunk_ta_surfwatchlabs/sample_data/cyberfacts.csv
 $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/splunk_ta_surfwatchlabs/sample_data/cyberfacts.json
This will load data into an index called swl_sample_cyberfacts, and it will be associated with either the sample_cyberfact_csv or sample_cyberfact_json sourcetype.
Load Data from the SurfWatch Labs API
There are three ways to load data from the SurfWatch Labs API:  collecting (polling for) new CyberFacts, by backfilling historical CyberFacts, and by allowing realtime datafeeds.
Note that to get data from the SurfWatch Labs API, you will need a valid App ID and App Key.
Collecting CyberFacts
The easiest way to get started is to leverage the provided get_csv_cyberfacts.py and  get_json_cyberfacts.py input scripts.  If enabled (Settings > Data Inputs > Scripts > get_[csv|json]cyberfacts.py > Enable), these scripts will poll the SurfWatch Labs API once a day in the middle of the night (GMT).  You can always adjust when they are run through the Splunk UI (Settings > Data Inputs > Scripts > get[csv|json]_cyberfacts.py > click) or by modifying inputs.conf.
Backfilling & Collecting CyberFacts
If you'd like to backfill your index, that is, get all historical CyberFacts there are two provided backfill scripts - backfill_csv_cyberfacts.py and backfill_json_cyberfacts.py.  If you enable (Settings > Data Inputs > Scripts > backfill_[csv|json]_cyberfacts.py > Enable ) these scripts will begin running and starting from yesterday, get a days worth of data, sleep for a few seconds, and then get another days worth of data backwards in time.  These scripts are meant to be enabled around the same time as get_[csv|json]_cyberfacts.py script so that no data gaps should occur.
Note that once the script finishes gathering data you will need to disable it so that it does not get executed again.
Collecting CyberFacts in realtime
To truly collect CyberFacts in realtime you will need to leverage the SurfWatch Labs Realtime API. This will require you to allow incoming POST requests from SurfWatch Labs into your Splunk environment to an endpoint you configure.  For more information please see https://www.surfwatchlabs.com/ or contact support@surfwatchlabs.com.
CSV and JSON data formats
The Splunk Add-on for SurfWatch Labs API has examples for consuming CyberFacts in both CSV and JSON formats.  Conceptually we consider the CyberFact to be a nested object mapping (an object containing arrays of objects), and so JSON is a natural fit.  However, our CSV format denormalizes this (similar to a dataframe) and so you can ask all of the same questions that you can with the JSON data format.  Which to use really comes down to the kinds of questions you want to ask, and personal preference.  For most people we recommend using the CSV data format in Splunk.
Searching CyberFacts
By default the same data scripts will populate an index called swl_sample_cyberfacts, and all scripts against the SurfWatch Labs API will populate an index called swl_cyberfacts.  Once you ingest some data you should be able to see it by searching these indexes or by using the Search the sample CyberFacts and Search for CyberFacts timeline navigation items.
Visualizing CyberFacts
Two sample dashboards are provided to show various ways to visualize CyberFact data.  There are dashboards to show filtering the data by data feed and by Industry, as well as other ways to use the data.
Upgrading from Splunk Add-on for SurfWatch Labs API 1.x to 2.x
The Splunk Add-on for SurfWatch Labs API 2.x uses the same index name (swl_cyberfacts) as 1.x, however in 2.x we renamed the sourcetype cyberfact to cyberfact_json, and introduced a new sourcetype cyberfact_csv.  The example dashboard was also renamed from cyberfacts to cyberfacts_json, and a new companion cyberfacts_csv was added. The input scripts were renamed, once again creating a '_json' and '_csv' pair where before only one  (that dealt with JSON) existed.  And lastly, we've added sample data and added an index swl_sample_cyberfacts and two sourcetypes, sample_cyberfact_csv and sample_cyberfact_json to differentiate this data from potentially production-use data.
It is recommended before upgrading that all input scripts are disabled, and if possible the swl_cyberfact index emptied of data.  If you don't delete the data it will be ok, however all new searches will need explicit sourcetypes (which isn't a bad practice anyways).
To delete data from the SurfWatch Labs index:
$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk stop
$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk clean eventdata -index swl_cyberfacts
$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk start
Misc
Note that the primary intention of this add-on is to highlight how to get data from the SurfWatch Labs API into your Splunk instance.  A variety of factors specific to your environment (Splunk license indexing rates, single vs distributed indexes, data needs, accounting for Splunk downtime, etc) may require you to tweak settings.  For questions you can always contact support@surfwatchlabs.com.

Resolved Issues in V 3.5.0

An issue where Security Intelligence Category was not populating properly in Connection events. It is now populating correctly.
An issue where the egress interface was populating with the id instead of the interface name in Intrusion events. It is now populating with the name.
An issue where the fw_policy field name was appearing in Splunk file event output even though the firewall policy name is not part of the file event. The field name has been removed.
An issue where the log reported a process poll timeout error even though the process is healthy and operating normally. The issue has been corrected.
An issue where the name of the source user field was not populating correctly in connection events, intrusion events, file events, and malware events. The field is now populating correctly.
An issue where the sid field in intrusion events was populating with an ""internal sid"" instead of the ""rendered sid"". If a user imports a custom rule file with rules that specify the sid, that sid is the ""rendered sid"" that appears in the FMC interface. The sid field in intrusion events is now populated by the rendered sid.
An issue where the DNS Query field in connection event was not populating correctly. It is now populating correctly.
An issue where in malware events, the virus name/detection name field was not populating correctly. It is now populating correctly.
An issue where eNcore reported the following error: ""UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters … "". The issue has been resolved.
An issue where the packet payload output included layer 2-4 headers for TCP and UDP packets. The issue has been corrected and only the payload (without the layer 2-4 headers) appears in the payload field.
An issue where in correlation events, the cs1 field (for access control policy name) was populating with the uuid instead of the name.

So this is the part of getting data out of Splunk to CMDM, also called discovery.The first integration into the CMDM is focused on ServiceNow CMDB (including relationships), Incidents, Problems, Changes, Users, and Groups. I like to say that this offers a functional integration of ServiceNow with Splunk. As an example one can ask the CMDM to: give me all open incidents for the ServiceNow groups that a particular user belongs to, or give me all servers/hosts that are part of a certain business application. All ServiceNow CMDB/CSDM tables are supported and one can specify which fields/attributes to get over to the CMDM.This CMDM app is not containing the logic/scripts to get information out of ServiceNow and put that into CMDM. For that a separate container is necessary that has access to the internet, to connect to the ServiceNow API, and connects to where the CMDM underlying Neo4j Graph database is located. Please contact the developer for more information.This app also contains a new search command called ""gwriter"" to write Splunk content back to CMDM (Neo4j).To query the CMDM the free ""Neo4j Commands app"" is needed.The CMDM is relying on the popular and most known graph database called Neo4j. The CMDM can work with all of their editions from community to enterprise to SAAS edition.And don't let you discourage by the version of this app as the backend code (ServiceNow part) is ready. This CMDM app is going to have a front-end for the configuration of the back-end.

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3396,2022-01-10,07:28:26 AM,URLParser,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/screenshots/5672a66c-b649-11e6-a70b-064a37f1a5b3.png,"Nov. 29, 2016","URLParser
URLParser is a custom search command designed to parse URLs. Because it relies on the new chuncked protocol, URLParser is compatible starting with Splunk 6.4.0 and above.
 ... | urlparser [field=fieldname] [listname=""*|iana|mozilla|...""] [mode=[simple|extended]]
URLParser is a community supported app and compared to UTBox, URLParser is faster, extract more fields and is easier to use.
Extracted fields
URLParser will extract the following fields form the submitted URLs:

url_domain
url_domain_without_tld
url_fragment
url_hostname
url_netloc
url_params 
url_password
url_path
url_port
url_query
url_scheme
url_subdomain
url_subdomain_depth
url_subdomain_parts
url_tld
url_username

The field url_subdomain_parts can also be processed by Splunk spath command to access to individual parts of the subdomain (url_subdomain.1, url_subdomain.2, ...).
Usage
The command signature is the following:
... | urlparser [field=fieldname] [mode=[simple|extended]] [listname=""listname1|listname2|...""]
All arguments are optional and default values are set to the following:
 field: url
 mode : extended
* listname: mozilla
The simplest way to call urlparser is as follow:
... | urlparser
In the previous example, urlparser will automatically works with the field 'url', load the 'mozilla' suffix list and perform an 'extended' extraction of the fields.
Example
This example demonstrates the parsing of a 'complex' URL and how the Splunk spath command can be used to leverage the url_subdomain_parts field.
 | stats count
 | fields - count
 | eval url = ""hTTp://je@n:pass:w@rd@images.www.gOOGle.Co.uk:256/iDNex.php?var=CALue32&ouech=gros#pouet""
 | urlparser
 | spath input=url_subdomain_parts
 | transpose
This simple example also illustrates that the case of the input URL is unchanged by URLParser, which is a fundamental to work with URLs containing Base64 data for example (exfiltration scenarios and alike). Users willing to normalize URL in lower case can easily do it by using Splunk's eval command and it's lower() function.
Pro Tips
It is a good habit to filter URLs prior sending them to urlparser to avoid empty url fields, or url set as '-' (often seen in proxy logs).
... | search url=* url!=""-"" | urlparser
In some situation, using the stats command to deduplicate repeted url can be desirable.
Scripted Lookup
URLParser is also accessible as a scripted lookup. This will be useful for situations where the custom search command cannot be used like if you are building a datamodel. The scripted lookup is slower than the custom search command.
... | eval list=""iana|mozilla"" | lookup urlparser_lookup url list
To pass a string argument to a scripted lookup, a little trick need to be used as illustrated with the previous example. In this example, the lists to use are set to 'iana' and 'mozilla' by a prelimerary call to the Splunk eval command.
Where are the statistical functions from UTBox?
URLParser will focus on everything about URL Parsing. In short, computing the shannon entropy of a word, whether that'd be a domain name or not, is not part of the process of parsing a URL. 
Options
mode
The mode option, admit two values: 'simple', or 'extended' so it's usage is straightforward:

mode=simple
mode=extended

In case of an unknown submission, the default mode 'extended' is used.
The mode 'simple' only call python's method urlparse() to extract basic elements from URLs and the mode 'extended' extract many more elements like the TLD, the subdomain, the domain without the TLD, etc.
listname
The listname option allows to specify one or more lists of known TLDs to load. URLParser is shipped with two default lists, the IANA list and the Mozilla Public Suffix List but users can define their own custom lists to either complement, or replace, the default lists. Multiple lists can be loaded by specifying the separator ""|"" (pipe). 
Examples:

listname=""iana""         : load the TLD from the list 'iana' (one of the default lists)
listname=""custom""       : load the TLD from the list 'custom' (user defined list)
listname=""mozilla|iana"" : load the TLD from both 'iana' and 'mozilla' lists (default provided lists)
listname=""iana|pouet""   : load the TLD from the list 'iana' (default list) and the list 'pouet' (user defined list)
listname=""iana|pouet|custom|mylist"" : load the TLD from the lists 'iana', 'pouet', 'custom' and 'mylist'
listname=""*""           : load the TLD from all available lists (lists present in the suffix_lists directory)

There is no limit to the number of lists one can load and the TLDs present in multiple lists are loaded only once (the underneath logic is a boolean OR).
Lists files are stored under the application directory ($APP_DIR/suffix_lists) and must be named following this syntax: suffix_list_\<name lowercase>.dat
Examples: 

suffix_list_mozilla.dat
suffix_list_iana.dat
suffix_list_custom.dat
suffix_list_pouet.dat

Creating a custom list
This section describes what is the formalism expected for the content of a custom list:

One TLD per line
Comments are ignored (lines starting by ""#"" or ""//"")
TLD must NOT start with a dot ("".com"" is wrong, ""com"" is correct)
Support the Mozilla Suffix List logic (wildcards and question marks)

Example:
// This is my custom list
pouet
\*.yata
!coco.yata
Line 1: define ""pouet"" as a TLD.
www.domain.pouet: TLD=pouet, Domain=domain.pouet
Line 2: define that everything under "".yata"" is part of the TLD 
www.domain.cw.yata: TLD=cw.yata, Domain=domain.cw.yata
www.domain.hehe.yata: TLD=hehe.yata, Domain=domain.hehe.yata
Line 3: define an exception for the .yata TLD: coco.yata is NOT a TLD.
www.domain.coco.yata: TLD=yata, Domain=coco.yata
Is it fast?
Those tests are just an indication of performances and were realized on a MacBook Pro over a sample dataset of proxy logs with Splunk 6.5.1.
URLParser (scripted lookup)

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1397,2022-01-10,07:28:45 AM,Scale Command,,"March 7, 2013","Using the scale command, you can scale fields matching a pattern by a fixed scale or by a field from each event. This replaces multiple calls to eval for transforming several fields from one unit to the other, such as byte to Megabyte. Optionally you can specify rounding to any precision and choose between division and multiplication to scale up or down easily.
Examples
... | scale scale=1048576 pattern=byte round=0
Converts fields matching the pattern ""byte"" to megabyte, rounding to whole MB.
... | scale scale=60 pattern=""^[^_]""
Converts every numeric field not starting with an underscore, e.g. _time, from seconds to minutes.
... | scale field=Total pattern=""^sum"" | scale scale=100 pattern=""^sum"" round=2 inverse=t
Translates every field starting with ""sum"" into percentages of Total, rounded to two decimal places.
Examples expressed using the Splunk 6 foreach command
Here's how the examples from above would look like using the foreach command added in Splunk 6:
... | foreach *byte* [eval <<FIELD>> = round(<<FIELD>> / 1048576)]
Matching for ""field doesn't start with an underscore"" isn't possible with only wildcards, so example 2 still requires the scale command.
... | foreach sum* [eval <<FIELD>> = round(<<FIELD>> / Total * 100, 2)]

Main goal of Apius SSHFS Helper is to provide easy way to access and monitor files without using SplunkForwarder on remote, production servers. SSHFS Helper requires only user account with read rights to log files on remote servers and of course ssh daemon running.  After you set up connection, the only thing you need to do, is to configure file monitor input as you would do on local file system. 
Apius SSHFS Helper does not require Splunk to be run on root account. It takes care on all mount points be restored as soon as you restart Splunk or reboot server. 
Prerequisites
Apius SSHFS Helper requires following packages on a server, where you plan to install it:
Linux 2.6 (product was tested on Ubuntu Server, but all distributions should also work OK)
OpenSSH client including: 
   ssh, ssh-keyscan and ssg-keygen,
   fusefs support in kernel,
   fusermount tool, 
   sshfs package installed 
Apius SSHFS Helper can not be installed in Splunk Universal Forwarder, but you may use it with Heavy Forwarder. 
Usage
Apius SSHFS Helper may be configured using application’s user interfaces, as standard input (Settings » Data Inputs) or with inputs.conf file. Preferred method is using application’s GUI. 
SSHFS Helper supports password and private key authentication. Configuration procedure is following:
Install application using provided sshfs.spl file and allow Splunk to restart afterwards. Choose Apius SSH Helper app. 
Enter correct values for all entries and press Add new button. 
If everything is correct, you will be presented with next screen, where you have to provide credentials (password or private key). Verify fingerprint of server’s key, choose authentication method  and then type your password or paste private key in a field. Press Add this host.
Next screen will show you all your connections. Copy to clipboard mountpoint of your connection and proceed as usual to configure file monitor input: Settings » Data inputs » Files & directories 
Path of the data you want to index will start with directory you have in clipboard. 
Remarks
If you want to provide private key without using application’s GUI (using Settings » Data Inputs menu or directly within inputs.conf) enter it without spaces, newlines and headers. If you have id_rsa, id_dsa or id_ecdsa file, you need to convert it using simple unix command: 
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa | grep -v ""PRIVATE KEY-----"" | tr -d '\n' | sed ’s/$/\n/g'
Additionally you have to accept server public key in your OS, before saving a new input using account on which splunkd is running. To do so simply connect to the server with 'ssh' command and accept host fingerprint. 
Every secret(password or private key) is replaced with '', after adding/modifying the input. If you want to change stored secret - replace '' with a new one (it will be encrypted after saving input). Please read http://blogs.splunk.com/2011/03/15/storing-encrypted-credentials , to know how does Splunk store credentials.
Activated input will keep remote filesystem mounted. It does not output any events and do not need any index.You can monitor files and directories in remote filesystem, as if they were local.
Limitations
Always enable input before removing it, even when credentials are incorrect. Stored password or private key won't be removed if you delete disabled input.

Add-on Upgrade Guide - For existing Microsoft Graph Security Add-on for Splunk on Splunk Enterprise upgrade to 1.1.0

Register a new application for the Splunk Add-On
These steps are needed to authenticate with the Microsoft Graph Security API.
Follow these steps to register a new application:  

Sign in to the Azure Portal with your work or school account. Note: this stage does not require an AAD tenant admin.
Select Azure Active Directory (1).
Select App registrations (2).

Select New registration (3).



In the new registration form that opens, enter an application name (4).


Select Register (5).



Next, you'll see the overview page and your app ID (7), and Directory (tenant) ID (8). Copy and save these fields. You will need them later to complete the configuration process.


Click on View API Permissions (9) to display the Graph permissions screen.



In the API Permission screen, click on the Add a permission button (11) and select  Microsoft Graph (12).



Next, select Application permissions (13) in the Request API permission pane that opens.



Under Request API permissions, select SecurityEvents.Read.All (14). Then click Add permissions (15).


[This step needs to be completed by the Azure Active Directory tenant admin] Login to the Azure Portal as the Azure Active Directory Tenant Administrator for your organization and navigate to App registration/API permissions screen. Click on Grant admin consent for 'the AAD tenant' (16).



Under Certificates & secrets (17), choose New client secret (18). A new secret will be displayed in the Value column. Copy this password – this is the only time you’ll be able to. You will need it later to complete the configuration process.



Install the Add-on


In Splunk home screen, on the left side sidebar, click ""+ Find More Apps"" in the apps list, or click the gear icon next to Apps then select Browse more apps.



Search for Microsoft Graph Security in the text box, find the Microsoft Graph Security API Add-On for Splunk and click Install. To learn more about where to install this add-on, please refer to the instructions below under Where to install this add-on section.



If Splunk Enterprise prompts you to restart, do so.


Verify that the add-on appears in the list of apps and add-ons as shown in the diagram below.



Configuring Microsoft Graph Security data inputs

NOTE: There are changes in the configuration data inputs with the Microsoft Graph Security Add-on for Splunk version 1.1.0. In the previous Microsoft Graph Security Add-on for Splunk version 0.1.1, Application ID and Client Secret are entered directly under the Inputs tab. In the Microsoft Graph Security Add-on for Splunk version 1.1.0, these app credentials won't appear under the Inputs tab. The app credentials like Application ID and Client Secret need to be entered while creating a new Account in the Configuration tab.  


From the app list, select Microsoft Graph Security API Add-On for Splunk.
Navigate to the Configuration page, then select Account tab. Then click Add to create an account. 

Enter a unique Account Name, Application ID and Client Secret registered in the earlier section Register a new application for the Splunk Add-On.



Navigate to the Inputs page, select Create New Input.

Enter a unique name for the data input.
Set an interval greater or equal to 300 seconds.
Select an index to store your alerts.
From the steps above, enter your Azure Tenant ID.
[Optional step] Set OData filter if needed – check list of curated query samples for ready to use Microsoft Graph Security API queries.
For App Account, select the account created in Step 3 from the list of the app accounts already created under Configuration tab. 
Click Add.

Now you can search and create Splunk dashboards using your Microsoft Graph Security Alerts.



Notes

The first time an input is created, it will pull as many Microsoft Graph Security alerts as possible. Then all subsequent requests will pull alerts with the lastModifiedDateTime between the set interval and the current time.
If you create multiple inputs, the add-on will have multiple data streams from the Microsoft Graph Security API resulting in duplicate alerts.
For this add-on: sourcetype=GraphSecurityAlert

Optional: Configure Proxy settings
If you have Splunk and relevant add-ons running behind a proxy server, follow these additional steps. Refer to the following diagram for details.

Go to the Configuration tab of the add-on.
Enter your proxy information under the Proxy tab.
Click Save.

The Add-on will now use your proxy settings.

Where to install this add-on
Unless otherwise noted, all supported add-ons can be safely installed to all tiers of a distributed Splunk platform deployment. See Where to install Splunk add-ons in Splunk Add-ons for more information.
See Splunk Cloud install documentation for Splunk Cloud install. 
This table provides a reference for installing this specific add-on to a distributed deployment of Splunk.

Supported
Required
Comments




Search Heads
Yes
Yes
This add-on contains search-time knowledge. It is recommended to turn visibility off on your search heads to prevent data duplication errors that can result from running inputs on your search heads instead of (or in addition to) on your data collection node.


Heavy Forwarders
Yes
No (but recommended)
It is recommended to install this add-on on a heavy forwarder for data collection.  Data collection should be configured in only 1 place to avoid duplicates.


Indexers
Yes
No
Not required as the parsing operations occur on the forwarders.


Universal Forwarders
No
No
Universal forwarders are not supported for data collection because the modular inputs require Python and the Splunk REST handler.



Add-on Upgrade Guide

NOTE: If you've had the 0.1.1 version installed, a best practice for upgrading the Microsoft Graph Security API add-on for Splunk is to remove your older version before re-installing version 1.1.0 of the Microsoft Graph Security API add-on for Splunk. If you are uninstalling and reinstalling the Microsoft Graph Security API add-on for Splunk, follow the steps for New Installation above.

The following migration guide is supported for upgrading from Microsoft Graph Security API add-on for Splunk version 0.1.1 to Microsoft Graph Security API add-on for Splunk versions 1.1.0 and higher.
If you are upgrading on Splunk Enterprise, follow these steps.

Disable all your inputs before you upgrade the add-on. Otherwise you may see errors in the log files which may result data loss against your already configured inputs.
On the app list, navigate to the Microsoft Graph Security add-on for Splunk, to see an option to upgrade the app. Click on Update button.

A new screen appears with the standard Splunk Terms to upgrade an app. Click Accept and Continue.



Enter your username and password to log in the app. Click Login and Continue.

This Technology Addon provides index time parsing and search time extractions (CIM mapping) for the barracuda
 NGX firewalls.
See:
https://community.barracudanetworks.com/forum/index.php?/topic/27286-syslog-message-format/
Barracuda data will be ingested as syslog data, the strongly recommended approach is using a syslog receiver
(rsyslog, syslog-ng), and having Splunk with UF deployment monitoring the log files.
Otherwise, Splunk can act as the syslog receiver, but this approach has various limitations compared to the much
 more robust receiver deployment.
Barracuda firewalls will essentially provide 2 formats for the syslog data:

An header less mode where ""|"" is used as the delimiter, use the sourcetype ""barracuda_ngx_raw""
when designing your inputs.
A Key / Value mode, very convenient for Splunk and easier to read for humans, use the sourcetype ""barracuda_ngx_kv""
 when designing your inputs.

Deploy this TA to:

Indexers (standalone or clustered)
Search Heads
Intermediate Heavy Forwarders, if any

Compatability
The Cybereason App for Splunk enables you to gain deep insight & visibility into your endpoints, detect advanced attacks based on AI hunting, and take response actions within Splunk. The Cybereason AI Hunting Engine automatically asks a complex set of questions of data collected from all of your endpoints at a rate of 8 million calculations per second, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This means the solution is continuously hunting on your behalf by asking the same sorts of questions advanced security analysts would ask as they hunt for threats inside an environment. The difference, however, is that the Cybereason malicious activity models run constantly, and continually adapt and evolve according to the data the solution receives and analyzes.
When the Cybereason AI Hunting Engine identifies malicious behavior, its classified based on context and severity. Suspicions represent multiple pieces of anomalous behavior which are related and therefore more likely to be malicious. Malops (malicious operations) are a collection of related suspicious activities that are highly likely to indicate a security incident, and are defined in a way that minimizes the likelihood of analysts spending time investigating benign activities or false positives. Both Suspicions and Malops are presented in Splunk along with insights that give context to the alerts so you can quickly understand what is happening in your environment.

Download
Download Cybereason For Splunk at https://splunkbase.splunk.com.
Installation steps
NOTE: Where referenced, the IA-CybereasonForSplunk and TA-CybereasonForSplunk versions of this App are located on Splunkbase.
Deploy to single server instance
Follow these steps to install the app in a single server instance of Splunk Enterprise:


Deploy as you would any App, and restart Splunk.


Install IA-CybereasonForSplunk.


Configure.


Deploy to Splunk Cloud


Have your Splunk Cloud Support handle this installation. Do NOT install the IA on the same system as the App.


You may consider using an on-premise Heavy Forwarder to install IA-CybereasonForSplunk, and send the logs to Splunk Cloud.


Deploy to a Distributed Environment


For each Search Head in the environment, deploy a non-configured copy of the App. DO NOT SEND TA or IA to a Search Head Cluster (SHC).


For each indexer in the environment, deploy a copy of the TA-CybereasonForSplunk Add-On that is located as mentioned above.


For a single Data Collection Node OR Heavy Forwarder (a full instance of Splunk is required), install IA-CybereasonForSplunk and configure through the GUI.


User Guide
Configure Cybereason For Splunk


Install the App according to your environment (see steps above)


Navigate to App > IA-CybereasonForSplunk > Administration > Application Configuration


Application Configuration Dashboard
To configure the Cybereason application you should start on the Application Configuration page (Administration > Application Configuration)*[]:
Application Configuration
On this screen you can set the base index via event type as well as indicating that you have configured the app. Make sure you click the SAVE button to access the additional dashboards.
Encrypted Credentials
You can view/delete existing credentials on this tab. These are credentials that are being used by existing modular inputs in the Cybereason application. These credentials are the credentials used to connect to Cybereason appliances.
Cybereason
On this screen you can view and make any changes to existing modular inputs. As you make changes and tab between fields the modular input is modified.
Creating New Credentials
By default creating a new modular input with a username and password specified will create the necessary encrypted credentials. However if you want to create encrypted credentials manually follow this process:


Navigate to the Credentials tab.


To create a new encrypted credential, click the Create New Credential button and fill in with the appropriate username and password.


The realm is the application name where the encrypted credential is created + the username.


NOTE: By default creating a new modular input will automatically create a new encrypted credential so this process is not necessary unless you need a new credential for another purpose.
Updating Existing Credentials
If you want to update existing credentials manually follow this process:


Navigate to the “Cybereason” tab.


Copy the Credential Realm of the Input for which credentials have to be updated.


Navigate to the “Credential” tab.


Search for the Credential using the copied Credential Realm.


Delete the existing Credential of that Credential Realm using the delete button.


To update credential, click the Create New Credential button and fill in with the appropriate information below:

Username (The username of the configured input)
Password (The new password for that username) 
Realm (Credential Realm of the configured input)



Creating New Cybereason Inputs
NOTE: You will need to configure a new modular input for each Cybereason host.
NOTE: The Suspicious data type should be only pulled 1 once per day. This particular input pulls all available suspicious items, not just the time-based delta, at the time of ingest. Please configure a separate input with interval 600 for the suspicious data type.


To create a new data input, click the Create New Cybereason Input button and fill in the following fields. Those with a red asterisk on the screen are required.


Modular Input Name: Name for the data input configuration.


Base URL: The hostname or IP address and port of the Cybereason service. By default you can specify hostname:443.


Username: The username used to connect to the service.


Password: The password for the previously specified service.


Toggle all data keys: Check to select all data keys.


Data keys: List of endpoints available on the Cybereason service. Check the data key if you wish to pull event data.


Interval: The number of seconds indicate how often the input will poll for new data. This setting must be at least 60.


Index: This sets the index for data to be written to. This setting should be changed from default, which normally writes to the main index, to a specified index for best performance. The index must exist on the Search Head and Indexer.




After creating the modular input you may need to disable/re-enable the input in Settings > Data Inputs > Cybereason For Splunk to activate the input.


NOTE: When configuring the modular input through the Application Configuration dashboard, the password is automatically encrypted into the credential store. If you need to change the credential, create a new credential, and reference the host/user pair in the modular input configuration. An encrypted credential is required for this Splunk App.
Indexes
By default all events will be written to the main index. You should change the index in the configuration files to match your specific index.
Troubleshoot Cybereason For Splunk


Check the Monitoring Console (>=v6.5) for errors

This application ingests the Unified2 logs from Barnyard2 on a pfSense firewall using Snort, that is configured to output the information to Splunk via the UDP protocol on port 514. The application is configured to do multiline reads of the incoming data and provides a graphical display on the dashboard along with a map pinpointing the source IP location. The application sets the default dashboard from Splunk to that of the application.
This app is maintained by Darryl Mackay darryl_mackay@axxess.co.za. Suggestions for improvements and fixes for problems are welcome.

Key concepts for Nimble Storage App for Splunk
When you load the Nimble Storage app you will see a list of all of the arrays that you have configured Modular Inputs for in the TA for Nimble Storage. 
Clicking on an array will give you a list of all of the volumes on that array on the left side and an array status box that will show syslog events from the array.
Clicking on a volume will show you a performance graph for that volume.",Version 1.1.1,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/486d1dbc-349a-11e6-afc3-06caea5ac9f9.png,IT Operations,http://info.nimblestorage.com/rs/364-BLA-665/images/Nimble-Storage-License-for-Splunk-App.pdf,654,0,splunk,0,0,Nimble Storage,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/NimbleStorage,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

OVERVIEW
Hurricane Labs Open Port Detection is the second half of the TA-opd app. This app goes on your search head. TA-opd goes
on your Heavy Forwarder which will then index the OPD data into sourcetype=opd.
If you already have TA-opd installed and configured then you're good to go with this app. If you don't, you'll want to
get that set up first. See the TA-opd app README for details.
SPLUNK VERSION SUPPORT
7.0, 6.6
INSTALLATION

Make sure TA-opd is installed on a Heavy Forwarder and is sending data to sourcetype=opd.
Optionally configure this app to connect to SA-Shodan

FEATURES
Alerts
- 'OPD - Newly Opened Ports' alert can be set up to alert you whenever a newly opened port is seen.
   - This alert is disabled by default.
- Any item tagged as 'baseline' will not be included in this alert.

Suppressions
- You can suppress specific ports and / or specific hosts utilizing eventtypes.
- You can suppress by creating an eventtype that starts with ""opd_baseline"" like so:
    Create a new eventtype called opd_baseline_custom_suppression and add ""index=opd dest_ip=1.2.3.4 dest_port=80""
    as the contents.

Saved Searches
- 'OPD Shodan Lookup Populator' (optional) - If configured to connect to the SA-Shodan app this search
will be enabled. It will then populate the opd_shodan KV Store with all your devices that have open ports.
    - By default this runs once a day, but can be configured to run more frequently.
This lookup will be used in the 'OPD Shodan' saved search.
- 'OPD - Newly opened ports' (optional) - Alerts whenever a new port is discovered within the last 7 days.
- 'OPD Shodan' (optional) - Uses the opd_shodan KV Store populated from above to find out if any of your open
port devices are also discovered on Shodan.

Dashboards
- OPD
    - Allows you to search for a specific IP and hostname.
    - 'OPD New Ports Detected' search is based off the alert of the same name.
- OPD Shodan (Optional)
    - Shows any of your devices found through Shodan's API (Requires SA-Shodan app to work:
    https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1766/)
    - NOTE: This dashboard relies on the opd_shodan lookup being populated. If you enable Shodan with no OPD inputs / data
    coming in for OPD, then this will be empty. If this dashboard is not showing results, make sure that data is coming
    in for OPD, then re-run the saved search 'OPD Shodan Lookup Populator' which will populate the opd_shodan lookup.

Setup
- If you have the SA-Shodan app installed then you can optionally set this app up to check your open
ports against Shodan

RELEASE NOTES
v2.1.0

Minor dashboard cosmetic changes.

v2.0

Added dashboards, configuration page and additional saved searches for Shodan connection

Support

Splunk ^8.0

How This App Works
This app pulls down lookups from the Hurricane Labs getThreats API. Corresponding threatlist inputs then ingest
the lookup data into the appropriate threatlist.
Purchasing an API Key

Go here https://www.hurricanelabs.com/threat-intelligence-feed to request an API key.

Setup Process


Go to 'Apps' < 'Manage Apps'


Find the 'Hurricane Labs Threat Intelligence Feed' app, and then click 'Launch App'


Once taken to the app, click on the 'Setup' link in the navigation


Enable the threatlist inputs. By default these are set to disabled = true. You can enable these one of two ways:

Directly in inputs.conf
Go to Configure < Data Enrichment < Intelligence Downloads and enable the following Intelligence Downloads:
misp_IPDST, misp_MD5SUMs, misp_SHA1SUMs, misp_SHA256SUMs, misp_URL, misp_Domains



(Non-Cloud Only)
3. Enable the scripted input in inputs.conf.
- By default the scripted input runs every hour. If it is decided to change this interval, and your environment is
clustered, then it is not recommended to use CRON scheduling for the scripted input.
- Confirm the scripted input has run by searching index=_internal ""ExecProcessor"" ""threatlist_handler.py"". If it
successfully ran you will get results back. Ensure log_level is INFO. 
- If you see no results, you can force the scripted input to run by running debug/refresh.
(Cloud Only or Non-Cloud)
3. Enable the Saved Search HLThreatIntelligence Populator to start populating your Threat Lists as 
Scripted Inputs will be removed on Splunk Cloud. 
- It is recommended to schedule the saved search to run hourly as the default retention on the Threat Intelligence Downloads
is set to 1 hour by default. 
- Once the Saved Search has run, you can confirm it is running successfully by running the following search:
index=_internal sourcetype=scheduler savedsearch_name=""HLThreatIntelligence Populator"" | table _time status
- You can also manually run | hlthreatintel to make sure everything works as expected. Errors from running this
search should appear in both the messages window as well as the results output. If no results are returned then
everything should be working as expected.
Upgrading (IMPORTANT)
Upgrading From 1.0.6 or Earlier

Starting in version 1.0.7 the setup process has changed slightly as the setup.xml file has been removed in the default 
folder to meet Splunk Cloud approval. See the Setup Process section in this README.
This app no longer supports anything less than Splunk version 8 as it is required to set the app's Python version to 3 for 
meet AppInspect requirements.

Upgrading From Version 1.0.3 or Earlier
If you are upgrading from 1.0.3 or earlier version you will need to either do one of 
two things as the setup page functionality has changed:
1. Re-enter the API key on the setup page.
- OR -
2. Change the stanza name in the passwords.conf file to be [credential::api_key:]. After a debug/refresh
the new API key should be seen. 
The reason for the above is the app up to version 1.0.3 utilized the standard Splunk setup page which made it
impossible to update an API key while also overwriting the old API key in passwords.conf. This update fixes
this issue, but because of this change one of the above changes needs to be made.
Configure Threat Intelligence Downloads Retention
By default, the retention for the Threat Intelligence Downloads provided in this app are set to -1h. If you adjust
this, consider adjusting the schedule for the scripted input threatlist_handler.py(non-cloud) or saved search 
HLThreatIntelligence Populator (cloud).
You can modify the Threat Intelligence Download settings by going to Configure < Data Enrichment < Intelligence Downloads
in Enterprise Security, and then finding the threat downloads (misp_IPDST, misp_MD5SUMs, misp_SHA1SUMs, 
misp_SHA256SUMs, misp_URL, misp_Domains).
Further information regarding Threat Intelligence Download retention is provided via the Splunk Documentation here: 
https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ES/5.3.1/Admin/Changethreatintel
The above link contains the following information:
Remove threat intelligence from the KV Store collections in Splunk Enterprise Security based on the date that the 
threat intelligence was added to Enterprise Security.

The default maximum age is -30d for 30 days of retention in the KV Store. To remove the data more often, use a 
smaller number such as -7d for one week of retention. To keep the data indefinitely, use a blank field. However, 
if the KV Store collection is stored indefinitely, the .csv files that result from lookup-generating searches can 
grow large enough to impact search head cluster replication performance. If you manually delete the data from the 
.csv file, the maximum age timer does not reset based on the edit date, and the data is still removed from the 
KV Store after the maximum age expires.

If the threat intelligence source is not a TAXII feed, define the maximum age of the threat intelligence. This 
field is not used for TAXII feeds.

- From the Enterprise Security menu bar, select Configure > Data Enrichment > Intelligence Downloads.
- Select an intelligence source.
- Change the Maximum age setting using a relative time specifier.
- Enable the retention search for the collection.
- From the Splunk platform menu bar, select Settings and click Searches, reports, and alerts.
- Search for ""retention"" using the search filter.
- Enable the retention search for the collection that hosts the threat source. All retention searches 
are disabled by default.

Additionally, the Sinkhole option is set to false by default. If you wish to delete the lookups after
they have been added to the Threat Intelligence you will need to enable the Sinkhole for both the Threat Intel Input
as well as the Threat Intelligence Modular Input. 
See corresponding Splunk documentation (Configure threat intelligence file retention):
https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ES/6.1.0/Admin/Changethreatintel#Configure_threat_source_retention\

Proxy Support
As of v. 1.0.4 you can set up a proxy specifically for these feeds. Just modify feed_proxy.conf
Debugging
For detailed logging you can search index=_internal source=""*sa_hlthreatintelligencefeed.log"" which will
tell you if anything goes wrong with either the Scripted Input or Custom Command.
If you use the above search, but see the following: 
[{'type': 'ERROR', 'text': 'Could not find object id=:api_key:', 'code': None}] or a 403 forbidden, and
are upgrading from version 1.0.3 or earlier, then you need to re-enter your API key. 
See the Upgrading section in this README for more information.
Help, I don't see my threatlist!
Once you've configured everything, you should first check to see that your threatlist shows up on the 
""Threat Artifacts"" dashboard in Enterpise Security (Security Intelligence <  Threat Intelligence < Threat Artifacts).
If you do not see your threatlist on the ""Threat Artifacts"" dashboard then it is possible it being omitted as the top
panel specifically (Threat Overview) appends multiple threat intel lists together (file_intel, ip_intel etc.) and
limits the output of those lookups to 10,000 results each. This does not mean your threatlist has not been added.
You can confirm everything is populating as expected by running the following searches:
| inputlookup http_intel | stats count by threat_key
- http_intel will have misp_URLs
| inputlookup ip_intel | stats count by threat_key
- ip_intel will have misp_Domains, and misp_IPDST
| inputlookup file_intel | stats count by threat_key
- file_intelwill have misp_MD5SUMs, misp_SHA1SUMs, and misp_SHA256SUMs
If you still do not see results confirm that the necessary threatintel inputs are enabled in ES:
- Configure < Data Enrichment < Intelligence Downloads

If you are using the 3.4 or 3.4.2 version, an upgrade to 3.4.3 is highly recommended. If you are in Splunk Cloud, kindly read instructions above ""For Splunk Cloud Customers"" to upgrade to this version.
Release Notes for version 3.4.2
This release is a patch to 3.4 and addresses some of the issues discovered since 3.4 release. We also added Splunk recommendations to make 3.4 Splunk Cloud compatible.
Following are some of the key changes introduced in this patch release:
- Implement Splunk best practices for Splunk Cloud compatibility
- Append macro definition for 'Dangerous Domain' in DomainTools Threat Investigation dashboard
- Replace Scripted Inputs with Saved Searches for Cloud compatibility
- Decommissioned Brand Monitor functionality from the App (replaced by DomainTools PhishEye)
Release Notes for DomainTools App for Splunk 3.4

Lastly, the app improves upon its previous versions in optimizing API perfomance in leveraging the latest DomainTools Iris Enrich API. We also addressed numerous bugs and issues reported by our customers.
Release Notes for version 3.3.392
3.3.392 was released to address issues in Splunk Cloud environemnts wrt limited search head functionalities in prior versions. The hotfix addresses the following changes:

Enables domain profile in Splunk Cloud environment
disables top 1 million sites download & filter

The 3.3.39 version of DomainTools TA for Splunk contains performance enhancements that will benefit new users of the app.
Existing users of the DomainTools TA may also benefit from these fixes, especially if they are experiencing specific problems addressed in this build. However, we encourage users who are upgrading to first contact us to understand the changes and anticipate the impact on an existing deployment.

New default domain name search optimized for performance, using the CIM and data model acceleration (DMA). Customers who are not yet using the CIM and DMA will need to customize the search for their environment. More details are available in the DomainTools TA Deployment Guide.
Renamed ""base_search"" macro to ""dt_base_search"" to avoid naming collisions. Existing customers who use the base_search macro in their own custom searches will need to change their searches to use the new macro.
Used more descriptive names for the scheduled searches to more clearly communicate their function, and ensured that only the necessary jobs were enabled.
Performed code cleanup and minor refactoring to ensure compliance with the latest Splunk AppInspect guidelines.
Adjusted permissions on multiple objects to allow non-admin users to utilize more functionality in the app.
Populating the Whois index is now optional as the job is not enabled by default. We recommend enabling the DomainTools Enterprise - Whois Index Populator"" or ""DomainTools Iris - Whois Index Populator"" to enable historical searches for malicious domain names beyond the cache period of the lookups (by default, 30 days).

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5237,2022-01-10,07:30:12 AM,Fuzzylookup,,"Nov. 5, 2021","Fuzzylookup - Splunk App by Deductiv
This app allows you to apply fuzzy logic to lookups from your search result fields for near-matches.  Use cases include:  

Domain analysis (lookalike domains)  
Blacklist similarity  
Typo identification  

Supported Splunk versions: 7.3.x, 8.0.x
Configuration Steps: N/A

Fuzzylookup search command (fuzzylookup)
Syntax:
search | fuzzylookup 
    [ prefix=<string> ]
    [ addmetrics=[True|False] ]
    [ lookupfilter=<kvpairs> ]
    [ mask=<regex> ]
    [ delete=<regex> ]
    <lookup-table-name> 
    ( <lookup-field> [AS <event-field>] ) 
    [ OUTPUT | OUTPUTNEW (<lookup-destfield> [AS <event-destfield>] ) ... ]

Description
Cross-reference your search fields against lookup data for non-exact matches, with the fields from the lookup entry/entries with the best score being appended to the event. 

The Levenstein algorithm (from the jellyfish library) is applied to compute a match score.  
If there are multiple entries with the same score, the tie is broken by how many characters are exact matches.  
If multiple entries still have the same result, the lookup data is added to the event as multivalue fields.  


Lookups can be filtered to limit comparisons with event fields and improve performance. Wildcards are supported.  
Static filters apply for the entire lookup and limit the global dataset being used.  
Dynamic filters take data from each search result into account, and reference event field names.  
The following example contains a static filter followed by a dynamic filter, which references the email_domain field in each event:  




lookupfilter=""LookupField1=\""local admin\"" Lookupfield2=\""*@$email_domain$\""""


Data filtering is supported to limit the number of comparisons being made.  
For example, a email address comparisons can be limited to those where the domains match:  


Text masking and deletion is supported via regex. This masks or deletes the event field data and the lookup data in memory, prior to any comparisons being made.  
Data can be sanitized before comparison to treat certain character classes equally. The following example deletes the domain from an email address, deletes dot (.) and underscore (_), and masks all numbers. 




delete=""(@[^@]+$|\\.|_)"" mask=""[0-9]""

Arguments


Prefix
Syntax: prefix=<prefix_text>
Description: Text to prefix all output field names with. Helpful for applying to every lookup field without aliasing each one.  


Add Metrics
Syntax: addmetrics=[True|False]
Description: Add fuzzy match metrics to each result (score, matching characters, similarity score, consecutive match length).
Default: False


Lookup Filter
Syntax: lookupfilter=""<lookup_field>=\""lookup_value\"" <lookup_field>=\""$event_field$\""""
Description: Filter for data in the specified lookup to reduce the number of comparisons  


Text Masking
Syntax: mask=""<regular expression>""
Description: Mask pattern for both compared sets of values. Masks the regex matched text before comparing.  


Text Deletion
Syntax: delete=""<regular expression>""
Description: Deletion pattern for both compared sets of values. Removes the regex matched text before comparing.  


Standard lookup operators (see Syntax)

Configuration Modeler is a Splunk App which mimics btool, but allows users to select apps or a server class within the deployment server.  The user can select any combination of apps and graphically see the final configuration with a collapsable tree. This tool does not use btool, but instead uses two custom cherrypy endpoint and Splunk's rest search command.
This tool does not take into account any apps or configrations not managed by the deployment server such as those in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local. 
Please report any bugs or incorrect configuration layering with reproduction steps.
Supports:

Distributed Deployment Supported

Requirements


This version has been test on Splunk 6.x


App works on all OS supported by Splunk


Modern browser capable of rendering svg and D3 objects.


Prerequisites


Splunk Deployment Server


Splunk version 6.x or higher


Deployment Server is a search peer of the DMC


Installation instructions
Stand Alone instance
1) copy repo into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ on deployment server.  This assume deployment server webserver enabled.
Distributed environment
This requires the use of Distributed Managment Console (DMC).
1)  copy repo into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ to both the deployment server and DMC.
Note: if you are using an Splunk 6.2.x or earlier you will need to config the override settings within config_modeler.xml. Within the view are comments and descriptions
Debugging
Using jconsole or firebug

Open Config Modeler App within Splunk web.  /en-US/app/config_modeler/config_modeler
In your browser open jconsole.
Enter the following:
 var mvc = require(""splunkjs/mvc"");  // LOADS splunkjs module view controller
 var tokens = mvc.Components.get(""default"");  //GET ALL FORM TOKENS
 console.log(""Deployment Server Name: "" + tokens.get(""dsserver""));  // Name of deployment server
 console.log(""Deployment Server port: "" + tokens.get(""port"")); // Web port 
 console.log(""Deployment Server protocol: "" + tokens.get(""protocol"")); // http or https protocol
 console.log(""Deployment Server API URL: "" + tokens.get(""dsurl"")); // deployment server url

If any of the values are not populated Config modeler will not work, and probably a bug. You can specify token values from config.modeler.xml
##Testing Auto detect searches
 The searches below are used to auto-detect. Verify if searches return data
 Note: replace $dsserver$ with the name of your deployment server

Used to find which server is the depoyment server.  Verify if event is returned.
 |rest /services/server/info | mvexpand server_roles | where server_roles==""deployment_server""
Finds all apps and serverclasses
 | rest splunk_server=$dsserver$ /services/deployment/server/applications | eval serverclasses=if(isnull(serverclasses), ""NA"", serverclasses) | stats count by serverclasses title | fields serverclasses title
Finds httpport of webserver
 | rest splunk_server=$dsserver$ /services/properties/web/settings/httpport
Determines if SSL is enabled on web server
 | rest splunk_server=$dsserver$ /services/properties/web/settings/enableSplunkWebSSL

Additional help documentation is available at https://docs.rapid7.com/insightvm/insightvm-technology-add-on-for-splunk/
Installation
There are two ways to install the technology add-on - via the Splunk app listing, or manually with a provided 
technology add-on package. To install the add-on via the app listing, follow these steps:

From the Apps menu in Splunk, select Manage Apps
Select Browse More Apps
Do a search for the ""Rapid7 InsightVM Technology Add-On""
Select Install from the app listing
Perform a restart of Splunk when prompted

To install the add-on manually, follow these steps:

From the Apps menu in Splunk, select Manage Apps
Select Install app from file
Select the InsightVM Technology Add-On package
Perform a restart of Splunk when prompted

The add-on should now appear as Rapid7 InsightVM under the Apps menu in Splunk.
Configuration
The following details the configuration of the technology add-on in order to perform retrieval and ingestion of
InsightVM data.
Creating a connection
A connection must be created within the add-on to facilitate the retrieval of InsightVM data. This connection utilizes 
a generated Insight platform API key. The following details how to generate a new API key:

Login to the Insight platform here
Select the gear icon on the top menu and click API Keys
Select Organization Key
Select + New Key
Enter a name for the key and click Generate
Copy and securely store the generated key

Once you have an API key, you can configure a connection for the technology add-on in Splunk. To create a connection, 
follow these steps:

Navigate to the Rapid7 InsightVM technology add-on, available under the Apps menu in Splunk
Select Configuration
Select Add
Enter a name for the connection
Enter your region. Additional info on regions is available here
Enter your generated API key
Click Add

Inputs
There are two types of inputs in the technology add-on, and three sourcetypes that result from these inputs. They are:

rapid7:insightvm:asset
rapid7:insightvm:asset:vulnerability_finding
rapid7:insightvm:vulnerability_definition

When configuring the inputs it is important to select the proper index for storing the imported events. The Technology 
Add-On defaults to an index name of rapid7; however, the index is not automatically created. Make sure to either have 
 a Splunk administrator create the rapid7 index or select an index that already exists.
InsightVM Asset Import
The InsightVM Asset Import can be configured to perform an import of two types of data from InsightVM: assets and 
(optionally) vulnerability findings. To configure this input, select Inputs from the technology add-on menu, then 
select InsightVM Asset Import under Create New Input.
The fields for this input are as follows:



Field
Description




Name
The name of the input as it will appear in Splunk


Interval
The frequency in seconds that the import of InsightVM data will occur. Default is once per hour


Index
Your preferred Splunk index for data. Default is rapid7


InsightVM Connection
The InsightVM connection, created as per the instructions in the Configuration section above


Asset Filter
A query for filtering assets that are imported


Import vulnerabilities
An option for whether to import vulnerability findings into Splunk in addition to assets


Vulnerability filter
A query for filtering vulnerability findings that are imported



Here are some example asset filters that can be applied within this input configuration:

sites IN ['site-name']
tags IN ['tag-name']
os_family = 'Windows'

And some example vulnerability filters:

cvss_v2_score > 6
severity = 'Critical'

InsightVM Vulnerability Definition Import
The InsightVM Vulnerability Definition Import is used to import vulnerability definitions from InsightVM. This can be 
used to correlate with vulnerability findings, should you want to import those, as well. This input is not required 
for visualizing asset findings in your environment. However, it does provide additional details about the 
vulnerabilities.
The fields for this input are as follows:



Field
Description




Name
The name of the input as it will appear in Splunk


Interval
The frequency in seconds that the import of InsightVM data will occur. Default is once per day


Index
Your preferred Splunk index for data. Default is rapid7


InsightVM Connection
The InsightVM connection, created as per the instructions in the Configuration section above


Vulnerability filter
A query for filtering vulnerability definitions that are imported



Important Note: Due to the large amount of data contained within vulnerability definitions, we recommend
importing them a maximum of once per day.
Data Visualization
We've also created the Rapid7 InsightVM Dashboard as a starting point for visualizing data that's imported with the 
InsightVM technology add-on. The dashboard can be installed as an app much like the add-on and further customized to 
suit your visualization needs.
FAQs
Does the asset input import all assets each time it is run?
No. When the asset import is run for the very first time, it will default to importing assets that were scanned within 
the past 90 days. After that, all subsequent imports will only pull in assets that have been newly scanned since the 
last import occurred. In other words, if the last import of data occurred on June 5 at 12 PM, then only assets that 
have been scanned between then and now will be imported.
Does the vulnerability definition import input import all definitions each time it is run?
Yes, all vulnerability definitions will be imported each time it is run. For this reason, we recommend running this 
import at a maximum of once per day.
Can I identify whether a vulnerability has been remediated?
Yes, all vulnerability findings will have a finding_status when they are imported into Splunk. Those that are 
remediated will have a finding_status of remediated.
How do I know if a vulnerability is new versus remediated?
Check the finding_status of a vulnerability finding to determine whether it's new, remediated, or unchanged. The 
new and remediated statuses indicate new and remediated vulnerabilities respectively, while the status found 
indicates a previously found, unchanged vulnerability finding.
Why am I not seeing any data in my add-on/dashboard?
Check the selected index and time period for filtering data. These often need to be adjusted to filter correctly 
for assets and vulnerabilities. In addition, if the default rapid7 index was defined for the inputs, make sure this 
input has already been created.

What is AppDynamics?
AppDynamics is an application performance monitoring solution that helps you:
Identify problems such as slow and stalled user requests and errors in a production environment.
Troubleshoot and isolate the root cause of such problems by: 
Mining performance data from AppDynamics and viewing it in Splunk using the AppDynamics Controller REST API. 
Pushing notifications on policy violations and events from AppDynamics to Splunk so that a Splunk user can use those to launch deep dives in AppDynamics. See Getting Notifications From and Launching AppDynamics in Splunk.
Installation
These instructions assume that you are familiar with using both AppDynamics and Splunk. 
Links within this file go to AppDynamics 4.2 documentation. If you are running an earlier version, use the Search feature to find the associated topics.
Prerequisites

You have installed AppDynamics version 4.0 or newer. If you do not already have a license, you can sign up for a trial license. You can choose either a SaaS solution or an On-Premise installation.
You have installed Splunk version 6.x or newer.
You have installed the AppDynamics App for Splunk from Splunkbase. 
You have access to the following AppDynamics Controller information, which is required to set up the integration: 
hostname/IP address
port number
account name
user name

password
If you use a SaaS account, AppDynamics provides you with the required information.
- You have access to the AppDynamics documentation. When you trial or buy the product, AppDynamics provides access credentials to you.
- $SPLUNK_HOME is set to the directory where Splunk is installed.


Steps

Install the appdynamics app from splunkbase and before restarting perform steps 2 and 3.
Locate and edit the files: $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/appdynamics/default/metrics.conf and $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/appdynamics/default/events.conf

In the metrics.conf file, add one section for each individual metric you want to mine from AppDynamics. You need the following:

AppDynamics metric name, to name the section in the metrics.conf file, and for use as as unique identifier in Splunk
REST URL of the metric from the AppDynamics Metric Browser, see the AppDynamics REST documentation  (login required).
polling interval - how frequently, in seconds, Splunk will run the script to get this metric

For example, if you want to mine a metric called AverageResponseTime for the ViewCart.sendItems business transaction, the entry would be similar to this:
[ViewCart.sendItems_AverageResponseTime]  
url = http://<controller-host>:<port>/controller/rest/applications/Acme%20Online%20Book%20Store/metric-data?metricpath=Business%20Transaction%20Performance%7CBusiness%20Transactions%7CECommerce%7CViewCart.sendItems%7CAverage%20Response%20Time%20(ms)&time-range-type=BEFORE_NOW&duration-in-mins=15  
interval = 60



In the events.conf file, add one section for each individual event type you want to mine from AppDynamics. You need the following:

AppDynamics event type, to name the section in the events.conf file, specify the event query for the REST URL, and for use as as unique identifier in Splunk
AppDynamics event severity, to specify the event query for the REST URL
REST URL of the event type from the AppDynamics Metric Browser, see the AppDynamics REST documentation  (login required).
polling interval - how frequently, in seconds, Splunk will run the script to get this metric

For example, if you want to mine events caused by application changes, the entry would look similar to this:
[Server.application_Changes]  
url = http://<controller-host>:<port>/controller/rest/applications/Acme%20Online%20Book%20Store/events?time-range-type=BEFORE_NOW&duration-in-mins=15&event-types=APP_SERVER_RESTART,APPLICATION_CONFIG_CHANGE,APPLICATION_DEPLOYMENT&severities=INFO,WARN,ERROR  
interval = 60



Restart splunk. 

You will be prompted to setup the AppDynamics App. Please click on setup and configure the AppDynamics credentials. Using this view, splunk will store AppDynamics credentials in encrypted mode.
If you want to add more entries to the events.conf or metrics.conf without restarting splunk, please find the python 
processes running for metrics.py and events.py and kill them. It will automatically get restarted and it will pick up the new configurations in the conf files.

Splunk Indexes
For metrics, an index called ""appdynamics"" is created. 
For events, an index called ""appdynamics_events"" is created. 
Metrics

Launch the AppDynamics App in Splunk.
Enter index=appdynamics in the Search field of the AppDynamics App in Splunk.  


Events

Launch the AppDynamics App in Splunk.
Enter index=appdynamics_events in the Search field of the AppDynamics App in Splunk.  


Proxy Support
If the connection to the AppDynamics controller has to go through a proxy, you need to replace the following line
from the metrics.py and events.py 
myhttp = httplib2.Http(timeout=10)
Replace the above line with
myhttp = httplib2.Http(timeout=10,proxy_info = httplib2.ProxyInfo(httplib2.socks.PROXY_TYPE_HTTP, 'localhost', 8000))
Please make sure to replace 'localhost' and 8000 with the correct proxy settings. 
SSL Support
If the connection to the AppDynamics controller is over SSL, you can import the certificates by replacing the following
line from the metrics.py and events.py
myhttp = httplib2.Http(timeout=10)
Replace the above line with 
myhttp = httplib2.Http(timeout=10,ca_certs = '<path_to_certificate>')
Please make sure to replace '<path_to_certificate>' with the correct path in your environment.
Cross App linking to AppDynamics


Add the following field extraction section to your $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/search/default/props.conf file:
[source::http-simple]  
EXTRACT-AppD = url=""http[s]?:\/\/(?<nurl>[^""|]+)""



Add the following workflow action to your $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/search/default/workflow_actions.conf file:
[LaunchAppD]  
display_location = both  
fields = url  
label = Launch in AppDynamics  
link.method = get  
link.target = blank  
link.uri = http://$!nurl$  
type = link

Here, you can explore the evolution of the reference app along with some additional engineering artifacts, like tests, deployment considerations, and tradeoff discussions.
The accompanying Splunk Developer Guide for Building Apps presents a documentary of how the team went about building this reference app. The guide is currently available as a public preview. We welcome your feedback on both the app and the guide.
What Does This App Do?
The PAS app is intended to enable an organization to monitor various document repositories (current and future). Managers and auditors can use the app to see who has viewed, modified, deleted, or downloaded documents or other artifacts from various sources. 
Requirements
Here's what you need to get going with the Splunk Reference App - PAS.
Splunk Enterprise
If you haven't already installed Splunk Enterprise, download it at 
. For more information about installing and 
running Splunk Enterprise and system requirements, see the
Installation Manual. 
The main PAS app
Install or symlink the main app (pas_ref_app) to the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps folder. For linking, use the ln command on Unix/MacOS or the mklink command on Windows.
Getting data in
There are several ways for you to feed data into the PAS app.


Ingest your own data. Just make sure those sources are tagged with ""change"" and ""audit"", 


Use the eventgen app, if you want a simulated data flow. Get it from  (note: it may take several minutes before the events start to be generated), or 


Consume the test data set provided in the test repo. 


Install dependencies
The reference app relies on data provider add-ons. Three simulated data providers (file add-on, documents application add-on, database add-on) and one real data provider (Google Drive Data Provider add-on) are made available. Install at least one data provider. You'll find the install scripts for Unix/MacOS and Windows in the /bin folder. For the Google Drive data provider installation and configuration, see specific instructions in the googledrive_addon/README folder.
The reference app uses a lookup table which could have been produced by an HR system process. For demonstration purposes, we have encapsulated it in the pas_hr_info add-on. 
(Optional) Certain reference app functionality requires an identity provider. We have used a simulated identity provider. 
Configure user access
Create a new user that belongs to the pasadmin or pasuser role, and log in as this new user. 
Alternatively, add index 'pas' to the default searchable indexes by going to Splunk Settings -> Access controls -> Role -> admin -> Indexes searched by default and adding 'pas' into the list of default search indexes.
Note: if you are using a Splunk Free license, integrated role-based access control is not available.Thus, you will not be able to add new users or roles and should use the alternative method of adding the pas to the list of indexes searched by default.
Configure the app using the Setup page
Specify at least one department that you want to surface on the Summary dashboard.
Usage
For usage see the About page of the app.

Single Splunk Search Head
You can either install Perseus directly by clicking the ""Browse for apps"" button on the Manage Apps page, searching for Perseus, and clicking the ""Install"" button. Or you can download Perseus from the Splunkbase and install it by clicking the ""Install app from file"" button on the Manage Apps page.
Splunk Search Head Cluster
To install the Perseus app to a Search Head Cluster, you must use the Deployer. You have three options for how to install Perseus:
1.) Follow the instructions here for deploying a Splunk App with the Deployer: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/DistSearch/PropagateSHCconfigurationchanges
2.) You can download the production version of Perseus (see ""How to Use Perseus"" for more info) which comes with a deployment wizard that automates installation of Perseus into your environment. Please Note: This will install the production version of Perseus that does not come pre-loaded with the case study data.
3.) You may find it easiest to setup a stand-alone Splunk server and follow the ""Single Splunk Search Head"" instructions above. A stand-alone Splunk server can be installed in minutes. You can download a free trial here: https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html 
How to Use Perseus
There are two versions of Perseus. The production version of Perseus allows you to process data from your environment to help you save time investigating incidents. It offers an automated deployment wizard that can install and configure Perseus in under 10 minutes. It comes with a 30 day trial license (60 days if you register) which allows you to process data from an unlimited number of hosts. After that, you can either purchase a license or continue using it for free. if you do not purchase a license, Perseus will be limited to processing data from 50 hosts per day. You can download the production version of Perseus at: https://PerseusSec.com/download-wizard/.
This version of the Perseus is the Perseus Demo. It contains real data from a case study so you can familiarize yourself with Perseus before you collect data from your own environment. While you're welcome to explore it on your own, it's recommended you step through the Perseus Demo Walkthrough to quickly learn about the capabilities of Perseus: https://PerseusSec.com/documentation/perseus-demo-walkthrough/. When you're ready to start using Perseus to help investigate incidents in your environment, download the production version of Perseus at: https://PerseusSec.com/download-wizard/",Version 1.6.5,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/fca1204c-18c7-11eb-aba0-02fa7700cf1c.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance, Utilities",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,749,0,splunk,5,5,Joe Kovacic,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/perseussecurity,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

Ensure your OCI configuration file is complete and the necessary keys have been generated 
Ensure the OCI Logging Addon for Splunk is installed on heavy forwarder, connected, and receiving logs from OCI. 


Create 2 new indexes on indexers. 
First index is where your OCI logs will reside. 
Second index MUST BE named oci_vcn_summary. This is a summary index for VCN Flow Logs. 
All VCN dashboards rely on this summary index. 
Use below sample to deploy on cluster master and do cluster bundle push:



[oci_vcn_summary] 
homePath = $SPLUNK_DB/oci_vcn_summary/db 
coldPath = $SPLUNK_DB/oci_vcn_summary/colddb 
thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/oci_vcn_summary/thaweddb 
coldToFrozenDir = $SPLUNK_DB/oci_vcn_summary/frozendb 
##### 30 days 
frozenTimePeriodInSecs = 2592000 
maxHotIdleSecs = 3600 
repFactor = auto 



Deploy OCI app on Search Head or deployer and push out to SHC
Deploy OCI log streaming add-on on a Splunk 8.0+ Heavy Forwarder, since it relies on Python 3.x
Add inputs through the add-on user interface (on heavy forwarder)
On search head with this app deployed, edit macros,
Update the 'oci_index` macro with the 1st index created above
Once OCI log streaming data is flowing to your Splunk instance, run the save searched ending with 'RUN ONCE' to initially populate necessary lookups
Watch dashboards get populated

NOTES ON MACROS PROVIDED IN THIS APP: 
oci_index : update with index where your OCI logs are sent 
oci_trim : this macro renames multiple nested json trees and creates new fields that all dashboards rely on. Use within your search as such: 
VALID SEARCHES:
VALID: `oci_index` sourcetype=com.oraclecloud.object* `oci_trim`
VALID: `oci_index` `oci_trim` | search type=object*  
VALID: `oci_index` `oci_trim` 
INVALID SEARCH: 
INVALID: `oci_index` `oci_trim` sourcetype=com.oraclecloud.object* 
Notes on saved searches provided in this app: 
This app contained 3 backfill searches. USE THESE SEARCHES WITH CAUTION!!!

Atlas Scheduling Assistant is a powerful tool that can help you optimize and maintain the performance of your Splunk environment. Scheduled searches running concurrently can quickly use up the resources your Splunk environment needs to serve your Splunk users. This means that as your Splunk environment grows you are becoming more likely to encounter this problem. Without proper guidance and tooling this problem can very difficult to solve manually and can take hours of trial and error to get it right. Scheduling Assistant seeks to make this problem easy to identify and resolve.
How to Use Scheduling Assistant
1. Monitor the health of your Scheduler by watching the health score provided by Scheduling Assistant.
2. When a problem is identified, use Scheduling Assistants investigation tools to identify where the problems are.
3. Once you have identified the problems, use Scheduling Assistants modeling tool to determine how changing a scheduled search will improve your Splunk environment.
4. Once you have modeled the changes to correct the seach concurrency, you can implement the scheduling change in your Splunk environment with one click.
5. Continue to monitor your Splunk environment for unhealthy search concurrency regularly using Scheduling Assistants Health Score
Key Features
- Proactively monitors Scheduler health in your Splunk environment and displays a simple health score so that it can be easily monitored.
- Quickly identify where search concurrency exists.
- Model the changes to see if changing a scheduled search will improve your environment.
- Implement schedule changes in Splunk automatically with a click of a button.
- Compatible with both Splunk Enterprise on-premise and Splunk Cloud!",,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/817eb684-da8e-11eb-ac1f-0a4d0a96e15d.png,Utilities,,10,0,splunk,5,10,Kinney Group,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/atlasproductteam,

For more information about this solution refer to the Cisco Endpoint Security Analytics for Splunk (CESA) home page.

GETTING STARTED
Cisco Endpoint Security Analytics for Splunk (CESA) consists of 3 components:

The Splunk App - 2992 with pre-designed Dashboards to visualize and view the data.
The Splunk Add-on - 4221 which provides data indexing and formatting inside Splunk Enterprise.
The CESA Collector Component which is responsible for collecting and translating all IPFIX (nvzFlow) data from the endpoints and forwarding it to the Splunk Add-on.  This is a manually installed component that requires 64-bit Linux (see NVM COLLECTOR COMPONENT INSTALLATION section for more information).


DEPLOYMENT OVERVIEW
Below is a high level overview of a deployment in its simplest form.
This would be an all-in-one configuration running on 64-bit Linux. 
This configuration is how most demonstrations will be setup and is also useful in a small production deployment.

Below is a more comprehensive set of options that are available for deployment.
Typically a production setup will be distributed and have several Splunk Enterprise nodes.


SPLUNK APPLICATION & ADD-ON INSTALLATION
The Application should be installed on the Search Head or Indexer, either through the UI via “Manage Apps” or by extracting the archive into /opt/splunk/etc/apps folder.  
The Splunk Add-on should be installed following the Splunk Best Practices Instructions for Add-ons
Please restart the Spunk Server after installation of both components is completed.
You can confirm that both components are properly installed by viewing them in ""Manage Apps""

After completing this step, refer to the NVM collector installation section below.  The collector must be running before data will be available to the Splunk components.
The default configuration receives three data feeds for Splunk, Per Flow Data, Endpoint System Data and Endpoint Interface Data, on UDP ports 20519, 20520 and 20521 respectively.  This can be changed in the Application Input settings in Splunk if for some reason you needed to change the collector configuration as described below.
The Add-On maps these to Splunk sourcetypes cisco:nvm:flowdata, cisco:nvm:sysdata and cisco:nvm:ifdata.
NOTE: Because sourcetypes have changed older data generated from version 1.x will not map to the UI dashboards.

NVM COLLECTOR COMPONENT INSTALLATION
The NVM collector runs on 64-bit Linux.  CentOS, Ubuntu and Docker configuration scripts are included.  The CentOS install scripts and configuration files can also be used in Fedora and Redhat distributions.
In a typical distrubuted Splunk Enterprise deployment, the collector should be run on either a standalone 64-bit Linux system or a Splunk Forwarder node running on 64-bit Linux.
NOTE: The solution can also be run on a single 64-bit Linux system that includes the NVM collector and Splunk Enterprise components for use in a small deployment or for demonstration purposes.
In order to install the collector you will need to copy the application in the acnvmcollector.zip file, located in the [YOUR_SPLUNK_SERVER]/$APP_DIR$/appserver/addon/ directory to the system you plan to install it on. 
Extract the files on the system where you plan to install the collector on and execute the install.sh script with super user privileges.  It is recommended to read the $PLATFORM$_README file in the .zip bundle before executing the install.sh script.  The $PLATFORM$_README file provides information on the relevant configuration settings that need to be verified and modified (if necessary) before the install.sh script is executed.  At a minimum, you will need to configure the address of the Splunk instance you will be forwarding data to.  Failing to properly configure the system can cause the collector to operate incorrectly.
NOTE: Ensure that network and host firewalls are properly configured to allow the UDP traffic for the source and destination addresses and ports
A single NVM collector instance can handle a minimum of 5000 flows per second on a properly sized system.
The collector needs to be configured and running before the Splunk App can be used.
By default, the collector receives flows from AnyConnect NVM endpoints on UDP port 2055.
Additionally, the collector produces three data feeds for Splunk,  Per Flow Data,  Endpoint System Data and  Endpoint Interface Data, on UDP ports 20519, 20520 and 20521 respectively.
The receive and data feed ports can be changed by altering the acnvm.conf file and restarting the collector instance.  Make sure that any host/network firewalls between endpoints and the collector or between the collector and Splunk system(s) are open for the configured UDP ports and addresses.  Also ensure that your AnyConnect NVM configuration matches your collector configuration.  Refer to the AnyConnect Administration Guide for more information.
Once all components are installed and running, refer to the Help files section from within the Splunk application for detailed information about the pre-configured reports, data model and information elements that are created by the solution.
You may want to restart one of your AnyConnect endpoints and validate that data is being sent to the solution.
Some additional information is available at this Cisco Community Site that you might find useful.

SPLUNK ENTERPRISE
* The Pulse Technology Add-on will work with Splunk Enterprise 6.4 and later. If you are not on at least 6.4, you should consult the Splunk knowledgebase for instructions and guidance on upgrading your installation.
PULSE
 Contact support@pwnieexpress.com to get a copy of your API keys before you get started
 Ensure applicable services such as real-time wireless, blue-hydra and/or pwnscan are enabled and configured. Without these, the API will have no data to reference. For help on completing these tasks, please consult the Pulse User Guide 
INSTALLATION


Download the Pwnie Express Technology-Add on from the Splunkbase app store here: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3725


In Splunk, select Apps → Manage Apps, then “Install app from file”. 


Choose the file you downloaded in Step 1. 
   Note: You will need to restart Splunk to complete the installation process.


Select Configuration → Add-on Settings and input your valid PwnPulse API credentials;


Your API URL may vary depending on your region. The default is api.pwnieexpress.net. When complete, click ‘Save’. 
   Note: You may optionally adjust logging verbosity for troubleshooting/debugging purposes.


INPUTS
If you’ve successfully installed the Pulse Technology Add-On, the default inputs will be enabled.
HISTORICAL DATA FETCHING
By default the TA will download the past 7 days of historical data and index it into Splunk. The initial import can take time, but after that, only new changes are fetched.
  SOURCE TYPES
The add-on creates several new source types in Splunk. These provide easy-access to Pulse data in search and is helpful to distinguish which API endpoint was utilized. See Appendix 1 for a listing of available fields for each of these endpoints
Wireless Clients
    pulse:wireless_clients
    /v1/clients
Access Points
    pulse:wap
         /v1/access-points
Bluetooth
    pulse:bluetooth_devices
         /v1/bluetooth-devices
Network Hosts
    pulse:network_hosts
         /v1/network-hosts
Scripts
    pulse:scripts
         /v1/scripts
Task Schedules
    pulse:tasks
         /v1/task-schedules
Alerts
    pulse:alerts
         /v1/alerts
Threats
    pulse:threats
         /v1/threats
SEARCH AND DASHBOARDS


After your data is indexed in splunk, you should begin seeing the default dashboard populate.
The default dashboard is constructed with a few example searches, these are intended to help you construct meaningful displays relevant to your environment. 
The TA is configured to place API data in the default index. In our examples, that index is ‘main’. Your default index name may vary, you will have to adjust your searches accordingly.  
NETWORK HOSTS
Count the number of online/active network hosts across all sensors:
index=""main"" ""attributes.status""=online sourcetype=""pulse:network_hosts"" | stats count by attributes.mac | stats count
WIRELESS CLIENTS
Count the number of online/active wireless clients across all sensors:
index=""main"" ""attributes.status""=online sourcetype=""pulse:wireless_clients""  | dedup attributes.mac | stats count by attributes.mac| stats count
WIRELESS ACCESS POINTS
Count the number of online/active wireless access points across all sensors:
index=""main"" ""attributes.status""=online sourcetype=""pulse:wap""  | stats count by attributes.bssid | dedup attributes.bssid | stats count
BLUETOOTH DEVICES
Count the number of online/active bluetooth devices across all sensors:
index=main AND sourcetype=""pulse:bluetooth_devices"" AND attributes.status=online | dedup attributes.address | stats count
ALERTS
See the top 20 alerts across your pulse environments (defaults to last 24 hours):
index=""main"" sourcetype=""pulse:alerts"" | top limit=20 ""attributes.rule-name""
THREATS
See the top 20 threats across your pulse environments (defaults to last 24 hours):
index=main sourcetype=pulse:threats ""attributes.active""=true | top limit=20 ""attributes.description""
TROUBLESHOOTING
COMMON PITFALLS


Network Time Protocol (NTP) is out of sync.
        Solution: Run ntpdate or start the ntpd service on your Splunk server.


Invalid API URL 
        Solution: Check that your API URL is correct.


Invalid API credentials.
        Solution: Check that your API credentials are correct.


LOG LOCATIONS


/opt/splunk/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log
The default Splunk server log. May vary according to your implementation.      
Typically, any errors that may occur will be captured in this file.


/opt/splunk/var/log/splunk/ta_pulse_pwnpulse_api.log
This is the PwnPulse TA log. You can watch this file to monitor TA API calls in real-time.
        Tailing this file will be helpful in troubleshooting, should you encounter any issues.

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5175,2022-01-10,07:31:29 AM,Polar Add-On for Splunk,,"Dec. 11, 2020","Summary
Use this add-on to import Polar exercises, daily activities and physical information.
It uses distinct source types for each type:

polar:activity for activity data, e.g. daily steps and daily calories.
polar:exercise for exercise summary data.
polar:exercise:tcx for the detailed exercise data.
polar:physical for physical information, like weight, resting heart rate and VO2max.
polar:recharge for nightly recharge data.
polar:sleep for sleep data.

Requirements

This add-on uses Python 3 and will only work on Splunk Enterprise 8.x or newer.

Usage

Install the Polar Add-On for Splunk.
Create a new Polar input, by going to Settings -> Data Inputs -> Polar. By default it runs once every day (86400 seconds).
Get the access token and your Polar user ID by visiting the URL at the top, paste the values in the input.
If you made a mistake, please delete the input and create a new one with a different name.

Normalisation
The following sourcetypes capture their main metric as follows to normalise data across other apps from the same author, e.g. Fitness App for Splunk:

polar:sleep - sleepDuration
polar:activity - steps

Known caveats

For some data types (e.g. exercise), Polar currently does not include timezone data and only has a timestamp local to the device. A request has been made to Polar to include this data in a future version of the API.
Polar's API does not expose the activity id of the exercise, so it's not possible to correlate this directly to a Polar Flow URL.
Once exercise or activity data is retrieved, there is no way to retrieve that data again due to the way the Polar API works. This should not matter, unless you have multiple Splunk instances with the Polar Add-On for Splunk getting data for the same Polar user account.

Troubleshooting

If you want to start over, delete the input and create a new one with a different name and reauthenticate using the URL at the top.

Version 1.0
The Minecraft App lets you visualize the minecraft world from the guts side. Wondering how many blocks have been dug up by your buddies? Not a problem. Wondering who's found the most diamonds? Yep, got it covered. Have you been planting enough wheat? Carrots? Pototoes? The Minecraft App will let you know.
Release Notes

Uses the new Splunk HTTP Event Collector as it's input instead of TCP.
Now supports Spigot and Forge as well as Craftbukkit as a unified plugin jar.
Plugin will cache items that the server does not acknowledge so restarting Splunk is no longer an issue
Ore images in the ""Mined Blocks"" page of the app now display correctly.
Minor bug fixes.

Getting Started
This section provides information about installing and using the Minecraft App. 
Requirements

Operating System: Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X.
Web browsers: Latest versions of Chrome, Safari, or Firefox, Internet Explorer 9 or later. 
Craftbukkit, Spigot or Forge
Craftbukkit
Spigot
Forge
LogToSplunk Plugin: The log to splunk plugin that allows input of more detailed minecraft data to splunk from CraftBukkit
The Splunk Web Framework: The Web Framework is included in Splunk 6 and is available for download for Splunk 5 from the 
Splunk Developer Portal.
Minecraft Overviewer (Optional): The Google Maps based minecraft word renderer from Overviewer

Installing the Minecraft App
The Minecraft App is built as a Splunk App on the Splunk Web Framework and must be installed on top of it. 
Installing from Splunk Web
If you downloaded the Minecraft App from Splunk Apps, you can install the app within Splunk Web. 

For more, see Where to get more apps and add-ons.

Installing from a ZIP Source File

Download and unzip the Minecraft App 
or clone the repository from GitHub. 
Copy the entire /minecraft-app subdirectory into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/. 
Restart Splunk.
In Splunk Web, navigate to the Minecraft App (http://localhost:8000/dj/minecraft-app).

Event Collector Configuration

Confgiure the Splunk Http Event Collector as noted in the Documentation for whatever port you like.
Ensure firewalls and NAT are properly configured if applicable
Take note of the application key as you will need it later on

Installing the LogToSplunk Plugin

Copy the LogToSplunk jar from the app tgz or app directory into your craftbukkit server's plugins directory.
Create a config directory in the root server folder (the directory that contains the plugins folder).
Create and edit a splunk.properties text file in the config directory created in 3. Replace the port and application in your splunk.properties and adjust other options as necessary.



Use the app token from the Event Collector Configuration above for this property splunk.craft.token=BEEFCAFE-1337-F00D-8BDA-2410D44E3453


If you're running splunk on a separate machine from your minecraft server update this property splunk.craft.connection.host=127.0.0.1


Use the app token from the Event Collector Configuration above for this property splunk.craft.connection.port=8088


If you wish to log the output to a local log as well set this property to ""true"" mod.splunk.enable.consolelog=false


Configuring The Livemap

Download and configure Overview as described int the Overviewer Docs
Serve the overviewer via a webserver like Apache or IIS. Many operating systems have a web service built in that just needs to be enabled.
Create an initial render from overviewer with at least one of the ""Normal"",""Lighting"", and ""Night"" options
Copy the overviewer.css,overviewer.js, and overviewerConfig.js scripts from the base render directory to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/minecraft-app/django/minecraft-app/static/minecraft-app/ on your splunk server.
Edit $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/minecraft-app/django/minecraft-app/static/minecraft-app/overviewerConfig.js and modify the path variable of each tileset object to include your webserver path. For example, change ""path"": ""world-normal"" to ""path"": ""http://webserver:81/world-normal"". The external hostname must be used in order for the map to be visible to clients. Using ""localhost"" as the webserver will not work as the minecraft app does not reserve the map, it simply redirects to it.

NOTE: The minecraft-app does not refresh overviewer renders automatically. This will need to be scheduled by another service (ie. cron or task scheduler).
Known Issues
1) Time calculations and active players may be mis-reported if player disconnects are not logged properly (ie. due to a server crash). Orphaned sessions may be estimated by running sessions from connection to the subsequent server start.
2) The live map may appear to ""shift"" as the minecraft world expands and overviewer resets it's origin in future renders. This can be corrected by recopying and modifying the overviewerConfig.js script with the same steps as the installation.
Documentation and resources
When you need to know more:

App to monitor and parse Splunk configuration files.
To run this App, install the specific App_Splunk-ConfVersion Add-on to monitor and parse Splunk configuration changes on each Splunk Server.
This App is specific adapted for Splunk Enterprise Servers running in cluster mode.
The best way to get the results is to install this app in the same Search Head you installed the DMC Console.
Installation and configuration
Splunk Components
This App should be installed on your DMC console or Splunk DMC server.
It comes bundled with important KOs for viewing the indexed configuration data. 
Configuration

Note: The app in this repo comes pre-configured with files in default/.
You can use local/*.conf files in this repo as templates to cofngiure the app in your environment.

How to use the app
Just install the App after the installation and configuration or the TA-Confversion.
Ensure that the index=splunk_confchange is created and the macros.conf in the TA-Confversion are working.
If you change the index name, then you'll maybe have to change it in some dashboards.
Requirements and Dependencies
There are some points to concern before you start with the app.
Remember to follow the instructions explained below.
Install TA_Splunk-ConfVersion before
to use this App you need first to install the TA-Confversion.
You can download the ""all in one"" package under: - https://github.com/Splunk-App-and-TA-development/Splunk_ConfVersion_App-and-TA
follow the setup instructions once the TA-Confversion is installed and restart then your Splunk instance.
Adapt the Timeline Visualization XML on Dashboards
To run the App, you need to ensure that the timeline visualization is installed.
Download direct from Splunk: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3120/
The best way is to install the Splunk-TA Common-viz which contains a big collection of visualizations in one TA.
Download and install it from Github: https://github.com/Splunk-App-and-TA-development/Splunk_TA_common-viz
You need to adapt the path of the visualization in the dashboard named configuration_change_statistics.xml if you install the timeline viz from splunkbase.com.

Security
This TA exposes potentially sensitive information to users.
This includes any passwords/tokens/usernames contained within conf files on the instance.
We highly recommended to allow the access soley to administrators to index this TA uses to prevent information disclousre to unauthorised parties. 
The installation of this Addon can cause added load on the Splunk systems. Ensure you are comfortable with that before implementing this change.

Overview
Many organizations is IDS/IPS devices and software as their first line of defense against attackers. This app provides Splunk dashboards, forms, and reports which can be used to explore your IDS events across your different sourcetypes.
To do this, the app relies on the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) for IDS attack events. This means that the app can report on any intrusion data, as long as it has been on-boarded properly, and is available through the Intrusion Detection data model, including network, host, wireless, and application products.
A note on Splunk Data Model Acceleration and Disk Space
This app requires data model acceleration, which will use additional disk space. If you are using the Splunk App for Enterprise Security, this is already enabled, and should have been factored into your retention policies. If not, you should review the documentation on data model acceleration, how it uses disk space, and how to plan for it.
A note on the Splunk Common Information Model
As mentioned above, the app uses the CIM for intrusion events. The CIM allows you to take events from a number of sources or products, and report on them in one cohesive manner, using a common set of names for fields and event types.
Available Dashboards
Overview
Provides a starting point for exploring your IDS events. Most panels will drill-down to other pages in the application.
Attack Source Profile
A view based on the source of IDS events.
Attack Destination Profile
IDS events where attacks are launched against the same destination.
Attack Signature Profile
Panels which focus on events which all are from the same identified with the same signature.
Attack Category Profile
A view focusing on attacks which fall into the same category (as defined in the events).
Attack Search
A form for finding events based on various field values.
Sourcetypes (Advanced)
Information about the sourcetypes which are present in the accelerated data.
Prerequisites
Splunk Versions
This app has been tested with Splunk versions 7.0 and 7.1. This app should be installed on the same search head on which the |data_model| data model has been accelerated.
Splunk Common Information Model Add-on
This app depends on data models included in the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on, specifically the |data_model| data model. Please review the information on installing and using the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on and information on configuring the acceleration on the data model.
The Splunk Common Information Model Add-on can be downloaded from Splunkbase.
This app has been tested with versions 4.9 of the CIM add-on.
Data model Acceleration on the Intrusion data model
In order to make the app respond and load quickly, accelerated data models are used to provide summary data. For this data to be available, the |data_model| data model must be accelerated. Information on how to enable acceleration for the |data_model| data model can be found here. The data model must be accelerated for the length of time for which you would like to see reporting.
Installation
This app should be installed on a search head where the |data_model| data model has been accelerated. More information on installing or upgrading Splunk apps can be found here.
Simple Installation Process

Make sure the field extractions and tags on your intrusion events are correct.
Install the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on (skip if you are installing on an ES search head).
Install the Aplura Intrusion App for Splunk for Splunk.
Enable accelerations on the |data_model| data model (skip if you are installing on an ES search head).
Wait for the accelerations to start. After the acceleration searches have run, you should start seeing the dashboards populate.

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4323,2022-01-10,07:32:23 AM,PyDen Manager,,"June 11, 2020","Overview
The goal of this application is to provide full Python functionality to Splunk. Currently, the Python distribution built in to Splunk runs on a version 2.7.x depending on the Splunk version. Additionally, there are significant core modules that are excluded in this distribution. This suite of apps will allow developers to create Python virtual environments and pick the Python version and modules installed to the environment. This includes core distributions of the interpreter in multiple 2.7.x and 3.5+ versions, as well as the use of pip for the installation of additional modules within a virtual environment.
Why PyDen
Introduction
The PyDen app is based on the premise that the Splunk built-in CPython distribution is insufficient for advanced development within the Splunk platform. The key example of this is Splunk's own Machine Learning toolkit (MLTK). The Splunk MLTK requires the installation of an add-on which provides access to the Anaconda Python interpreter and several Python libraries that are common in the community for Machine Learning applications, such as numpy. 
While this is an excellent solution for providing the needed functionality for the MLTK, it's insufficient for generalized use for three reasons. These are the three primary concerns  that PyDen attempts to address: version flexibility, proper isolation, and access to PyPI packages.
Version flexibility
Splunk's built-in Python utilizes version 2.7 of CPython. While there are a decent number of common libraries that are continuing support of 2.7, the number is dwindling and  newer projects do not support it at all. The version will also reach end of life in 2020, causing significant supportability and security issues. The PyDen app allows a developer to build CPython from source in a variety of versions including 3.5 and higher through the use of the createdist command.
Development isolation
Modules added to a Splunk app are available to the entire installation, which is in contrast to Python development best practices which calls for the isolation of package requirements through the use of virtual environments. This isolation of packages resolves issues around dependency conflicts and keeps the scope of libraries to the context of the application. This is done through making Python virtual environments available via PyDen's createvenv command.
Leveraging libraries
Splunk does not allow a developer to add additional packages not included with the built-in distribution except through inclusion within the app directly. Ease of inclusion of third-party libraries is a key benefit of Python. However, including non-native libraries within a Splunk application poses two key challenges: dependency chasing and library conflicts (which we discuss in the next section). In order to include a non-native library within a Splunk app, a developer must include it directly within the app's bin directory. If the package contains any dependencies, those must be added as well. If any of the dependencies have their own dependencies, they must be included as well. And so on, and so on. By creating access to the pip command within Splunk, PyDen does not suffer this problem.
Architecture
PyDen is broken into two separate Splunk apps called: PyDen and PyDen Manager. The PyDen Manager app contains all the functionality needed for a user to download, compile, and build Python distributions and virtual environments, as well as the ability to use pip to install packages to those environments. The actual CPython builds and environments are placed in the PyDen app. The location of the PyDen app can vary depending on the Splunk architecture. 
For a single search head environment the PyDen app can be placed along side the PyDen Manager in the Splunk apps directory. 
In a deployment with multiple search heads, PyDen can be placed onto the deployment server repository location. 
In a deployment utilizing search head clustering, it can be placed into the deployer's shcluster/apps directory. 
In all of these scenarios, PyDen Mnagaer must be installed to the same host as PyDen. The pyden.conf configuration file inside of the PyDen Manager app contains a stanza called app which has a location attribute which should specific the absolute path of the PyDen app. 
Compatibility
The PyDen suite of apps has been tested for compatibility with Splunk 7.2. Use with other version of Splunk are considered experimental and should be tested thoroughly. 
Requirements
The app builds CPython from source and therefore the success of the build is highly dependent on the operating system libraries available. The host OS must have a compiler and the packages needed in order to build Python from source. Please refer to the documentation for your OS for needed packages. Two options are included in the ./configure command during the Python build process: --enable-optimizations (if configured) and --with-ensurepip=install.
Installation and Configuration
Installation of the PyDen Manager follows the same process as any other Splunk app. Please refer to Splunk's documentation on the subject. The PyDen app installation process will vary depending on the Splunk deployment architecture. Please see the Architecture section for details on where to install PyDen. If PyDen is installed to any location other than the Splunk apps directory, the installation process will consist of extracting the app from the gzipped tarball and placing it in the specified directory on the host.
Both PyDen and PyDen Manager need to be installed on the same host. After both apps are installed, the PyDen Manager needs to be configured through the pyden.conf file. This file contains two stanzas: download and app. The download stanza has a single attribute called url which is used to specify the location from where Python is downloaded. It is not recommended to change this location except in the need to app proxy information. If a location other than www.python.org there will be significant gaps in the functionality of the dashboards. The app stanza contains two attributes optimize and location. The location attribute is the absolute path of the location of the PyDen app and the optimize attribute is a boolean which indicates whether or not Python will be built using the --enable-optimizations parameter. Enabling optimizations will provide significant speed improvements but takes significantly longer to build. 
Custom Commands
There are three primary custom commands that make up the core functionality of PyDen: createdist, createvenv, and pip. There are additional suplemental commands that primarily aid in working with the dashboards.
Createdist
The createdist command is how PyDen downloads and builds a CPython distribution. This command contains two keyword arguments version and download. The version argument is simply the version number of the Python installation to be built. The download argument is optional and only used if not doing an automatic download from www.python.org. Instead of being downloaded, the Python source package can be placed inside the PyDen Manager's bin/build directory. When done this way, the download argument should provide the name of the package to be used. Package must be a file of .tgz format.
Note: the first distribution created by this command will be set as the default version used by other commands like createvenv.
Examples:
Download and install version 3.7.2 from www.python.org
| createdist version=3.7.2
Install 3.7.2 version of Python from source package called mypython.tgz
| createdist version=3.7.2 download=mypython.tgz
Createvenv
The createvenv command creates a Python virtual environment with a specified version and name. The command has two required keyword arguments: version and name. The version is a version number that references an installed Python distribution from the createdist command. The name argument is a name to be associated with the environment for future reference.
Note: the first environment created by this command will be set as the default environment used by other commands like pip.
Examples:
Create a virtual environment with Python version 3.7.2 and named mypy
| createvenv version=3.7.2 name=mypy
Pip
The pip command installs Python packages available from the Python Package Index. This command works identically to the command-line tool of the same name with one exception. The command takes a single keyword argument called environment which specifies which virtual environment the command applies to. If used, this must be the first argument listed. If not used, the command will apply to the default virtual environment.
Examples:
Install the package requests to the default environment
| pip install requests
Upgrade the pip version of the environment myvenv
| pip environment=myvenv install --upgrade pip
Additional Commands
The following commands are included in the PyDen Manager app but are of limited value. They're typically used to provide some needed functionality for a dashboard. 
Getversions
This command creates a list of events with a field called version whose values are PyDen compatible versions of Python available from www.python.org.
Example:
| getversions
Pydelete
This command deletes distributions and virtual environments created through the createdist and createvenv commands. The command takes a single positional argument of the name or version number of the environment or distribution to be deleted.
Examples:
Delete the 3.7.2 distribution
| pydelete 3.7.2
Delete the virtual environment named mypy
| pydelete mypy
Getvenvs
This command creates a set of events with a single field called environment whose values are the names of virtual environments created by the createvenv command.
Example:
| getvenvs
Getpackages
The getpackages command is used to get package information from the Python Package Index. There are two modes to this command. The command itself takes a single positional argument. If pypi_simple_index is provided as the argument then the command will create a set of events with a single field called package whose value is the name of a package from PyPI's simple index.
If any other argument is provided, the command will use its other mode which looks up the json data for a PyPI package found at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/package_name/json and returns an event with a single field called description whose value is the PyPI description of the package provided.
Examples:
Get all PyPI packages from the PyPI simple index
| getpackages pypi_simple_index
Get the description for the requests package
| getpackages requests
Using virtual environments
Leveraging the environments in the PyDen app is simply a matter of importing the activation modules provided with PyDen.
PyDen comes with two scripts in its bin directory: activate.py and  activate_default.py. The activate.py script contains a function called activate_venv_or_die. In order to run a script with a PyDen virtual environment, the script must include the following code at the top, substituting your virtual environment name for environment_name:
from activate import activate_venv_or_die
activate_venv_or_die(""environment_name"")
This will utilize Python's os.execve function to restart the script with the provided virtual environment. 
While this will work with any valid virtual environment provided, you may not wish to muddy up your import statements with functions. In order to avoid this problem the activate_default.py script is provided. This script will activate the default virtual environment defined in the PyDen app's pyden.conf configuration file when imported and without the function call. Instead of the above code, simply add the following code to the top of your script:
import activate_default
It is important to note that these two scripts are included in the PyDen app and in order to import them as Python modules, you will need to do one of the following:
- Place the script you are writing in the PyDen bin directory (this is highly discouraged as scripts can be overwritten during an upgrade of the app)
- Modify the sys.path to include the PyDen bin directory before importing the scripts (this may have unintended side effects)
- Copy activate.py and activate_default.py files into the app which contains your script (preferred method)",Version 1.3.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/dbe566be-ab95-11ea-8f00-0281150c11dc.png,Utilities,https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,801,0,splunk,5,1,Jason Rauen,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/badarsebard,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

The CheckPoint Block Alert Action for Splunk allows organizations to easily block suspicious IPs on their CheckPoint systems. The app includes an adaptive response action and a workflow action.
Release notes
Version 2.0.1 is the fifth release. It contains a bug fix to the alert action. This update is only compatible with Splunk 8+/Python 3. Version 1.0.2 contains an update to the README file. Version 1.0.1 contains minor edits to version 1.0.0. SSL verification of the API call to the management server is disabled because most servers either have self signed or non-existant certificates. You will also need to have a configured CheckPoint firewall for this app to function (it's in the name, so you're probably aware of this already).
About this release
Version 2.0.1 of the CheckPoint Block Alert Action For Splunk is compatible with:



Splunk Enterprise versions
8.0, 8.1, 8.2




Platforms
Platform independent


Vendor Products
CheckPoint Management API, CheckPoint R80, R80.10, R81.x


Lookup file changes
None



Prerequisites and Requirements
This app requires that the CheckPoint management server controlling gateways be running a version which supports the R80.x and R81.x web API. Standalone gateways are supported in addition to management servers handling multiple gateways. Gateways do not necessarily need to be running a version running the API if they are centrally managed by a management server which supports the API. By default, the app will issue a block command to all managed gateways. 
The CheckPoint API must be configured to allow remote connections in order for this to operate; the management API doesn’t allow remote access by default. To enable API access, open SmartConsole and navigate to Manage and Settings -> Blades -> Management API -> Advanced Settings. If this setting is changed, you will need to restart the API by SSHing into the management server and running the api restart command.

The workflow action will show up as ""(Non-IR) Issue a block command of IP: (selected IP here) to configured Check Point system""
The included workflow action allows you to block specific IPs returned when you run a search.
These are global and are therefore available across all apps.
The following workflows are available. Wildcards are used to match any field containing a specific term such as domain:
execute_check_point_block
The user should check their management server to view blocks executed with the workflow action

Known Issue

The workflow action cannot be used in ES Incident Review. The (Non-IR) appearing before the action is meant to bring this greater visibility. 
Unfortunately, there is no way to disable the action from appearing in Incident Review.",Version 2.0.1,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/b92db480-5230-11ec-bd45-6ebf1e056a1a.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,471,0,splunk,0,0,Hurricane Labs,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/hurricanelabs,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

Email continues to be the most widely used attack vector. Data sourced from email activity and attacks is high value 
 Impersonation Protect Dashboard

The Impersonation Protect dashboard gives you an at-a-glance view of the types of phishing techniques targeting your organization and who is most at risk.

Attachment Protect Dashboard

Use the Attachment Protect Dashboard to view and investigate targeted malware attacks detected by Mimecast.

URL Protect Dashboard

Use the URL Protect Dashboard to gain insights into malicous or suspicious links clicked in emails.
Key Capabilities and Benefits

Analyze logs from your Mimecast tenant in isolation using Splunk Enterprise's powerful search capability
Correlate logs from your Mimecast tenant with data from other security systems to provide more context and actionable information
Stay informed with out-of-the-box dashboards or by creating custom reports and alerts tailored to your organization's needs
Track user activty and system changes in Mimecast and correlate this with data from other systems
Leverage data to demonstrate regulatory compliance

Solution Overview


Mimecast logs event activity in real time. This includes email receipt, processing and delivery, and employees clicking on links within an email.
The events are then made available for integration into 3rd party systems via a REST API using industry standard JSON or pipe delimited, key-value pair formats.
Log collection is achieved using modular inputs. For the greatest flexibility, each log type is separated into its own input, allowing you to choose what data you want to ingest.
With modular inputs successfully configured, data is immediately ingested and indexed by Splunk Enterprise. Once indexed, data is searchable and displayed in the app's built in dashboards.

TROUBLESHOOTING
General Checks

To troubleshoot Lansweeper Add-on For Splunk, check $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/Splunk/ta_lansweeper*.log or user can search index=""_internal"" source=*ta_lansweeper*.log query to see all the logs in UI. Also, user can use index=""_internal"" source=*ta_lansweeper*.log ERROR query to see ERROR logs in the Splunk UI.
Note that all log files of this Add-on will be generated in the $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/Splunk/ directory.
App icons are not showing up: The Add-on does not require a restart after the installation for all functionalities to work. However, the icons will be visible after one Splunk restart post-installation.
After updating fields for workflow actions in the Add-on Settings page, open a new tab or clear the browser cache to reflect the changes.

Correlation

Check that the correlation searches are enabled or not from the Searches, Reports, and Alerts tab on Splunk.
Check that for given search query there is any data for the past 30 minutes.
Check that the proper Title is given for the correlation search.

Lookup

If it seems that the lansweeper_site_mapping_lookup lookup is not having any site_id, then check that the newer token is generated or not.
Check ta_lansweeper_validators.log file for further analysis.

Custom Command

Check the newer token is generated for your application, then update the newer one in Configuration -> Account page.
Check ta_lansweeper_lsip_command.log or ta_lansweeper_lsmac_command.log file for further analysis.
