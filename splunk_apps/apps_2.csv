System Requirements: This app is tested and working on Ubuntu and OSX 10.12, and 10.13. You will need Splunk Enterprise in order to run this app. 
The main purpose for this Add-on is to get your Fitbit activity and sleep data into Splunk in a fast and efficient manner. 
Installation:
To install this add-on, you can can navigate to “Manage Apps” in your Splunk installation and then “Browse More Apps”. From there you can find the Fitbit Add-on for Splunk and install it.
Distributed Environment requirements: In a distributed environment, this Add-on is only needed on your Indexing tier.
Configuration:
From your Splunk installation:

Go to Manage Apps
Find the the ""Setup"" link for the Fitbit Add-on for Splunk.
There you will be provided with a Graphical User Interface for configuring the Add-on along with instructions.

Index:
By default, the Fitbit Add-on for Splunk indexes into a data called ""iot"". If you don't have that index created, you'll need to modify the inputs.conf file. 
Deauthorizing an access token
If you no longer want your API Key to be able to access your Fitbit Account, you can visit the Setup link for the GUI (as described in the configuration section) and delete your token. 
The Fitbit REST API only provides tokens that are good for a max of 8 hours. Our app takes care of refreshing this token for you. If you delete this token from the GUI, it will no longer be refreshed and will dissolve. 
Troubleshooting:


Ensure you have your $SPLUNK_HOME variable set. More information on this can be found here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Splunk


You can also view internal logs about the Add-on by using the following search:

The Splunk App for Stream also contains several dashboards for common Stream data sources as well as tools for understanding and estimating the volume of Stream data that is collected.
The Splunk App for Stream is only installed on Search Heads or wherever forwarder management is performed.

Before the 7.3 release this package was shipped with the Splunk Add-on for Stream Forwarders (Splunk_TA_stream). This app has been broken into the following packages:


Splunk App for Stream (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1809): Forwarder management, dashboards, calculators and admin tools


Splunk Add-on for Stream Wire Data (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5234): Knowledge objects for parsing Stream data for use by users. Installed on Indexers and Search Heads.


Splunk Add-on for Stream Forwarders (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5238): Network data collection tools for capturing network data, interpreting protocols, extracting custom fields and sending to Splunk. Installed on Splunk Universal or Heavy Forwarders.



Please see migration steps for moving from 7.2 to 7.3 in the Stream doumentation to prepare for this migraiton:

1. Add additional data to the standard Splunk alert payload.
2. Define the Activu webhook to send the alerts to.
3. Choose the action to invoke on the Activu side.
System Requirements:
- There are no special requirements, app is compatible both with the Splunk Cloud and On-Premise environments.
Configuration:
- Once you installed the app when you get the “App setup required” prompt - choose ""Set up later"".
- Before configuring and using the app, you need to contact an Activu representative to set up your Display(s) and get the required configuration settings.
- Once everything is in place on the Activu side, configure all the required settings from the Splunk Web UI ->  Apps -> Manage apps -> Set Up action on Activu alerts
Additional public information about this software can be found at: https://activu.com/splunk-documentation
Troubleshooting:
- Any problems with pulling the available action names from Activu REST API will be shown in the Activu alert dropdown or in <SPLUNK_HOME>/var/log/splunk/getactivuactions.log
- If the alerts do not arrive in Activu, search for ""sendmodalert - action=Activu"" errors and status codes in <SPLUNK_HOME>/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log

Dislaimer: Use as is. Neither Splunk nor the author is responsible for the use
or misuse of this app.
Welcome to the SplunkStart app for Splunk, which will be called Splunk Start
for the rest of this write up.
This app will use your data and field extractions to create dashboards with
your titles for the panels using Python scripts to substitute macros. It also
comes with a sample custom Splunk command and sample modular alert that you
can edit to put in your own code to test it out. This is explained in the
end of this file.
NOTE: KEEP ALL NAMES UNIQUE for macros, saved searches, and titles.
1)
First untar (example: tar xzvf SplunkStart.tgz) the whole distribution into a clean Splunk
etc/apps directory. This will create the SplunkStart app. If you are using
Search Heads and Indexers, install this app on the Search Head. If you are only
using one indexer and no Search Head, install this app on the Indexer.
The Advance Visual Dashboard is dependent upon Splunk Advance Visualizations
available for free from Splunkbase. Please download the following apps from
Splunkbase and install in the same instance as Splunk Start.
Horizon Chart
https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3117/
Sankey Diagram
https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3112/
Status Indicator
https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3119/
Timeline
https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3120/
Treemap
https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3118/
This will load the sankey, timeline, status indicator,
treemap, and horizon chart modular visuals downloaded from Splunkbase
into the directory. You can update these TA s, whenever you want.
/* Optional ***/
Next copy or move the directory
splunk-modular-alert-advice in SplunkStart/src/apps to your
$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps directory.
Change permissions for the Python scripts in the modular alerts directory:
chmod 755 $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/splunk-modular-alert-advice/bin/get_advice_log_message.py
chmod 755 $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/splunk-modular-alert-advice/bin/modular_alert_example_app/*
/* Optional **/
(If you want to try out the distribution out of the box, please go to
 Splunkbase and download the Eventgen TA. It is located at:
https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1924/
Next, install the Cisco ASA TA from Splunkbase on the same instance:
https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1620/
/* NOTE: As of 2019, the Cisco TA does not include sample data. You will have to
provide your own sample Cisco ASA data that is CIM compliant, if you want to
test with this data source. It is not required to test with this data source.
The same is true of the Splunk for Bluecoat TA. ****/
Install the Eventgen TA as per the instructions otherwise you will have empty
dashboards when you first install SplunkStart.
This will also load the cisco FW TA's (for sample events) into the apps 
directory. Finally, splunk_modular_alert_advice will be loaded into
$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps. The way to use the App is to install the Eventgen 
first and just restart Splunk and look at the included dashboards: Timecharts,
Tops/Rares, Stats, Advance Visuals, Simple Analytics, Lookups, and Maps. This
should just work and get you a foundation app.)
1A) Optional. This is only needed if you rename the SplunkStart Directory to
another name.
In the bin directory, there is a shell script called change_app_dir_name.sh.
If you make a copy of ORIGINAL SplunkStart app (the one you download) and put
it into the same SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps, you would go into each copy’s bin
directory and run this script to change the names of all hard coded places
that used be called SplunkStart. For example, copy SplunkStart to
 $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SA1, $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SB2,
 $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SC3.
Then, go into each app's bin directory (cd $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SA1/bin) and
run:
./ change_app_dir_name.sh SA1
cd ../../SB2
./ change_app_dir_name.sh SB3
cd ../../SC3
./ change_app_dir_name.sh SC3
Now, assign each user their own app dirctory to work from (SA1, SB2, SC3, etc).
2)
Next, load your own data into the Splunk indexer with proper sourcetypes and
field extractions as needed. Now, you are ready to use your own data with the
included dashboards. 
If you don't understand your data in terms of index names, sourcestypes, and
field names that you are entitled to view, then from the SplunkStart app,
click on the ""Discover Fields"" menu item and click on an index and sourcetype
to discover these things to find out the cardinality of your field values
along with whether they represent strings, numbers, or IP addresses.
There are two ways to update the dashboards after you understand your field
names. One is through the web interface of the app (recommended) and for
advance users, use command line.
GUI to Update app with your Data:
Under ""Configure Splunk Start App"", click on ""Modify Dashboard Macros"". This is
also the screen that can be used to turn on or turn off the Show SPL and Toggle
Comments button. You will see each dashboard listed along with the names of
each macro and their respective parameters that drive the dashboards. Simply
change the macro defintion to be your data. For instance Under Timecharts,
there is a panel called Timechart Averages. Change the macro to use your data
Before:
mac_timechart_avg(main,cisco:asa, bytes_out, 1m, -15m, now)
Sample After using this data, which is what we call ""your data"":
mac_timechart_avg(main,bluecoat:proxysg:access:syslog, bytes, 1m, -60m, now)
NOTE: if you want to use more than one sourcetype, use a notation such as this
example for the sourcetype field: A OR sourcetype::B OR sourcetype::C
where A,B, and C are your sourcetype names. The same approach should work if
you want to use more than one index.
The parameters for each macro are listed. Then press the ""Save Macros"" button
and press the ""See Current Dashboard"" to see if it worked. If it did not work,
you can simply change the macro again and test it again. You can do this for
each macro in each dashboard or leave some as is.
If you want to do this all at once, you can click on ""Advance Macro Edit"" and
load a file that has a list of all the macros that come with the app and
change all the macros at once on that page. For convience, sample macro files
are provided in the app's src/macros directory.
To change the Titles Dashboard Panels:
Click on Configure Splunk Start App and click on ""Change Dashboard Titles""
Just as with Change Macros, each panel is listed with its current title. Just
write in your own title and make sure to use uniqe names for each panel's
title. You can do this one title at a time or you can click on ""Advance Title
Edit"" and write a comma delimited list of old titles and your new titles.
We populate the old titles for you. You can also import a CSV file that has
this format to use. For convience, samples are provided in the app's src/titles
directory.
After making changes to macros and titles, if you are in an admin role, you
don't need to restart Splunk. However, if you are not in an admin role, you
will need to restart Splunk as the http://<host:port>/debug/refresh REST API
sent to Splunk underneath after pressing ""Save.."" requires admin role rights
to work without a restart. To avoid restarts, you can give the user the web_debug
capability in their role, which will allow debug/refresh to run in the background.
To do this, Go to Settings->Access Control->Roles and click on the role for your
user. Then under capabilites, find the web_debug capability and grant this to
the role. Save the role. This reloads the apps automatically after this
capability is granted. DO THIS ONLY FOR DEVELOPMENT.
For Advance Users: Change Macros and Titles by editting a file:
You can change macros  by just editing one file: src/macros/my_macros.txt.
(Make a copy of this file to edit in the same directory).
Each line not listed as a comment represents a search and a panel in dashboard.
Simply put in your index, sourcetype, field(s), and earliest time for a macro.
The file is fully commented to get you started. Save the file and run the
following python command located in the bin directory as directed:

bin/substitute_macros.py src/macros/my_macros.txt default/savedsearches.conf

This will read the default savedsearches.conf and substitute your macros.txt
to generate a local_savedsearches.conf. Copy and rename:

mv local_savedsearches.conf local/savedsearches.conf

(Make a local directory under SplunkStart, if it does not exist.)
Restart Splunk and see your data within the dashboards. You can further
change the saved searches from Settings, but note that these changes will not
be reflected in your my_macros.txt file.
(As a side note, after this works, you may want to disable the EventGen app OR
rename eventgen.conf to something else in the Cisco TA or disable each input
in the eventgen.conf so that the previous events are no longer being generated
since you are now using your own data.)
3) 
   Now that you understand how to use your own data within the dashboards,
   you can now make a copy of macros.conf into local/macros.conf and edit
   searches to include filters and other options in the Splunk search
   as needed. If you change the number of parameters to the macro, make the
   same change to your saved_searches.conf and my_macros.txt. Also,for a good
   demo, change the title of each panel and dashboard (labels) to match your
   use case. That can be done from the GUI.
3a) There is a bonus macro called mac_outliers that finds outlier fields
   values have a count greater than the average count plus standard deviation
   of all event counts. You can run that macro as is from the search bar:
mac_outliers(index name, sourcetype, field name, earliest, latest)
This app should be generic enough to use for any use case such as security,
telco, internet of things, financial services, etc.
More macros and dashboards are to come.

Updating Panel Titles Automatically through the command line
Rather than use the web interface of the app to update title and
rather than update each panel's title in each XML view file manually, you can
do this in one file. First cd into the src/titles directory. Then, edit the
titles.csv file. For each line, in the 2nd column put in
your new title to substitute from the original title. Save the file.
Then, run the sh script in the bin directory from SplunkStart root directory:

bin/substitute_titles.sh src/titles/titles.csv

This will change all titles for all panels in the local view directory that
matches the original names. It will also make a copy of all dashboards in
default/data/ui/views and copy them to local/data/ui/views. If the dashboard
already exists in the local view directory, it will be used instead of a new
copy from the default view directory.
If you have admin permission you can simpy do
this to change the UI titles after this step without restarting Splunk:
http://<name of Spunk server>:8000/en-US/debug/refresh and click on refresh.
If you do not have admin permsissions, restart Splunk.
--------- Adding new content or dashboard (Advance Users) ---------
You can create brand new macros and dashboards to add to the app that have
parameterized input. Under ""Configure Splunk Start App"", click on ""Add New
Content""
Fill in the definition of the macro (example provided on the page) and name
your macro with an unique name. Press Create. If What will appear in the
local/macros.conf file looks good, press Submit. Next, click on ""Add Saved
Search"" and name your search with an unique name. Now, click from the macro
list one of the macros you want to use. Fill in the parameters for each field
with your data. Press ""Submit Saved Search"" This creates a new saved search
in local/savedsearches.conf
Now, click on ""Add Dashboard Page"" and type in the name of a new dashboard
and use an unique label to describe the dashboard. Click ""Add Dashbord""
Finally, click on ""Add Panel to Dashboard"" and choose a dashboard, saved
search, type of visualization for the search, and a title for your panel. Then,
press ""Save Panel""
If you make a mistake or want to edit your content, please go to Settings on
top of the app and change macros via ""Advance Search"", change saved searches
via ""Searches, Reports, and Alert"" and change dashboards via ""User Interface""
views.
To add comments to each panel to appear in Splunk, go to Settings->
User Interface->Views->Click on your Dashboard name.
For each panel, place the following snippet of HTML code right after
the <panel> tag:
<html>
                <div id=""myDIV"" style=""display: none"">
                Your Comment goes Here.
                </div>
</html>
The id=""myDiv"" can be any string from myDiv, myDiv1,...myDiv5. This means,
we recommend at most 6 panels per dashboard.
To Create Content Manually without using the app:
1) Create a new search in a local/macros.conf. Make sure the name of the macro
   starts with mac_.
2) Add that macro with real parameters to a search in local/savedsearches.conf
3) Create a new dashboard with a panel in local/data/ui/views/ that calls
   the search in local/savedsearches.conf. Name your dashboard
   <your name>_dashboard.xml
For each panel in the dashboard, before the </panel> tag, place the
   following HTML snippet:
<html>
    <button class=""btn btn-default"" id=""POC_Test"" style=""float: right;"">
    Show SPL</button>
</html>
You may also put in a comment in HTML in each panel as discussed above
right after each <panel> tag.

4) Create a new entry in your src/macros/my_macros.txt file that reflects the
   name of the new macro with actual parameter names. Comment the file.
5) Create a new entry in your src/titles/titles.csv file that reflects the
   name of your title in the panel in the new dashboard in the first column
   with a suggested name to change the title in column 2.
6) Restart Splunk.
--------- Custom Splunk Command  -------------
This app ships with a custom Splunk command that you can use to test out how
to write a custom command.
Background
In the app's default directory, you'll see a commands.conf file. This is the
file that declares the custom commmand. I have put in the minimal attributes
for the stanza. It has the name of the commmand and Python script it invokes.
In the metadata directory, there is a file called local.meta that provides
role based access to the custom command. I have simply added:
[commands/mycommand]
access = read : [ * ], write : [ admin ]
export = system
to the file to say this command (mycommmand) can be read by anyone on the
system and written to only by the admin role.
Python Script
In the app's bin directory, you'll see the mycommand.py. Look at this file and
you'll see some boiler plate code. The heart of this ""generating"" commmand is
in the *** Put in your custom Code.
This implemenation simply taket the _raw event (r[""_raw""] field) and shifts
each alphabetical character 13 positions, which is the famous rot13 trick. You
can remove this and put in any code you want to generate more fields and store
them in the r[""<name_of_your_field""]. The usage for this commmand is:
<some search that returns raw events>|mycommmand|table _raw
Example:
sourcetype=cisco:asa|mycommmand|table _time, _raw
**Modular Alert** Based on Luke Murphey's Blog
The distribution comes with an already configured Modular Alert that you can
invoke as an alert action. It simply writes some trivial advice gathered from
an URL to the Splunk _internal index. Most of this is based on Luke Murphey's
Blog: https://www.splunk.com/blog/2016/08/22/how-to-create-a-modular-alert/
if you want detailed explanation. The modular alert takes a URL as input from
the user so that it can be invoked at alert time to gather the trivial advice.
I have provided a sample URL as a default. If you would like to run it, set
up an alert condition in Splunk and choose the Splunk Start icon as the alert
action. If you don't have a URL to gather advice for the _internal logs, simply
choose the default URL. Once the alert happens, you can search for it:
index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd component=sendmodalert
         action=""get_advice_log_message""
If you want to keep the same structure, but change the code, go into the
splunk-modular-alert-advice/bin directory to edit the get_advice_log_message.py
file. The actual work is done in the run method that invokes the custom
make_the_log_method, which uses the URL passed into the alert to GET the
advice. If you want to customize this, you can use the payload object
(someVarible = payload.get(<name of field)) to get everything about the
alert such as the name of the search that invoked it, the event/results file,
etc. See this answer for details:
https://answers.splunk.com/answers/442603/how-do-i-get-the-8-standard-alert-action-script-pa-1.html
Go change the code to do something besides gathering trivial advice to put into
the _internal index.",Version 1.4.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/d0c2f266-1655-11ec-90c2-fa3120aa9d6a.png,Utilities,https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-software-license-agreement.html,"1,582",0,splunk,5,1,Splunk Works,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/splunklabs,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

Next Generation and Datacenter Firewalls
Overview
Fortinet FortiGate Add-On for Splunk is the technical add-on (TA) developed by Fortinet, Inc.  The add-on enables Splunk Enterprise to ingest or map security and traffic data collected from FortiGate physical and virtual appliances across domains. The key features include: 
•    Streamlining authentication and access from FortiGate such as administrator login, user login, VPN termination authentication into to Splunk Enterprise Security Access Center
•   Mapping FortiGate virus report into Splunk Enterprise Security Endpoint Malware Center
•   Ingesting traffic logs, IPS logs, system configuration logs and Web filtering data etc. 
Fortinet FortiGate Add-On for Splunk provides common information model (CIM) knowledge, advanced “saved search”, indexers and macros to use with other Splunk Enterprise apps such as Splunk App for Enterprise Security. 
Dependencies
If used with apps that are based on CIM, Splunk Common Information Model Add-on will need to be installed.
Please make sure FortiGate FOS version is 5.0 or later.
Configuration Steps
Install Fortinet FortiGate Add-on for Splunk on search head, indexer, forwarder or single instance Splunk server:
Note: There is a 3rd party add-on for Fortinet named Fortinet Fortigate with FortiOS 5 Add-On with folder name TA-fortinet, which has conflict with Fortinet FortiGate Add-on for Splunk, so you need to disable the 3rd party add-on before you proceed.
There are three ways to install the add-on:

Install from Splunk web UI: Manage Apps->Browse more apps->Search keyword “Fortinet” and find the add-on with Fortinet logo->Click “Install free” button->Click restart splunk service.
Install from file on Splunk web UI: Manage Apps->Install from file->Upload the .tgz file which is downloaded from https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps ->check the upgrade box-> click restart splunk service.
Install from file on Splunk server CLI interface: Extract the .tgz file->Place the Splunk_TA_fortinet_fortigate folder under $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps-> Restart Splunk service.

Add data input on Splunk server:
Note: From version 1.2, the Splunk TA(Add-on) for fortigate no longer match wildcard source or sourcetype to extract fortigate log data, a default sourcetype fortigate_log is specified in default/props.conf instead, please follow the instruction below to configure your input and props.conf for the App and TA(Add-on).
Through Splunk Web UI:
Settings->Data Input->UDP
Port: 514 (Example, can be modified according to your own plan) 
leave other parameters as is.
Note: the UDP port, 514 in this example should be opened in firewall for logs to pass through. If you choose TCP input and on FortiGate use ""reliable""(tcp) mode for syslog setting, you will need to add the following in local/props.conf because tcp tranported syslog will have xxx <yyy> header as line indicator.(8514 below is an example of TCP port, you can choose your own. There is no timestamp header like UDP so you can specify the timestamp field in the fortigate log, in our case the precision is in nanoseconds so the time format is %s%9N. If your FOS version has time stamp in different precision, refer to: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.1.1/SearchReference/Commontimeformatvariables)
[source::tcp:8514]
SHOULD_LINEMERGE = false
LINE_BREAKER = (\d{2,3}\s+<\d{2,3}>)
TIME_PREFIX = eventtime=
TIME_FORMAT = %s%9N
If you are forwarding FortiGate logs from Fortianalyzer, please make sure you set the format to syslog instead of the default CEF format.
Fortinet FortiGate Add-On for Splunk will by default automatically extract FortiGate log data from inputs with sourcetype 'fortigate_log'. 
If you want to configure it to extract a self-defined sourcetype, copy the props.conf 
in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Splunk_TA_fortinet_fortigate/default/props.conf to 
$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Splunk_TA_fortinet_fortigate/local/props.conf and change the source stanza.
replace [fortigate_log] with [fortigate], for instance.
Restart Splunk service for the change to take effect.
Verify the Add-on in Enterprise Security App
Available dashboards in Enterprise Security App supported by Fortinet Fortigate Add-on for Splunk.

**Update:
This app is for Splunk v5 and prior.  Try our new app designed to work for Splunk v6 at http://apps.splunk.com/app/1845/. We are accepting user feedback at: Tony.Lee -at- FireEye.com. Thanks!
This app can be installed on Splunk v6 using the instructions found here:  http://securitysynapse.com/2014/05/stopgap-splunk-for-fireeye-v2-app.html
However, this app is designed to work on Splunk 4.3.x and 5.x due to its heavy use of HTML 5 dashboards.  A new app will be written from scratch to take advantage of new Splunk v6 features.
For any help or feedback for this app please post your questions to answers.splunk.com and add the FireEye tag your question
The 1.x versions of this app relied on the syslog data from FireEye devices. The views, dashboards and extractions in the current app rely on the XML output format from FireEye. While the previous version's views and dashboards are included in this app, they have not been tested with the XML data format. If you really want the previous dashboards, we suggest that you not upgrade to version 2.x. OR you can customize the older views to match the fileds based on the XML.
You will have to configure the FireEye to export event via http, xml in order for this app to work. Please see the FireEye Config section below for details. Short version: The http location for the FireEye log forwarding is to be of the form below:
https://localhost:8089/services/receivers/simple?source=FE_test&sourcetype=fe_xml&index=fe
You should replace 'localhost', above with the name of your splunk server. Do Not change the sourcetype or the index parameters above. They will break the dashboards and extractions.
Common Issues
-- There is nothing on the main page.
\- The main overview page is a realtime view. So if you don't have events in the last 5 minutes. The dashboards will be empty
-- The Malware overview page has an empty dashboard for the Business Units impacted
\- The business Unit chart works off a lookup table. You will have to create/use a lookup table that is built for your environment. The lookup table used by default is located at $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/FireEye/lookups/asset_lookup.csv. For more detail on lookup tables please see this link:  
-- Browser hangs on certain searches with very large events. 
\- In very rare cases, for very large events, in excess of 2 Mb. the web browser hangs when attempting to return the event in the Events list.
\- Use the table command to use the table view with specific fields instead of the entire event. e.g. alert_id=1234 | table malware_name src_ip dst_ip
Dependencies
The app requires the following Splunk Apps available from Splunk Base  :
- Splunk for Google Maps
- Splunk for Geo Location Lookup Script
You do not need to install these apps if you do not wish to use the Apps mapping and geo location features. The main dashboard will not render properly without the above apps.
 Installing 
Ensure that the apps listed in the Dependencies section are installed.
Installing via the Web UI :
Go to Manager -> Apps -> Find more apps online: search for fireeye -> Click on the 'Install Free' link below the FireEye app (not the TA-fireeye) -> Ready to install Page -> Install 
Check the Upgrade button if you have an older version installed
Installing from command line:
- Unpack the fireeye.spl file using: tar -vxzf fireeye.spl.
- Move the resulting FireEye directoryinto $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps
- Restart Splunk
 FireEye Config 
You will have to modify your FireyEye's logging configuration to send the
logs to Splunk in xml via http. To do this, on your FireEye appliance, go
to the Settings menu Tab, then Notifications on the left side submenu.
Select http from the Protocol options.
In the HTTP Configuration Server Listing configuration, enter a name value
and click Add HTTP Server. You will see your newly added server name
listed below. Populate the values appropriately:
Server Url :  
ame&sourcetype=fe_xml&index=fe

You must replace the ""SplunkServerIP"" with correct IP of your Splunk
server instance, it is also recommended that you replace
""FireEyeServerName"" with the host name of FireEye MPS system from which
alerts will be sent from.

Auth : Must be checked
Username : Enter your Splunk login username
Password: Enter your Splunk login password
Notifications : Select All Events (recommended)
Delivery : Select Per Event (recommended)
SSL Enable : Must be selected
Message Format : XML Extended ( recommended, but any XML option can be
used)
Lastly, you should disable the syslog or any other notifications to
Splunk; unless you want the notifications ingested twice.
 Source types 
As Splunk indexes your FireEye data, the app will rename the sourcetypes to FireEye_CEF, for the standard syslog, CEF format and fe_xml for the XML data.
In order to get the XML data into Splunk you will have to modify your FireEye appliance by going to the Notifications section in the appliance's web ui, select http and XML for the format. The URL will be of the form below, except replace localhost with the name of your splunk server. You can also replace the source=FE_test with the name you want for your FireEye. The index=fe and the sorucetype=fe_xml should not be changed. the dashboards and views rely on the fe index and the fe_xml source type being present.
https://localhost:8089/services/receivers/simple?source=FE_test&sourcetype=fe_xml&index=fe
 Search macros 
The dashboards rely on the search macros for views. These macros are defined in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SplunkforFireEye/default/macros.conf.
You should only edit the base macros. Base Macros begin with BASE in their name. E.g. BASE-FireEye_index. If you already have data that has been indexed as a different sourcetype, add your sourcetype to the definition. For example:
definition = sourcetype=""fe_xml"" OR sourcetype=""foo"" OR sourcetype=""bar""
Important: All other macros should not be edited.
 Lookups 
Lookups are provided for a sample environment to resolve IP addresses machine hostnames to Users and business units. The lookup will have to be modified to fit your environment.
Using the form fields on the dashboards
All the dashboards work without any filtering values for the form fields. If you want to filter based on a field you should use asterisks before and after the search terms unless you are absolutely sure of the filter value. e.g. you can use 172.168. for IP addresses or Trojan for malware names.
Keep in mind that searches that have longer time ranges may take a little longer to return the results.

Steps to Ingest CEF Data

Edit $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Gigamon_Application_Intelligence/appserver/static/library/gigamon_cef_inputs.conf to change the receiver port to your local settings (replace PORT).
Copy ""gigamon_cef_inputs.conf"" to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Gigamon_Application_Intelligence/inputs.conf

Here is an example output of inputs.conf file
[udp://10514]
connection_host = ip
sourcetype = cefevents
10514 above is the port number. Change it to whatever the port number desired. Make sure that it matches with port number configuration on GigaSMART device.
Gigamon and Stream Integration ::gsi::
The Gigamon and Stream integration requires precise adherence to the instructions. Failure to do so may cause Stream to not collect the Gigamon IPFIX data appropriately.
The GSI (Gigamon and Stream Integration) is an advanced configuration technique, designed to extend the protocol decoding abilities of Splunk Stream. As this feature relies on Splunk Stream, Splunk Stream is a requirement and must be installed on your Splunk server(s). Please see the instructions on how to install Splunk Stream.
Install Stream ::ss_install::
If you are installing Stream for the first time, the preferred version at this time is 7.2.0. If you have an existing stream installation, ensure the version number is 7.2.0 (other versions, if available, have not been tested).

Splunk Stream Documentation

NOTE: The NIC associated with the Netflow collection should not be in promiscuous mode. Stream is being used as a protocol decoder in this configuration only.
Extend Stream
In order to extend the base installation of Stream, there must be file-level changes made. There are two installation methods, script and manual. The base location of the Gigamon-specific configuration is $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Gigamon_Application_Intelligence/appserver/static/library. $SPLUNK_HOME refers to the install location of Splunk. Start in the library folder mentioned, and then proceed to either Manual Configuration or Scripted Installation.
Manual Configuration ::install_manual::
This configuration method requires the user to edit and copy various files to locations in the splunk_app_stream and Splunk_TA_stream apps. $SPLUNK_HOME refers to the install location of Splunk.
Install into Stream ::install_stream_manual::

Edit $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Gigamon_Application_Intelligence/appserver/static/library/gigamon_streamfwd.conf to change the reciever IP and Port to your local settings (replace @@IP and @@PORT).
Copy $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Gigamon_Application_Intelligence/appserver/static/library/gigamon_streamfwd.conf to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/splunk_app_stream/local/streamfwd.conf and $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Splunk_TA_stream/local/streamfwd.conf.

Copy the Splunk Stream Version-specific vocabulary file (see file names right below) to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/splunk_app_stream/default/vocabularies/gigamon.xml and $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Splunk_TA_stream/default/vocabularies/gigamon.xml.

For Splunk Stream 7.1.3: gigamon_vocabulary_7.1.3.xml
For Splunk Stream 7.2.0: gigamon_vocabulary_7.2.0.xml



Copy $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Gigamon_Application_Intelligence/appserver/static/library/gigamon_stream.json to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/splunk_app_stream/default/streams/netflow.

GigaSMART occasionally sends data elements encoded in ASN.1 to Stream. To avoid excessive license usage, apply the following fix.
On the system indexing the Stream data (typically where splunk_app_stream is installed), edit the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/splunk_app_stream/local/props.conf file.
For the stanza [stream:netflow], add this line of configuration: SEDCMD-remove_nulls_gigamon = s/\\u0000//g. If the stanza doesn't exist, create it.
This SEDCMD will remove any data that cannot be decoded correctly.


Restart Splunk.
Configure Stream via the steps at Stream Configuration.

Stream Configuration ::stream_config::
Full and complete documentation of Stream Configuration is located at docs.splunk.com. This instructions use Stream 7.2.0 as the basis.

On the Splunk Home page, click on the app “Splunk Stream”
Use the navigation bar: Configuration -> Configure Streams

Configure GigaSMART
Now that Stream is configured to accept Gigamon Elements, configure the Gigamon appliance that has the GigaSMART card installed. Gigamon provides documentation to configure netflow and metadata generation, and there is also a third-party step-by-step tutorial that may help configure the GigaSMART.
NOTE: There is an option within the GigaSMART Exporter configuration to set the Template Refresh Interval. This setting should be set to AT MOST 2 minutes.  
Distributed Stream Deployment
If you are pushing Splunk_TA_stream to a universal forwarder in a distributed deployment, then you must make the same changes for Splunk_TA_stream above in the deployment-apps folder
Stream Upgrade Notes


When upgrading Stream:

the splunk_app_stream vocabulary file will be deleted. This needs restored with the correct version of the vocab.
Follow Step 3 in the Manual Configuration.


the splunk_app_stream stream file will be deleted. This needs restored with the correct version of the stream.
Follow Step 4 in the Manual Configuration.


the change in streams (metadata vs packet) [Splunk Stream 7.0.1 -> 7.1.x] requires the deletion and re-addition of the configured netflow stream.



If the netflow stream file is changed, any existing streams using that stream configuration need to be deleted and re-added.

OVERVIEW
Technology add-on (TA) for CrowdStrike enables current CrowdStrike customers to ingest alert data from the Streaming API as well as view and push custom indicators via the Query API. 
This TA also supports (and is required for) the CrowdStrike Falcon App for Splunk: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3943/

Author - CrowdStrike
Creates Index - False
Compatible with:
Splunk Enterprise version: 6.4.x, 6.5.x, 6.6.x, 7.0.x, 7.1.x, 7.3.x, 8.0.x
OS: Platform independent
Splunk Cloud (Heavy Forwarder Required)



For more information about the CrowdStrike APIs please refer to ‘Docs’ under the ‘Support’ section in the Falcon Interface.

DEPLOYMENT
Prior to deploying this Technology Add-on review the following:

To receive event data a valid and enabled set of credentials for the Streaming API is required. This consists of an API UUID and an API Key. These can be generated through the Falcon UI and if being generated for the first time CrowdStrike support should be notified to enable the Streaming API. NOTE regenerating this credential set WILL INVALIDATE AN EXISTING SET.
To view and/or push custom indicators to the Falcon platform a valid set of credentials for the Query API is required. This consists of a username and password. Currently these can only be acquired through CrowdStrike support. Please refer to the Query API documentation for details on this process.
Ensure that any Proxies or Firewalls that the API communications will traverse have been properly configured (see the ‘Configuration Section’ – ‘Configuring Proxies’). The APIs currently leverage certificate-based authentication (TLS over port 443) and should be exempted from any SSL proxying.

Ensure that any Firewalls in the environment will allow the Streaming API connection to establish a long-life HTTPS connection. This connection is maintained to reduce latency of alert reporting. 
Please refer to the API documentation in the Falcon UI for specific URLs and IP addresses that should be whitelisted.



INSTALLATION
There are currently two components within a Splunk environment where this TA should be installed: Heavy Forwarders and Search Heads. Install the TA bundle by:

Downloading the TA package
In the UI navigate to: “Manage Apps’
In the top right corner select ‘Install app from file’
Select ‘Choose File’ and select the TA package
Select ‘Upload’ and follow the prompts – restarting Splunk as necessary


CONFIGURATION
Configuring Proxies
Only perform this configuration if needed for authentication - SSL proxies are NOT supported
  1.  Navigate to Technology Add-on for CrowdStrike
  2.  In the sub-menu select ""Configuration"" 
  3.  Select the ‘Proxy’ tab
  4.  Check the ‘Enable’ checkbox
  5.  Select the proxy type
  6.  Enter the host information for the proxy
  7.  Enter the port used by the proxy
  8.  Enter a valid username
  9.  Enter a valid password
Configuring CrowdStrike Account(s)
The TA can be configured with two different CrowdStrike APIs credentials:
  *  Streaming API: This will provide event and audit data
  *  Query API: This will provide custom indicator visibility and push capability

Navigate to Technology Add-on for CrowdStrike, 
In the sub-menu select ""Configuration"" 
In the right corner select “Add Account”
Enter a unique name for the configuration (NOTE: Names cannot contain blank spaces)
Select the API account type
Streaming – The Streaming API requires an active API UUID and API Key and is used to receive alerts from the Falcon platform.
Query – The Query API is used by the ‘CrowdStrike Falcon App For Splunk’ to show and upload custom indicators to the Falcon platform.


Enter either an API UUID or Username (depending on the API type selected)
Enter either an API Key or Password (depending on the API type selected)
Verify that the information that has been entered is correct and select ‘Add’
Note at this point the TA will attempt to validate the entered credentials. If the credentials are not correct, not active or a connection cannot be established the account will not be added. 

Configuring CrowdStrike Input(s)
In a distributed architecture and for Splunk Cloud this configuration should only be done on the Heavy Forwarders
DO NOT CONFIGURE INPUTS ON SEARCH HEADS OR SPLUNK CLOUD

Navigate to Technology Add-on for CrowdStrike, 
In the sub-menu select ""Inputs” 
In the right corner select “Create New Input”
Enter a unique name for the configuration
From the drop down select the appropriate account for the input type
(optional) Enter the offset number after which to collect data
(optional) Enter the start date from which to start the data collection
Enter the time interval for input
Select the index to store the data. NOTE The main index is used by default unless otherwise indicated. If a custom index in selected ensure that the “cs_get_index” macro is updated accordingly. If data is to be sent to a specific indexer ensure the outputs.conf file is adjusted with the Indexer’s IP address.

SPLUNK CLOUD CONSIDERTATIONS
This TA contains a data collection component and as such, per Splunk’s documentation, should be installed on a forwarder (only heavy forwarders are currently supported by CrowdStrike) for the data collection function:
“Apps and add-ons that contain a data collection component should be installed on forwarders for their data collection functions. See Install apps in your Splunk Cloud deployment.”
Using Custom Indexes
The TA creates a search macro that, by default, points to the ‘main’ index. If the data being collected is placed into a custom index this macro should be updated to reflect the index being used. The Endpoint and Intelligence TAs each leverage their own search macro. Search macros can be found under ‘settings’ -> ‘advanced search’.
    To modify this settings, perform the following:
  1.  Select ‘Settings’
  2.  Select ‘Advanced Search’
  3.  Select ‘Search Macros’
  4.  Select the appropriate CrowdStrike Technical Add-on
  5.  Select the name of the macro
  6.  Under definition ensure that the index being referred to in quotations is the index the data resides in
NOTE: The CrowdStrike App for Splunk leverages search macros to populate dashboard information. Failure to properly configure these macros can result in no/incorrect information being displayed.

SAMPLE EVENT GENERATOR
The TA comes with sample data files, which can be used to generate sample data for testing. In order to generate sample data it requires the SA-Eventgen app(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1924/). The TA will generate sample data for API calls at a 2 hour interval. You can modify this configuration from eventgen.conf file available under $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/default/.

TROUBLESHOOTING
Using Search
After several minutes use the following search to validate that data is being received:
`cs_get_index` | stats count by sourcetype

NOTE the macro MUST be enclosed with backticks to run correctly (on most keyboards this key is located to the left to the number 1 key – these are not apostrophes.
Below are some sourcetypes types that maybe returned:

crowdstrike:falconhost:json
crowdstrike:falconhost:query:json

Using Log Files

$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/ta-crowdstrike_falcon_host_api.log
$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/ta-crowdstrike_ucc_lib.log files.
$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/crowdstrike/

Connectivity Issues

Unable to save account input(s)
Ensure that the credentials matches the API type
Ensure that the API has been enabled by CrowdStrike Support
Ensure that Proxy settings have been properly configured in the TA
Ensure that Proxy and Firewall settings have been properly configured to allow unmodified communication


Receiving ‘401’ connection errors
Ensure that the credentials being leveraged have been entered correctly
Ensure that the correct credential sets are being used for the input
Ensure that the credentials have been activated by CrowdStrike support
Ensure that Proxy and Firewall settings are properly configured to allow unmodified communication


Not receiving data
Ensure that the API credentials have been activated by CrowdStrike support
Ensure that an input has been created
Ensure the proper credentials are assigned to the input  
Ensure that Proxy settings have been properly configured in the TA
Ensure that Proxy and Firewall settings have been properly configured to allow unmodified communication
(Splunk Cloud) Ensure that the collection activity is being performed by a heavy forwarder



External Credential Validation
Leverage a platform such as ‘Postman’ or the ‘curl’ command to validate connectivity and that the credentials are correct. For example of commands to run refer to the appropriate API guide in the Falcon UI.

The goal was to provide a “plug and play” solution to have a better pdf export.
This application is a client side solution , fully implemented using python and JavaScript (PhantomJS is required only if scheduling PDF export will be used).
How to install it :
Just UNTAR the folder into etc/apps (or use the Splunk> GUI).
When you open the smart exporter application for the first time you will be redirected to the setup page.
You can ignore this step (keep fields empty and save), if you will not use the scheduling export feature.
Requirement to schedule export : 
-    Splunk Credentials : a Splunk user/password having access to exported dashboards
-   PhantomJS bin path
-   Mail server information (host, port, user, …)
The application contains 3 samples dashboards : panels grouping, custom stylesheet, custom dataviz.
How to use it :
Once installed:
1-  open the dashboard to be exported and add a new panel.
2-  Select “Smart PDF Exporter” as data visualization.
3-  Enter any generating command as a search text (e.g  |makeresults )
4-  Move the new panel to the first row and save.
5-  Just click on the “smart export” button to start exporting current dashboard to PDF format.
Options:
How Scheduling PDF export works :
For security reasons , only users with the role “can_schedulepdf” are allowed to schedule PDF export.
This role is provided inside the application and contain needed capabilities to schedule searches and to access application passwords.
Panel screenshot:
Adding the “smart Exporter” button will add a new feature to the current dashboard : panel screenshot.
A new button will appear just next to the refresh button under each panel.
Clicking on it will take a screenshot of the current panel and download the picture.
Inputs and tokens:
Tokens and inputs values are a part of the dashboard’s url.
user can so generate a PDF export by token(s) value(s) :
e.g : 
guest_authentications_failed_last_60min.pdf 
and        guest_authentications_failed_last_24h.pdf          are 2 pdf generated from the same dashboard but with 2 different inputs.
-> if inputs are inserted in a row , the smart exporter application will add selected values to the generated PDF :
<row><panel> <input type=""multiselect"" token=""usage"">…</input></panel></row> 
Compatibilities :

The application is compatible with chrome , safari,  IE Edge and IE11.
Some issues was noticed with Firefox (dashboards containing table views) … under investigation.
Smart exporter is tested and compatible with Splunk> 7.1
Smart Exporter is compatible with all Splunk native data visualization , custom stylesheet and html , and with some custom data visualization.

Logs and investigation :
Smart Exporter will generate three log files under var/log/splunk/:
-   smartexporter_services.log  : logs generated by python helpers
-   smartexporter.log       : logs generated by custom endpoints
-   exportpdf.log           : custom command logs

||                        VulnDB Splunk Add-on                              ||
===============================================================================
The VulnDB Splunk Add-on is designed to communicate with the VulnDB database
of vulnerability information, accessible via REST API.  This application 
requires an active subscription to the VulnDB REST API.  
Prior to installation, be sure to have the TA-vuln-db.tgz or TA-vuln-db.spl 
file on your local machine (Web Interface installation) or on the target Splunk 
server(s) (Shell installation), where it is readily available for the 
installation process.
Installation - Web Interface:
Log into Splunk with an administrator account.
Click on the gear icon for Application Management.
Click on the ""Install app from file button"".
Click the ""Choose File"" button and browse to the location on your local machine
where the TA-vuln-db.tgz or TA-vuln-db.spl file is located and select it.
Check the ""Upgrade App"" checkbox to overwrite any previous versions of this app
Click the ""Upload button""
Installation - Shell:
Log into the shell for your Splunk server
Change to the Splunk application folder: 
cd $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps
Extract the application from the archive file: 
tar xzf <archive location>
Verify that the app has the proper permissions for the OS:
chown -R splunk:splunk $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-vuln-db
Restart Splunk
$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk restart
Configuration:
The VulnDB application has a straightforward configuration interface.
Before starting configuration of the application, you must have your Vuln DB
consumer API key, and consumer API secret in order to successfully add an 
input to Splunk for VulnDB vulnerability information.
Before adding an input for Vuln DB, please review the ""Configuration"" menu
option to make sure you put in your proxy server settings (if necessary) and
your logging level.
Once the app is installed, you can navigate to it by clicking on the Vuln DB app
on the left side of the Splunk web interface.
The first page that will appear is the Inputs page.
Click on the ""Create New Input"" button on the upper right of the Inputs page.
Fill in the information as requested on the Add vulndb input window:
Name       - The name of the input you wish to create.  Ie; vulndb_input
Interval   - The time interval in seconds between API requests to load data into
             Splunk (3600 = Every hour, 86400 = Once per day)
Index      - The Splunk index that you want to ingest the vulnerability events
             into
API URL    - The URL to access the VulnDB API (the default should work, but
             this might change at some point)
API Key    - The VulnDB consumer key assigned from Vuln DB.  You can get this
             from your Vuln DB account:
https://vulndb.cyberriskanalytics.com/users/sign_in
API Secret - The VulnDB consumer secret assigned from Vuln DB.  You can get 
             this from your account as well (see link above)
Start date - The starting date that you want to use to gather vulnerability 
             information from.  The API will return results that have 
             vulnerabilities that were modified on or after this date.
Page size  - The number of VulnDB results that the API should return in a 
             single request.  The maximum is 300.  This means if there are 
             800 new vulnerabilities updated since the last run, and your 
             page size is set to 300, the app will make 3 total API requests to
             the VulnDB API. If you are enabling the Affected Package Information, 
             CVSS v3 Metrics options or VulnDB Changelog Details then we 
             recommend providing 100 as page size.        
Reset Input- If for some reason, you need to re-ingest vulnerability information
             from the start date, you will have to check this box off in order
             to do so.  The app remembers the most recent date stamp, and by
             default will ignore the start date after the first run.
There are additional options available, which are documented in the VulnDB 
API reference manuals.
When you are finished selecting all of your desired options, you can click on 
the ""Add"" button to add the input.  The input will start to contact the Vuln
DB API immediately.  The first time the input runs, it may take a long period
of time to see results in Splunk.  Depedning upon your start date, the input
will be trying to retrieve 1000's or more vulnerability details.  Please
be patient, as the process takes time.  You can view activity in Splunk using
a search:
index=_internal source=*ta_vuln_db_vulndb.log
This will search the Vuln DB application log file for events.  Depending upon
the logging level selected, you will see various details about the input 
activity.

App Version
1.2.0


Vendor Products
SDK for Python 1.6.14



The TA-connectivity app can be used to gather host connectivity information. 
It leverages the multiprocessing library in python using a pool of 4 workers. 
It contains 3 different scripts namely; ping.py, webping.py and connect.py
Available at:
Splunkbase
Github
Note: This is not backward compatibile with releases before v0.4.
This app adds 3 modular inputs to any Splunk installation:
1. ping://
2. webping://
3. connect://
This also allows the specification of how many threads should be used to handle a provided list of hosts.
Scripts and binaries
Includes:
- Splunk SDK for Python (1.6.14)
- mail_lib - supports the calculation of vincenty distances which is used by default
    - ping.py - Tests connectivity using ICMP to multiple systems
    - webping - tests connectivity to multiple web application given the application URLs
    - connect - Checks TCP connectivity to a given socket (hostname and port)
    - connectivity_lib - library with exception handling, constants, and utility functions used for actually 
      connecting to hosts. 
        - connect_test.py   - function for testing connectivity to a TCP socket
        - constants.py      - contains constants used throughout the library
        - exceptions.py     - contains exceptions for ping / webping and connect modular inputs
        - pinger.py         - functions for pinging hosts from windows or unix systems.

Deploy to Splunk Cloud
For Splunk cloud installations, install TA-connectivity on a heavy forwarder that has been configured to forward 
events to your Splunk Cloud instance. 
You can work with Splunk Support on installing the Support add-on on Splunk Cloud.
Configure TA-connectivity
A list of hosts must be provided in the form of a lookup.
This requires a ""url"" field for testing webconnectivity using the webping modular input.
For ping and connect modular inputs, this expects a field for hostname and port .
If port field is not specified, it expects the host_field to be in the format hostname:port or IP:port.
Sample CSV:
hostname,port,url
www.google.com,80,https://encrypted.google.com
www.yahoo.com,80,http://www.yahoo.com
4.2.2.2,53,http://www.twitter.com
8.8.8.8,53,http://www.linkedin.com
Sample CSV2:
socket
www.google.com:80
www.yahoo.com:80
4.2.2.2:53
8.8.8.8:53
Test availability via Ping.
This input extracts hostnames or IP addreses from the host_field header column of the csv defined by the input.
If workers is not defined, it uses a default of 4 workers.
Example 1
[ping:///opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-connectivity/lookups/hostfile.txt]
host_field = hostname
workers = 4
interval = 600

uberAgent consists of two main components: the actual agent runs on the endpoints you want to be monitored, sending the data it collects to the configured backend either directly or via Splunk's Universal Forwarder. The second main component, implemented as a set of Splunk apps, provides dashboards, visualizations, searches, and reports.
The Agent
uberAgent's data collecting component is a lightweight agent that runs independently of any runtimes or frameworks. The agent's footprint is so small that it is truly unobtrusive on the monitored endpoints and does not affect user density.
Where other products rely on operating system sources such as performance counters, WMI, or similar unfiltered data, uberAgent comes with its own metrics. Instead of raw data uberAgent gives you information that matters (see uberAgent's list of metrics).
The agent is highly configurable: metrics can be turned on or off individually, the data collection frequency can be chosen freely, blacklists and whitelists (supporting regular expressions) allow for fine-grained control. This ensures that only data you really need is sent to the backend for indexing.
Browser Extensions
uberAgent's endpoint agent is complemented by browser extensions, which enable uberAgent to collect performance and usage metrics from web apps, too. Extensions are available for all major browsers.
The Splunk Apps
Multiple Splunk apps help process and visualize the data collected by the agent. The indexer app lives on Splunk indexers and mainly creates uberAgent's index and data input. Dashboard apps implement the user interface, providing different views into the collected data. uberAgent comes with two dashboard apps: one for uberAgent UXM and another for uberAgent ESA.
uberAgent's main apps are complemented by special-purpose apps that offer a different view of the existing uberAgent data, such as the uberAgent Helpdesk app.
Most dashboards are searchable and have extensive filtering capabilities to give you a fast and powerful way of isolating specific data. Time range pickers make it easy to go back to the exact time a problem occurred.
uberAgent makes full use of Splunk's advanced UI components to display a beautiful user interface that fluidly adapts to screen width and device type. As a result, it works equally well on a tablet as on a PC or Mac.

USER GUIDE
Key concepts for ProtectWise App for Splunk
The ProtectWise App for Splunk uses the power of ProtectWise and combines it with the search power of Splunk. Investigations of Events and Observations can take advantage of Splunk's business intelligence interface and search system UI that allows users to pivot into the ProtectWise Visualizer.
Investigative Dashboard
Investigation focuses on Events and their associated Observations. It features in-page drilldowns that provide the user the details of each observations that attributed to an event. Users can search other data sources in Splunk for specific destination or source IPs by utilizing the workflow actions associated with the Observation Details panel.
Situational Details Dashboard
This dashboard focuses on all ProtectWise observations. Provides an overview of the observation Killchain Stages and displays the trend over time. Users can see details about each observations filtering by type, host, or category. Clicking on an IP in the Observation Details panel directs users to the ProtectWise Visualizer to further their investigation.
Transfom/Alias
Field aliases that normalize the ProtectWise data to fit the CIM can be found in the props.conf file in the app.",Version 1.0.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/1b9cd7bc-b1a1-11e6-92f8-06caea5ac9f9.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,288,0,splunk,5,1,David Gold,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/protectwise,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

Activating Deep Discovery App

Go to Configuration > License
Specify a valid Activation Code. Use any valid Deep Discovery Inspector, Deep Discovery Email Inspector or Deep Discovery Analyzer Activation Code.
Click on the Activate button.

Deep Discovery App Configuration
To enable the app to process Deep Discovery Inspector, Deep Discovery Email Inspector and Deep Discovery Analyzer event logs:

Go to Configuration > App Set Up.
Specify name of the index; example ""index=ddi_index"".
Specify source type; example “sourcetype=tmef-*”.
Click Save.

Please refer to the online documentation for instruction on configuring the
app to enable Web Access Log Correlation.
Deep Discovery Product Configuration
Deep Discovery App assigns the source type “cefevents” to data entering Splunk
through TCP port 8080. Subsequently, the app assigns more granular source types
that start with “tmef-” to received data. The source types enable Splunk to
correctly format data during indexing and to perform more specific event
processing. If your network firewall prevents the Splunk server from receiving
data through port 8080, you must configure a new data input based on your
network policy. For example, typical syslog servers use UDP port 514.

Configuring Deep Discovery Inspector:


For v3.6 and 3.7, go to Logs > Syslog Server Settings; for v3.8, go to
     Administration > Integrated Products / Services > Syslog.

Welcome to Snort Alert for Splunk!
This app provides field extractions for Snort alert logs (fast and full) as well as dashboards, saved searches, reports, event types, tags and event search interfaces.
This app is maintained by Guillaume Pierre Fransen gfransen@splunk.com. Suggestions and bug reports are appreciated.
Thanks to Patrik Nordlén for developing the now archived ""Splunk for Snort"" app which this is inspired by. 
Installation
To install, extract the .spl file in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps
You will need to enable the appropriate inputs, either via inputs.conf, or through the Manager in the Splunk GUI. Splunk for Snort expects full alert logs to have a sourcetype of ""snort_alert_full"" and fast alert logs to have a sourcetype of ""snort_alert_fast"". Note that you don't need both types, any one will do - these distinctions are only there to make sure that Splunk parses the logs correctly. Sourcetypes are renamed to ""snort"" at search time, so if you do have both full and fast logs you won't need to worry about searching separately for each corresponding sourcetype.
For Splunk Cloud, refer to Install apps in your Splunk Cloud deployment. For customer managed deployments, refer to the standard methods for Splunk Add-on installs as documented for a Single Server Install or a Distributed Environment Install.
Using Splunk for Snort

Field extractions

The most basic feature provided by this app is to extract fields from Snort logs. The following fields are extracted for both full and fast:
* src_ip (Source IP address)
* dst_ip (Destination IP address)
* src_port (Source port)
* dest_port (Destination port)
* proto (Network protocol)
* generator_id (ID value of the Snort generator)
* signature (SID value of the signature)
* signature_rev (Signature revision)
* interface (Network interface)
* name (Signature name)
* category (Signature category)
* classification (Signature classification)
* priority (Signature priority)

The following fields are extracted for full only (as they are not available in fast):
* ttl (Packet TTL)
* tos (Type of Service)
* id (Unique ID for the event)
* iplen (Packet IP header length)
* dgmlen (Packet total length)
* bytes_in (Packet total length)

These field extractions are applied to all logs with sourcetype ""snort"" (which includes sourcetypes ""snort_alert_fast"" and ""snort_alert_full"" as they are renamed to ""snort"" at search time).

Snort event search

The app includes a custom search interface for Snort events, available under ""Snort event search"". This interface shows events tables and statistics for issued searches.

Dashboards and reports

A simple if-this-then-that workflow app to share Splunk alert and results
Simple to install, configure and run
This app is bundled together with a sample Splunk saved search that searches on failed login events. The search is triggered every 1 minute and looks for matching events in the relative past 1 minute

INSTALLATION STEPS

If you are installing this app manually, ensure this app is unpacked in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps
Go to the following Splunk app endpoint /manager/routr/apps/local/routr/setup?action=edit
Update the setup form with the appropriate oauth and access token credentials and click Save button
Verify that the scripts tweetalert.py or tumblralert.py is moved to $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/scripts accordingly if you configure either Twitter or Tumblr credentials
To confirm that this app has been successfully installed, simply copy the URL of your Splunk instance and load it in another browser. Then try with erroneous Splunk credentials in the login page
Go to your Twitter account page and you should see a tweet within a minute.
If you have configured your Tumblr credentials, go to your Tumblr page and you should see a Tumblr post

HOW TO USE THIS APP

Use tweetalert.py or tumblralert.py in the Alert actions when you create any Splunk Saved Search so that the alert will be posted as a tweet. To do this, Enable a script and provide the file name tweetalert.py or tumblralert.py in the Alert actions

HOW TO TROUBLESHOOT

Go to $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/routr.log This log file contains application specific information

With version >3.0.0 you need FIRST to create input(s) to point to your MISP instance(s)
and SECOND adapt all saved searches to add misp_instance=one-of-the-input-name
Overview
misp42splunk app connects one or several MISP instance(s) and your Splunk search head (cluster).
The app is designed to be easy to install, set up and maintain using the Splunk GUI.
Usage


MISP to SPLUNK (custom commands):
| mispgetioc misp_instance=default_misp _params_ | ... gets MISP event attributes into Splunk search pipeline.
| mispgetevent misp_instance=default_misp _params_ | ... gets MISP events into Splunk search pipeline using direct calls of the API. 
search ... |mispsearch misp_instance=default_misp field=myvalue | ... searches for matching attributes in MISP.
search ... |mispsight  misp_instance=default_misp field=myvalue | ... gets sighting information for a specific value (note that if there is FP, only first hit is returned)
 IMPORTANT  mispapireport has been replaced by mispgetioc (use json_request=)


MISP for SPLUNK: 2 Splunk alert actions are available          

one action to create new events or edit existing ones if you provide an eventid (or UUID). This allows to contribute to misp event(s) across several alert triggers.
one action to increment attribute sighting in a MISP instance.  

Installation
This app is designed to run on Splunk Search Head(s) on Linux plateforms (not tested on Windows but it could work)
1. Install the app on your Splunk Search Head(s): ""Manage Apps"" -> ""Install app from file""
2. At next logon, you should be invited to configure the app (if not go to Manage Apps > misp42 > launch app)
3. create at least one input for example ""default_misp"". Please note that mandatory fields ""intervals"" and ""index"" are not used. Just put a valid value
    - provide a name for example default_misp to follow the examples provided in this doc
    - provide the url to your MISP instance (version > 2.4.117)
    - provide the authkey,
    - check (or not) the certificate of the MISP server,
    - use (or not) the proxy for this instance,
    - provide client certificate if required (and check the box to use it)

4. If you need several instances, create additional inputs.
5. Important: Role(s)/user(s) using this app must have the capability to ""list_storage_passwords"" (as API KEYs and proxy password(s) are safely stored encrypted )
Use Cases
Build a dashboard
You may get fresh attributes from a MISP instance and save them under an index (for example index=misp).
Then a dashboard can be build by using this template. The result should be similar to this video
Thanks to @ran2 for sharing! 
Hunting in Splunk logs
Fresh IOC from MISP > saved searches in Splunk 
Creating (or editing) events based on automated sandboxing
If you have output of analysis pushed to Splunk you may automate the creation of events
Log on sandboxing output > saved search to qualify, sanitize (dedup remove top Alexa, etc.) and prepare the table (misp_, fo_, eo_ and no_) > set a splunk alert to create event(s) in MISP
 Only fields prefixed with misp_ (or fo_ for file objects, eo_ for email objects, no_ for network objects) are imported
 Advise: for objects, verify the name of the fields to be created Object definitions
* If you provide an eventid, that event is updated with attributes and objects instead of creating a new one. WARNING apparently the API does create duplicate objects if you submit sevral time the same inputs.
Sighting in MISP based on Splunk alerts
Search for attributes values/uuids in Splunk > alert to increment sighting counters (standard,false positive,expiration) in MISP for those values/uuids 
Saved searches and Enterprise Security App
Several saved searches are provided to easily create KV store lookups which can be used later. The default behaviour is to append new event attributes to the KV store but you may switch to replace it.
Based on those searches, you can easily created local CSV files and feed intel to Enterprise Security App.
you can also use this example (thanks @xg-simon for sharing):

The Cisco CMX Add-on for Splunk is used to gather data from CMX devices and do field extraction. 
REQUIREMENTS

Splunk version >= 6.3
If using a forwarder, it must be a HEAVY forwarder( we use the HF because the universal forwarder does not include python)
The forwarder system must have network access (HTTP/HTTPS) to one or more CMX devices which are to be Splunked.

Admin user ID and password for collecting data from CMX device.


Application can work on both Windows and Linux platforms


Recommended System configuration

Splunk forwarder system should have 4 GB of RAM and a quad-core CPU to run this app smoothly.

Topology and Setting up Splunk Environment

This app has been distributed in two parts.

1) Add-on app, which runs collector scripts and gathers data from CMX devices, does indexing on it and provides indexed data to the Main app.
  2) The main app, which receives indexed data from Add-on app, runs searches on it and builds a dashboard using indexed data.


This App can be set up in two ways:
  1) Standalone Mode: Install the main app and Add-on app on a single machine.

Here both the app resides on a single machine.
The main app uses the data collected by Add-on app and builds dashboard on it



2) Distributed Environment: Install the main app and Add-on app on search head, Only Add-on on forwarder system and indexes.conf file from Add-on bundle on Indexer.
 * Here also both the apps resides on search head machine, but no need to configure Add-on on search head.
 * Only Add-on needs to be installed and configured on forwarder system.
 * Execute the following command on forwarder to forward the collected data to the indexer.
   $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk add forward-server <indexer_ip_address>:9997
 * On Indexer machine, enable event listening on port 9997 (recommended by Splunk).
 * Main app on search head uses the received data and builds dashboards on it.

Installation of App


This app can be installed through UI using ""Manage Apps"" or extract zip file directly into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ folder.


After installation, go to the Apps->Manage Apps->Set up TA-CMX. New set up screen will open which will ask for CMX parameters, set appropriate parameters.


Please note, if you are using a self-signed certificate, set appropriate argument on the setup page.


Sample Event generation

This application bundles sample events which can be used for test purpose. To generate sample events, you will require Splunk_SA_Eventgen > 4.0.

Support

Email support will be provided as best effort.
CMX Connectors are supported by the CMX Cloud team at Cisco.
Cases can be opened by sending an email to cmx-cloud-support@external.cisco.com
Support requires a valid CMX installation and a CMX Advanced Licenses on applicable Access Points.
Cases can be opened 24x7

TEST YOUR INSTALL
The main app dashboard can take some time to populate the dashboards Once data collection is started. A good test to see that you are receiving all of the data we expect is to run this search after several minutes:
search `cmx_index` | stats count by sourcetype

In particular, you should see these sourcetypes:
 cmxhttp
 cmxanalytics
 cmxactive
 cmxmap
If you don't see these sourcetypes, check log file under $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/TA-CMX/tacmx.log.",Version 1.4,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/9d1087d2-1b99-11e7-af65-02f13bdc2585.png,"IT Operations, DevOps",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,410,0,splunk,5,1,Crest Data Systems,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/neha10,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

Welcome to SPLUNK MLB Stat v1.0
by Chern-Han (Henry) Ou
June 2011
hou@splunk.com
Overview
Splunk for MLB Stat provides the features:

MLB gameday events data analysis
Connect to MLB official gameday database then collect the game events and players' information since 2010
Game events data include spring training, regular season, all-star game, and playoffs
Query game events from all MLB games
Basic statistical numbers for any players, include hitter and pitcher
Plot and table for last 10 games performance
Rank or list the occurance of specific game events


MLB official RSS feed analysis
Collect news feed from official RSS site
Refresh the newest title and perform basic analysis
Provide links to various MLB and sports news websites



This app provides several python scripts to collect data from public source site automatically. Currently I only certified that the scripts can be run under unix/linux environment.
INSTALLATION

set the $SPLUNK_HOME environment variable to the install root of Splunk
data collection scripts is based on Python. Make sure that you have standard Python installed in the computer.
download app from splunkbase. You can download through 
Splunkbase
""Get more apps..."" in Splunk's homepage
If you download the MLB_stat.tar.gz directly, please uncompress it to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps



The installation will setup the scripts and related files into app's folder. However, I do not provide the sample data. Please download the sample data by yourself. Here are the instructions:

After uncompress the .tar.gz or installation from splunkbase, go to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/MLB_stat/bin
run ""python fetch_MLB_player_gameevent.py -verbose""
""python fetch_MLB_player_gameevent.py -help"" will list all available parameters



After installation, just remember to turn on MLB_stat app if it is not enabled by default.
INSTALLED COMPONENTS
Besides the necessary config files, Splunk for MLB stat will generate an index in order to distinguish the data fetched by this app and the others. The game events and players' basic information are all stored in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ML
B_stat/bin/datastore, and the news feed are all stored in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/MLB_stat/bin/RSS_log.
CREATING ADDITIONAL CONFIG FILES
If you want to create more config files such as make your own saved searches, just remember to turn the permission to ""APP"" so other users can use them if you want.
LIMITATIONS

If a game event contains muitlple plays, gameday log will seperate the events into event, event2, event3, etc. Right now I only handle the event field.
The pitching stat are usually affected by series of playes. It is difficult to recognize the pitchers' stat by analyzing single events. I am working on including boxscore data in order to perform more sabermetrics.
The fielding stat are even more difficult. In the game events, gameday does not record that who makes an error.
The game event parser is based on current gameday xml format. The parser only supports the gameday data after year of 2010.",Version 1.0.1,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/6c5fb38c-6900-11e3-b4de-005056ad5c72.png,Utilities,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,546,0,splunk,3,1,Henry Ou,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/ohb0312,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

After the add-on has been installed into Splunk and restarted, configure a data input through either of the following

from ""F1 2019 Add-on for Splunk"" app then ""Inputs"" tab
from Splunk main menu ""Settings"" then ""Data inputs""

Set the following values for the data input

Name of data input
UDP Port Number which by default is 20777 (same default as F1 2019 game)
Interval to a number (number is ignored by add-on)
Index for location of F1 data within Splunk

Note the IP address of the machine where the add-on is located. The IP address needs to be reached from the machine where the F1 2019 game is run from. The IP address of the machine may have a different internal IP address compared to the IP address that the machine can be reached on externally.
While a data input can receive data from multiple gaming rigs at the same time, there will be a point when the UDP packets will over whelm the single UDP port configured by the add-on. For multiple gaming rig set ups the preference should be for multiple data inputs with associated unique UDP port numbers.
F1 2019 Game Setup
To send telemetry from the F1 2019 game to the add-on goto ""Game Options"" then ""Settings"" then ""Telemetry Settings"", then set

UDP Telemetry to On
Broadcast Mode to Off
UDP IP Address to the IP address where the add-on is located
Port to same number used in add-on for ""UDP Port Number"" (default value is 20777)
UDP Send Rate to 10Hz
UDP Format to 2019 which is the default value

Message Description
The F1 2019 JSON messages created within Splunk are based on f1-2019-telemetry packets.py version 1.1.4 which in turn is based on Codemasters F1 2019 UDP Specification
JSON messages are created in the ""F1 2019"" format.
A single player will generate about 400KB of data per second ( at about 45 events per second ) when racing and telemetry is set to 10Hz.
Troubleshooting
From within Splunk the status of the add-on can be examined if access to the _internal index is available using the following SPL -
index=_internal ""[f1_2019_addon]""
Also if the add-on is working but not receiving data, please check that UDP data can be sent to the machine and port created within ""Data inputs"". For example running the following bash command line from the same machine where the add-on is installed will send a badly formed UDP message to the add-on -
echo -n ""test"">/dev/udp/localhost/20777
The badly formed UDP message can be found within Splunk using the following SPL -
index=_internal ""[f1_2019_addon]""
Within the returned results an event similar to below should be seen if the badly formed UDP message arrived successfully in Splunk -
Error unpacking UDP packet - Bad telemetry packet: too short (4 bytes)
The bash command line can be used to send a badly formed UDP message to remote machines and different ports, for example to send to remote machine example.com on port 20778 use -
echo -n ""test"">/dev/udp/example.com/20778
Viewing F1 2019 data
The F1 2019 App for Splunk is a minimal app that contains lookup tables and pre-canned dashboards to optionally view data generated from this add-on.
Alternatively use the following SPL to start exploring the data -
index=* sourcetype=codemasters:f1:2019:*
F1 2020
The add-on has also been tested successfully using a Playstation with Codemasters F1 2020 game when telemetry mode is set to F1 2019. Also, consider using the F1 2020 Add-on for Splunk if using the Codemasters F1 2020 game.",Version 2.0.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/e486e520-96f2-11ea-bea9-0a9c9ef27d38.png,Utilities,https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT,209,0,splunk,5,3,Splunk Works,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/splunklabs,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

OPEN SOURCE COMPONENTS AND LICENSES
Some of the components included in RiskSense Add-on for Splunk are licensed under free or open source licenses. We wish to thank the contributors to those projects.

croniter version 0.3.25 https://pypi.org/project/croniter/ (LICENSE https://github.com/kiorky/croniter/blob/master/docs/LICENSE)

RECOMMENDED SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

Splunk forwarder system should have 12 GB of RAM and a six-core CPU to run this Technology Add-on smoothly.

TOPOLOGY AND SETTING UP SPLUNK ENVIRONMENT
This Add-On can be set up in two ways:
1) Standalone Mode: Install the Add-on app on a single machine. This single machine would serve as a Search Head + Indexer + Heavy forwarder for this setup
2) Distributed Environment: Install Add-on on search head and Add-on on Heavy forwarder (for REST API).

Add-on resides on search head machine and accounts need to be configured here.
Add-on needs to be installed and configured on the Heavy forwarder system.
Execute the following command on Heavy forwarder to forward the collected data to the indexer.
  /opt/splunk/bin/splunk add forward-server <indexer_ip_address>:9997
On the Indexer machine, enable event listening on port 9997 (recommended by Splunk).
Add-on needs to be installed on search head for CIM mapping

INSTALLATION
Follow the below-listed steps to install an Add-on from the bundle:

Download the App package.
From the UI navigate to Apps->Manage Apps.
In the top right corner select Install app from file.
Select Choose File and select the App package.
Select Upload and follow the prompts.

UPGRADE
Follow the below steps when upgrading from RiskSense Add-on for Splunk

From the UI navigate to Apps->Manage Apps.
In the top right corner select Install app from file.
Select Choose File and select the App package.
Check the upgrade option.
Select Upload and follow the prompts.
Restart Splunk.

CONFIGURATION
Follow the below steps for configuring RiskSense Add-on for Splunk

From the Splunk Home Page, click on RiskSense Add-on for Splunk and navigate to the Configuration section.
In the Account tab, click on the Add button to configure a new Account.
Enter the required details like Account Name (To uniquely identify accounts in Splunk), RiskSense Platform URL, Client Name, and API Token.
The user can specify which clients to collect data for using a comma separated list of client names. If the user specifies 'All', then data for all of the clients will be collected.
Click on Save to save the configuration.
After an Account is configured, the user should navigate to the Input tab.
Click on the Add button to configure input for data collection.
Specify all required parameters needed to configure input like name, interval, index, Account, Type (Hosts/Apps), Filters and Page Size.
Filters can be specified in the format of field1=value1:OPERATOR1;field2=value2:OPERATOR2 and likewise.
If the specified filters are invalid, users will not be able to save the configuration.
Click on Save to save the input configuration.

TROUBLESHOOTING
The input and configuration pages are not loaded by the add-on

Check log file for possible errors/warnings: $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log

Account and input are configured but data doesn't appear in Splunk search or dashboards

One of the possible causes for this problem is when a user has selected a different index to collect data. Splunk by default searches inside the main index.
To add your custom index to default search, navigate to Settings -> Roles -> Select the role -> Click the indexes tab -> Search for you custom index -> Check the Default checkbox -> Save

Data is not getting collected in Splunk

Go to Search tab. Hit the following query index=""_internal"" sourcetype=""tarisksense:log"" and check the results.
Verify the filters configured during data collection are valid and such events exist on the platform.
Check to verify that the log file related to data collection is generated under $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/ta_risksense_risksense.log.
To get the detailed logs in the Splunk UI, navigate to RiskSense Add-on For Splunk. Click on Configuration and go to the Logging tab. Select the Log level to DEBUG.
Disable/Enable the input to re-collect the data.
Check the logs. They will be more verbose and will give the user insights on data collection.

Data for a particular client is not getting collected

Verify you have entered the client name in the Account configuration section.
If some client is added in the RiskSense platform after configuring account in Splunk, User needs to update that account with the new client name.

No client id found corresponding to given client name

Verify the client name entered is same as the client name available in the RiskSense platform.
If you don't have any clients configured in the Platform, you will need to configure one.

Error while configuring input

Verify the fields used in filters. The filters only work if API supports that particular field.
Check your configured API token has not been revoked the access to collect data.

If the Splunk Instance is behind a proxy, Configure Proxy settings by navigating to RiskSense Add-on for Splunk -> Configuration -> Proxy
UNINSTALL APP
To uninstall app, user can follow below steps:

SSH to the Splunk instance
Go to folder apps ($SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps)
Remove the TA-risksense folder from apps directory
Restart Splunk

You will also need the user credentials of the Carvoyant account that you want to pull data from. If you already have a Carvoyant connected car (or fleet!), simply use your Carvoyant account login.
If you need to purchase connectivity for your car or fleet, you can do so on our website http://www.carvoyant.com/splunk/.
Sandbox Access
The modular input currently available on splunkbase points to the Carvoyant production environment. We will be updating it to allow you to specifiy production or sandbox access in the future. For now, if you would like to test against the Carvoyant sandbox, please download a sandbox release from here.
Create a Data Input
Go into your Data Input configuration and add a new input of type ""Carvoyant Modular Input"". You will need the following information:

Collection Interval : Set this to the polling interval that you want data to be updated. If you leave this blank, the input will only run once. It's highly suggested that you make this 60 seconds or longer. Any less and you run the risk of a large query not completing before the next iteration.
Client Id : This is the client id from your Carvoyant developer account.
Client Secret : This is the secret for your client id.
Access Token : This is the OAuth2 access token granting your client id access to your Carvoyant account.
Refresh Token : This is the OAuth2 refresh token allowing Splunk to keep an active access token to your account
Expiration Date : This is the date that your access token expires (number of milliseconds from the Unix epoch). Set to 0 at creation and the MI will manage this for you.

After entering in your Client Id and Client Secret, you can select the ""Retrieve"" button to authenticate your Carvoyant user account and populate the access token, refresh token, and expiration date fields automatically.
Note: There is an issue in IE versions 8+ that will keep the Retrieve button from working properly. Please use an alternative browser to configure your modular input.
What to Expect
The first time the input runs, no data will be pulled. This will set the initial query point within the Carvoyant system. If you need to pull historical data into your Splunk system, that will need to be done outside of this MI. Contact us at support@carvoyant.com if you are looking for options to do so.
After the first initialization call, any new data elements on any vehicle in your account will be added to splunk. The specific types of data will depend upon what data your individual vehicles collect.
If your vehicles are stored on multiple accounts, you will need to create an input for each account that contains vehicles you want to pull. If all of your vehicles are on a single account, then one input will pull all of your data.
Note: This input makes use of an API call against Carvoyant that will return the most recent data collected since the last call to the authorized account and using the specified client id. You should not configure multiple data inputs (even on different Splunk instances) using the same client id and Carvoyant account. If you need to access the same Carvoyant account from multiple systems you will need a dedicated client id for each.

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5547,2022-01-10,07:35:02 AM,Jira Tracking Add On for Splunk,,"June 16, 2021","Introduction:
This is an add-on powered by the Splunk Add-on Builder. Uses Atlassian Jira REST API v3 service to collect Issues and Worklogs from a Jira Cloud Server.
A new event is indexed every time an issue or worklog is updated or created.
Jira Issues events contains every navigable field, including the following fields/information:
    Issue Summary
    Issue Creator Name
    Issue Assigne Name
    Issue Reporter Name
    Aggregate Time Spent
    Customfields
Jira Worklogs events contains every navigable field, including the following fields/information:
    Worklog Update Author
    Worklog Update Date
    Worklog Time Spent (in hours and seconds)
Prerequisites:
Requires a Jira Cloud server and an account with privileges to get issues and worklogs information.
Architecture:
Based on a standard app created with Splunk Add-On Builder. Consists in two modular inputs that collects issues and worklogs using a python3 script that implements the Jira REST API service requests with the collection queries.
Contains two distinct sourcetypes:
    atlassian:jira:issues
    atlassian:jira:worklogs
Contains fields aliases for the “id” field because “id” is the identification field in issues and in worklogs.
Installation:
Extract the app to your apps directory, and then restart the Splunk instance.
Create a new index to store this new data.
In the Splunk apps menu you can access the TA settings, it allows you to create and configure data inputs (one for issues and one for worklogs). Its required to set a Jira server url, user account, API token.
Warning: the checkbox “Restart checkpoint” was implemented for debug purposes. It deletes the actual checkpoint reindexing all the data again from the begining. Use with caution.
Common use cases:
Our internal use case consists in a single instance Splunk Enterprise server with a custom dashboard that tracks Jira worklogs data, showing user participation, total time spend, etc, by issues or projects.
Developement:
Currently there are no plans to expand the collection to more Jira data and the custom dashboard is still in early developement and not included in this TA.

System Requirements: This app is mostly tested on Splunk 6.4.1
Installation:
Installation for this app requires installing the App from Splunkbase only. 
Note: In a distributed environment, you will need to create an index called peerreview on your indexer.
Configuration:
There are two lookup tables in this app:
peer_review.csv - this file contains a list of user, group, semester, and class. 
peer_review_questions.csv - this file contains a list of questions for each class and semester. 
To configure these lookups, ensure that the ""user"" field matches up with valid user accounts in your Splunk environment. The dashboards in this app will use that user account to generate the various content. 
Flow of the app:
There are three main pages in this app:

The first view in this app displays any pending reviews based on the content of the lookup tables. Any pending reviews will give you the option to ""Click Here to Review"" which will take you to a second view. 
The second view will give you a specific user id and any questions you need to answer about that user. You will be given the option to ""Click Here to Review"" those questions. 
Finally, you will be taken to a page to answer the specific question about that user. 

All data from the questions that have been reviewed will go into the index=peerreview. There you can perform analysis on the data and be able to use that to score team members.",Version 1.0.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/image/default_icon.png,Utilities,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/,145,0,splunk,5,1,Ryan O'Connor,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/ryanoconnor,"Products: Splunk Enterprise

Data Utilization is a critical tool that you should use to keep your Splunk environment healthy and to gain a deeper understanding of how your data is being used. Data Utilization provides a UI that displays data sources sorted by license usage with the number of queries that data is used in. You can use Data Utilization to identify which data sources are impacting your license as well as determining your most active data sources within your Splunk environment. 
Key Features
- See how many of your Datasets or Data Ingest is not being utilzied by Users
- Tracks utilization of Ad-hoc Searches, Scheduled Queries, and Dashboard searches
- Set your own threshold for Utilization, and view utilization by Index, Index-Source Type, and Index-Source Type-Source
- Further investigate each Data Set to view who is searching the data and how
- Intuitive user interface that displays data sources sorted by license usage with associated information about how the data source is being used in your Splunk environment.

Therefore, Splunk only provides support for a Spark cluster that is deployed using the Splunk DFS Manager app. If you install your Spark cluster manually, Splunk isn't responsible for support or maintenance of the compute cluster.
For information on installing and configuring the app for Splunk DFS Manager, see Splunk Docs.
Application Details

Supported Splunk Enterprise: 8.0
Supported Spark version: 2.3.3

Installation Instructions
You can use the app irrespective of your deployment scenario and install Spark on a standalone search head, standalone indexer, search head cluster, or an indexer cluster. The Splunk DFS Manager app must be installed on the search head and all the search peers that are a part of the DFS deployment. In a search head cluster, the app must be installed on all the search heads. In an indexer cluster, the app must be deployed to all the members of the indexer cluster using the cluster master node. Ensure that the app binaries are available on the required DFS search heads and the search peers that you want to use as DFS workers.
Supported topologies and installation paths:
- Search head clusters: $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/shcluster
- Indexer clusters: $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/master-apps and then bundled push to: $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps
- Standalone search head: $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps
- Indexers: $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps
Troubleshooting:
Following are some of the common issues that you may see while using the Splunk DFS Manager app:
- Splunk DFS Manager UI does not load
- DFS master or DFS worker does not start
- Removing or adding DFSworker fails
For more information on troubleshooting error messages, see Splunk DFS Manager Error Messages.
Getting Help:

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) technologies provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by network hardware and applications. Oftentimes this is done through the 'scraping' of end-system log files, which are then filtered, analyzed, and prepared for easy consumption by security administrators.  In general, SIEM tools excel at the detection and reporting of threats, vulnerabilities, and security events - but are limited in their ability to provide real-time mitigation. SailPoint IdentityIQ, with its built-in suite of enterprise application connectors, can alleviate this shortcoming. A symbiotic relationship has been identified, whereby a SIEM tool can detect security issues in near real-time and then provide the necessary information to IdentityIQ which can then mitigate the threat.
SailPoint has developed an official Splunk® Verified adaptive response ‘add-on’ for Splunk® Enterprise Security. This add-on contains a complete catalogue of pre-defined alert actions that map directly to the functionality provided by the IdentityIQ SIEM Plugin. When combined, the SailPoint Adaptive Response Add-on and the IdentityIQ SIEM Plugin provide a powerful integration between IdentityIQ and Splunk® that can:

Gather and display IdentityIQ AuditEvents and SyslogEvents in Splunk
Initiate identity, application, or entitlement based certifications
Automatically disable or remove access from identities
Disable or remove access from identities with additional approval steps

The add-on also provides a way to retrieve all task results within Splunk®. It utilizes IdentityIQ API built upon the RESTful SCIM2.0 to achieve this.
Additionally, the add-on also provides two (3) new source types with in Splunk®. 
SailPoint Syslog Events: Used to collect Syslog events from IdentityIQ
SailPoint Audit Events: Used to collect Audit events from IdentityIQ
SailPoint Task Results: Used to collect Task results from IdentityIQ
Once ingested into Splunk® these events can be used to populate a custom dashboard visualizing the data.
NOTE: For Task Results Data Input, there are rare chances of having duplicate records. In order to get distinct events while performing search- ‘dedup’ command can be used as a search reference. This commands removes duplicate results based on one field. We would recommend to use field ‘id’ for this commands. Events returned by dedup are based on search order.
https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/SearchReference/dedup
Eg: sourcetype=“sailpoint_identityiq_task_results”| dedup id | stats count
Requirements
Full functionality requires the following:

IdentityIQ 7.1 or higher
IdentityIQ SIEM Plugin installed
Splunk® Enterprise Security (8.0+)

Process Overview


A Splunk®-monitored system logs an anomaly
Splunk® detects anomaly and creates an Alert, utilizing a SailPoint Adaptive Response alert action
The SailPoint Adaptive Response Add-on action makes POST request to IdentityIQ SIEM Plugin endpoint
Endpoint creates IdentityIQ Alert object and SIEM plugin table entry
SIEM Plugin Service examines alert, and initiates provisioning request or creates certification for LDAP group
Access provided by membership of LDAP group is disabled/removed in the monitored secure system

This supporting add-on provides an external lookup called sslcert_lookup to collect the attributes of an SSL cert at a given address and port. It is built on the Splunk SDK.
Possible use-cases:
- Enrich ip addresses in a search with a certificate's common name (ssl_subject_common_name) or the certificate's subject alternative name (ssl_subject_alt_name) to gain intelligence of what might be the endpoint of the ip at that current time.
- Using makeresults or inputlookup commands, monitor a set of IPs or hostnames for expiring certs and alert
- Using the collect command to store a history of certificate changes
Version: 1.1.0

Using this Technology Add-on:
Setup:
Please see Splunk's official documentation for the initial installation of the add-on.
After installation, you may be prompted to proceed to the set-up screen in order to configure the app. Alternatively, this page may be accessed by navigating to the app management screen and selecting the 'Set up' action associated with the Rapid7 Add-On.
On the set-up screen, the following details must be entered:

Nexpose username
Nexpose password
Nexpose address (IP or hostname)
Nexpose port

The application records the latest scan for a site when importing data. This means that whenever the script runs, it has the option of only importing data if a new scan exists. To enable this behaviour, tick the checkbox labelled ""Import data only when a new scan exists"". If this option is not enabled, asset and vulnerability data will be imported even if a new scan has not occurred since the last time the script executed. 
The application also offers the option to import a limited amount of solution information along with each vulnerability. To enable this behavior, tick the checkbox labelled Import solution data with vulnerabilities. If this option is enabled, a solution summary, number of related solutions and the solution type(s) will be included with each vulnerability event.
You may notice that some vulnerabilities have no solution data - this is because there is no solution available that is relevant for that particular asset, based on its operating system etc.

recent release (v1.2.0) it is now necessary to create the index prior to configuring the modular inputs. Following the
Splunk instructions for Creating a Custom Index
and name it rapid7 in order to leverage the default index name used while configuring the inputs. 
This step can be skipped if an index has already been created for data imported by the Nexpose Technology Add-On.
Adding a modular input:
In order for the application to index data, you must create a modular input job and specify the IDs of the sites for which data will be imported.
Under Settings>Data inputs>Rapid7 Nexpose choose the 'New' option to create a job. By default, data will be written to the ‘rapid7’ index. To set a custom index, expand the ‘More settings’ panel and change the ‘Index’ value. 
Assets and Vulnerabilities:
When creating a job for importing asset and vulnerability info, select the 'Assets and Vulnerabilities' option for the 'Job Type'. 
If you wish to import asset and vulnerability data only for specific sites, enter their site IDs (separated by commas) within the 'Sites' box. Leaving this box blank will import data for all sites.
You may create multiple jobs for importing asset and vulnerability information, containing different site IDs. It is recommended to split large sites into individual, staggered jobs.
Vulnerability Exceptions:
To import vulnerability exception information, select the 'Vulnerability Exceptions' option for the 'Job Type'. This will import data for all vulnerability exceptions and therefore it is not necessary to enter site IDs.
Vulnerability exceptions are imported regardless of whether the app is set to only import new scans or not. 
Module details:
Vulnerability Information:
All Rapid7 Vulnerability data will conform to the Splunk Vulnerability Common Information Model. All Rapid7 vulnerability data events will have the source 'Rapid7_Nexpose_Splunk_Vulnerability_Data' and will have a sourcetype of 'rapid7:nexpose:vuln'. 
All fields with multiple values will be separated with a semicolon e.g. a vulnerability with more than one vulnerability category related to it (Apache, Apache HTTP Server, IAVM, Web) will have a Splunk CIM field vulnerabilities.dest value of ‘Apache;Apache HTTP Server;IAVM;Web’. 
These fields are limited to 1250 characters. If such a field has been truncated, the field's value will end with an ellipsis (""...""). 
Asset Information:
All Rapid7 Asset data will conform to the Splunk Vulnerability Common Information Model. All Rapid7 vulnerability data events will have the source 'Rapid7_Nexpose_Splunk_Asset_Data' event and will have a sourcetype of 'rapid7:nexpose:asset'. 
All fields with multiple values will be separated with a semicolon e.g. an asset with multiple services running on it (CIFS, DCE Endpoint Resolution, DCE RPC, Microsoft Remote Display Protocol, SSH) will have a Splunk CIM field inventory.services value of 'CIFS;CIFS Name Service;DCE Endpoint Resolution;DCE RPC;Microsoft Remote Display Protocol;SSH’.
These fields are limited to 1250 characters. If such a field has been truncated, the field's value will end with an ellipsis (""...""). 
Vulnerability Exception Information:
Vulnerability exception data events will be have the source 'Rapid7_Nexpose_Vulnerability_Exception_Data' event and will have a sourcetype of 'rapid7:nexpose:vulnexception'.
Debugging:
Two log files are available to help debug issues contained within <splunk_home>/var/log/splunk/:

splunkd.log - Splunk general log
TA-rapid7_nexpose.log - Log for the Rapid7 Technology Add-on

Splunk versions:
Splunk 4.0 and higher
Platforms:
Windows Vista, 7, 2008 with Powershell 1.0 installed
SCOM versions:
Tested on SCOM 2007 R2 and later. The add-on has no known dependencies on R2, so it should work with R1. The legacy MOM environment is not supported.
We recommend that the add-on be installed on the SCOM root server.
Powershell requirements
Powershell 1.0 must be installed and the SCOM Powershell snap-in must be registered. Registration happens automatically when the SCOM operations console is installed.
NOTE: By default Powershell has a security policy enabled that restricts execution of user scripts from the command line. To overcome this, we change the execution policy to the less restricted RemoteSigned mode each time the Powershell script is called. See http://ss64.com/ps/set-executionpolicy.html for more information.
Support
This add-on is community suported. This means that there's no formal support from Splunk available for this add-on, but free support is available on Splunk Answers and questions, bug reports, and feature requests will be addressed on a best-effort basis by the add-on's author or other community members.

Installation

Install Splunk if it's not already installed. 
Using the download button on this page, download and save the scom.tar.gz file. 
Decompress the add-on (it's compressed in .tar.gz format so you'll need a tool like 7Zip to decompress) and place the extracted scom folder into %PROGRAMFILES%\Splunk\etc\apps
Start or restart your Splunk instance (you can use the splunk restart command or the GUI)
Navigate to the Splunk GUI (usually http://localhost:8000/) and log in if needed
Select Manage Apps from the App menu, OR go to Manager>Apps.
Open Splunk Add-on For SCOM.
Fill in the user settings on the add-on's setup page.

Configuration
The add-on provides a setup page to configure SCOM-specific settings like SCOM hostname, polling interval, and inputs. This info is then written to bin\scom_client.xml. The powershell scripted input reads its configuration from this file each time it starts up.
You can select whether to enable or disable forwarding for all events and/or alerts from the SCOM database. If the checkbox is selected, the script will request all events/alerts starting with the very first event/alert and forward those to Splunk. When the script reaches the most recent event/alert, it will switch to polling mode; in polling mode, the script waits for new events/alerts and forwards them as soon as they become available. No events/alerts filtering is available through the setup screen-- you can either get all events/alerts or none.
How it works

SCOM -> Splunk event and alert data forwarding is done using two PowerShell comandlets, which are part of OpsMgr Powershell library (""Snap-in"") that ships with the OpsMgr. Once executed in the Powershell environment, these comandlets (Get-Alert and Get-Event) print out events and alerts to the console. 
We implement a powershell script scom_client.ps1 that:
Imports the SCOM snap-in
Reads config data (SCOM hostname, selected type of input(alerts and/or events) and SCOM polling interval)
Establishes a connection with local or remote SCOM server
Enters a loop polling SCOM for events starting with the latest imported event
Formats the output to look more Splunk-friendly and prints it to the console


The script keeps track of the timestamp and GUID of the last event forwarded by saving this information to a file. If the script is stopped or interrupted, it will resume indexing from where it was when it got interrupted.

Performance
Our tests showed a throughput of about 3,000 events/min on a Xeon 3Ghz/4Gb Win2008 with full SCOM and Splunk installed at the same machine. The Powershell client process consumed around 3Gb of RAM while 800,000 events were being forwarded; the average CPU usage was 25%.
Remote execution
As mentioned above, we recommend that the add-on be executed on the same box as the SCOM root server. If you do need to run it remotely:

The add-on can only run on Windows Vista, 7, or 2008, with Powershell 1.0 installed.
If you want to run it remotely, it's recommended that the SCOM operations console be installed on the remote box to make sure the Powershell snap-in is registered in GAC. Alternatively, a few steps need to be taken as described here: http://derekhar.blogspot.com/2007/07/operation-manager-command-shell-on-any.html
You need to add the user account under which the script will be running to the SCOM Administrators list. To do this, in the SCOM management console go to Administration -> Security / User Roles, right-click on Operations Manager Administrators, and select Properties. Click Add and select the group that the remote user belongs to.

Field names
Mapping of SCOM field names to Splunk field names is hardcoded in the scom_client.ps1 script, but can be easily modified as needed in that script.
Below is the full field mapping for alerts:

What's New In This Release?

Small code tweaks and enhancements
New 'File Config Quest' dashboard allows you to navigate the directory structure on any or all your Splunk hosts remotely and compare files and view configurations.

Overview
Config Quest is an awesome lightweight utility from Discovered Intelligence for searching and reviewing Splunk configurations on any Splunk server directly from your search head! Use Config Quest to search for any stanza or configuration parameter, in any selected app, across any Splunk server in your environment.
At the heart of the app are several a powerful dashboards that enable the searching of Splunk configurations by conf file, host, app, stanza and/or parameter. Configurations returned are nicely formatted into the familiar stanza, parameter and value Splunk conf file format, along with text based highlighting to aid visualization and readability. There are dashboards for reviewing configuration changes, finding configuration differences, comparing configurations between hosts and identifying installed application differences.
New! You can now also use Config Quest to navigate through the file system across all your Splunk servers remotely, compare files and perform one-click config quests on conf files!
Why is this app useful?
You can use Config Quest to:
- Instantly search for Splunk configurations across any Splunk server in your environment from one place
- Search for configurations by host, wildcard host, conf file, app, stanza and/or parameter
- Identify configuration differences across all your similar Splunk servers (e.g. all indexers)
- Compare configurations on one host with those of another
- Identify all installed applications and application installation differences across your Splunk deployment
- Centrally review your serverclass.conf and view the serverclasses and apps, along with the deployment clients that have been assigned the serverclasses
- Navigate directory structure of your local or remote Splunk hosts 
Why not just use btool?
Config Quest does not replace btool, but instead provides a convenient mechanism to remotely review configurations residing on your Splunk servers, without the need to log into the host and run btool or check files manually. There are no scripts to run, no complex logic to learn and nothing to install other than this app on your Search Head. While btool rolls up configurations using Splunk's inheritance based rules, the configs returned by Config Quest are in their raw state prior to rollup, although some defaults are picked up in the results.
How Does It work?
The app leverages Splunk's REST based commands, then uses complex formatting and logic to present the data in a familiar Splunk Conf file format by stanza, parameter and value.
Are there dashboards/reports?
Yes, there are six dashboards as follows:
- Current Config Quest - allows for centralized searching and reviewing configurations across all your Splunk servers
- Difference Config Quest - helps you to find differences in specific configurations across your similar Splunk servers
- Comparison Config Quest - allows you to compare the configuration on one host with that of another host for a specific Splunk conf file
- Application Config Quest - helps you to identify application installation differences across your Splunk servers
- Serverclass Config Quest - allows for remote interogation of your Serverclass.conf, presenting a similar view to the deployment server and lists all serverclasses, apps and the deployment clients associated with the various serverclasses. Note: For this to work, you must add your deployment server(s) as search peers.
- File Config Quest - allows you to navigate the directory structure on any or all your Splunk hosts remotely and compare files and view configurations
Important Stuff
Requirements:
- Only tested to work on Splunk 6.5 and above
- Splunk servers that you want to view configurations from must be added as search peers to the search head that the app is install on
- If you are looking for the configs in system/local or default - choose the 'system' app from the Current Config Quest dashboard
How do I install this?
The app is super simple to install.
1. Download the app from Splunkbase
2. Install the app on a search head or search head cluster.
3. Restart Splunk - this is because we have a small amount of JS that helps to colour format configurations
4. Go to the app and start your config quest!
Additional step if you have installed Splunk in a different path to the default Splunk install path for your OS:
5. Update the macro named ""file_quest_os"" in the Config Quest app and modify the Splunk home path to the path of your install. For example, if you installed Splunk on Linux in /app/splunk, then update the Linux section of the macro from ""Linux,%2Fopt%2Fsplunk"" to ""Linux,%2Fapp%2Fsplunk""
Additional step if you are running Splunk on Windows to change the default OS on the File Config Quest:
6. Firstly, do not update the dashboard directly. Update the macro named ""file_quest_default"" in the Config Quest app and modify the OS to either Windows, Linux or Mac. Please do not deviate from these values.

Future Release
The following items are planned for a future release. Let us know if you would like us to add something!
- Historic conf file analysis - the ability to archive configurations and then reference old configurations and compare against current configurations
Q&A
Any useful support questions and answers will be posted here for others to view
Q. Where would you recommend installing this?
A. Typically this application would be installed on the same Search Head that you do your operational reporting from. However, it can be installed on any Search Head, including Search Heads in Splunk Cloud.
Q. The Difference Config Quest seems to take a long time to run
A. If your environment is large, then broad, unfiltered configuration searches may take a small amount of time to run depending on the configuration file selected and number of hosts you have, but it will complete if you are patient.
Q. I am seeing both local and default configurations being returned
A. Correct, default configurations will be returned when there is no local or app specific configuration taking precedence. There is currently no way to identify whether the configuration presented is in local or default - this is mostly due to the REST API not returning this data.
Q. This application says install only on a SH or SH Cluster but I would like to install this on my Splunk Cloud IDM (Intermediate Data Manager) is this ok?
A. Yes, Config Quest will function perfectly well on the Splunk Cloud IDM instance and allow you to see details of the configurations for your add-ons and apps installed on the IDM server.
Q. I installed Splunk in /app/splunk instead of /opt/splunk and File Config Quest dashboard is returning an error. 
A. If you installed Splunk in a different location to the default for either Windows or Linux, you will need to update the macro named ""file_quest_os"" in the Config Quest app and modify the Splunk home path to the path of your install, following the same syntax in the macro.
Q. I have a Windows install of Splunk but the new File Config Quest dashboard is defaulting to Linux. Can I change this without updating the dashboard code?
A. Yes, please avoid updating the dashboard directly with a new default as this will make support and future upgrades a lot more challenging. Instead, there is a macro named ""file_quest_default"" within the Config Quest app, where you can modify the default OS to either Windows, Linux or Mac.",Version 3.0.2,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/724bf9ac-0a5d-11ec-9ec0-e61862c005bb.png,Utilities,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,"2,644",0,splunk,5,12,Discovered Intelligence,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/DiscoveredIntel,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

written by Rui Ataide
This software is provided ""as is"" without express or implied warranty or support
=== Splunk for RSA Security Analytics ===
This Splunk app will connect to a RSA Security Analytics Concentrator/Broker via REST API.
 It will poll the RSA Security Analytics device regularly to collect new session meta data based on the provided query.
To install:
   - Extract to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/
   - Reconfigure as per below
     -> If deploying on a Splunk Windows a good LAST_MID_FILE value for Windows is LAST_MID_FILE = 'c:\.last_mid.query'
   - Restart Splunk
The following Splunk search will provide any relevant error logs for this app:
index=_* nwsdk_query.py sourcetype=""splunkd""
Make sure the REST interface is enabled on your RSA Security Analytics device.
To troubleshoot connections to your RSA Security Analytics device use:
   curl -u user:password ""http://serverip:50103/sdk?msg=summary&id1=0&id2=0&size=2000&force-content-type=text/plain""
Configure the following variables in nwsdk_query.conf.
 Make sure you place it in  < app >/local/nwsdk_query.conf to avoid overwrite during app upgrades:
# top_level_url = http://192.168.160.33:50105/
Authentication is now using Splunk PassAuth capability, in order to configure credentials go to ""Manage Apps"" > ""netwitness_query"" > Setup
 Enter your RSA Security Analytics credentials and click ""Save"".
Alternatively the following can still be used in the configuration file as a back if credentials aren't passed through from Splunk. This
 is to maintain backwards compatibility.
# username = admin
   # password = netwitness
The TOP_LEVEL_URL is the URL to access your RSA Security Analytics device REST interface,
 the other two variables are self-explanatory.
# query = select * where service=0
The NW_QUERY parameter selects what data should be imported from the NextGen deployment.
 You can specify only one query per configuration file but you can use different files and configure mutliple inputs.
 If you need to configure multiple inputs used different configuration files and pass them as an argument.
The following options can be left as they are on most *nix & Mac OS X systems,
 but you can also reconfigure them for your environment:
   # last_mid_file = /tmp/.last_id.OTHER
If you use multiple configurations each will require a different LAST_MID_FILE for each.
== HASHING ==
For privacy and compliance reasons any key can now be replaced by its MD5 cryptographic hash value (e.g. cc.number).
 A new section [hashing] was created for this. In it add your hash mappings in the format: < nw meta name >=< prefix splunk field name >,< prefix length >
 if no prefix necessary use length 0 and any random prefix name both values are required. See example below:
[hashing]
   cc.number=cc_bin,6
The above example will replace credit card numbers with their corresponding MD5 hash and will extract the credit card first 6 digits (BIN) to a new field
 named cc_bin. 
== ADDITIONAL MAPPINGS ==
If you would like to add your own mappings for RSA Security Analytics meta data to Splunk fields or change the default map for your environment. 
 Create a new section [mappings] on your copy of nwsdk.conf and add as many mappings as required, one per line in the form of
 < nw meta name >=< splunk field name > as per example below.
# Additional mappings should be added below in the form of < nw meta name >=< splunk field name >
   [mappings]

Set up alerts with this app the same way you set up any other alert, making sure to choose the ""Twitter"" option for when the alert is triggered. Bear in mind that you can use fields from the alerting message (e.g. $result.user$ for the user field) to build your tweet.
Notes
Twitter does limit how often you can post to its API, so if you make too many attempts at once, you will be throttled by Twitter, and there's not a whole lot we can do about it.

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5532,2022-01-10,07:36:35 AM,Ivanti IDAC Add-On for Splunk,,"May 6, 2021","Overview
Ivanti have developed an integration for IDAC and Splunk to provide details of block, shadowing, admin audit and agent check-in activity.
This Technology Add-On (TA) provides the props.conf properties required to parse both json and Windows event log-based inputs to use with the corresponding IDAC Splunk app.
An accompanying app - the Ivanti IDAC App for Splunk (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5533/) provides dashboards that visualise the retrieved data .
Requirements
The add-on was developed and tested against IDAC 5.3, but should support ingestion of logs from any version of IDAC that supports SIEM logging using adc_alp_[32|64].dll
Installation
For ingestion of IDAC event data, install the TA where Splunk will first parse incoming data - heavy forwarders, or indexers if logs are being sent directly from a Splunk Universal Forwarder.
Install the Ivanti IDAC App for Splunk on search heads for dashboards and CIM-compliant field aliases.
Configuration
To enable SIEM logging on the IDAC server, follow Ivanti's documented instructions (https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/Syslog-and-Windows-Event-Log-redirection-to-a-3rd-party-SIEM?language=en_US) - or the abridged version that follows.
Take the architecture-specific DLL (adc_alp_32.dll or adc_alp_64.dll) from one of the following two locations in the product installation folders, depending on whether you want to log to a flat file (json) or Windows event log ('wel'):

DeviceAndApplicationControl <n.n>\ext\siem\wel
DeviceAndApplicationControl <n.n>\ext\siem\json

Copy the relevant DLL to the location where IDAC's service (sxs.exe) is running, for example: c:\windows\syswow64. If using json logging, create a configuration file (example below) and restart the service.
Example configuration file - named adc_alp_<architecture>.config and located in the same folder as adc_alp_[architecture].dll:
{
  ""folder"": ""c:\\IDAC_logs"",
  ""filename"":
  {
    ""prefix"": ""IDAC_Log_"",
    ""extension"": ""json""
  }
}
As per Ivanti's documented guidance, 'There is no cleaning done by the DLL, the consumer will need to take care of deleting the files when processed'.
To ingest logs, deploy an inputs.conf to an IDAC server with monitor stanzas for either the Application event log or the file path if using json-based logging. Example (disabled) inputs.conf entries are provided in the TA's /defaults folder, and shown (enabled) below:
[monitor://C:\idac_logs\*.json]
disabled = 0
index = idac
sourcetype = ivanti:idac:json

[WinEventLog://Application]
renderXml = 1
disabled = 0
start_from = oldest
current_only = 0
whitelist = SourceName=""idac_siem_sxs""
sourcetype = ivanti:idac:wel
source=ivanti:idac:wel:application
index = idac
Notes:
 Ensure that the target index is correct - if 'idac' doesn't exist, then create it or choose a different index.
 If already ingesting the Application event log from the IDAC server, the use of transforms.conf may be required on a Heavy Forwarder or indexer to dynamically reassign the sourcetype to ivanti:idac:wel
For further guidance around ingestion refer to the Splunk 'Getting Data In' (https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Data/Getstartedwithgettingdatain) or Cloud-focused GDI documentation (https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/latest/Admin/IntroGDI).
Troubleshooting

Confirm events are being logged locally on the IDAC server. If no event log files (json) or events (Windows event log option) are generated, try using Sysinternals' Process Monitor to confirm adc_alp_*.dll is loaded into sxs.exe. If necessary, engage Ivanti Support. 
Confirm the Splunk Universal Forwarder is installed on the IDAC server, has an inputs.conf stanza configured to monitor the correct json log file location - or the local Application event log.
Confirm that events are being received by Splunk from the IDAC server - by checking the _internal index for values from the IDAC host, if nothing is appearing the IDAC target index

Overview
This application uses fields defined in the Common Information Model to harvest and display details about network traffic dropped by firewalls.  This is useful for base lining and monitoring the traffic required by applications running in protected networks (servers in a DMZ, critical systems within electronic security perimeters, etc.).  
If you have the Splunk Add-on for Cisco ASA installed, the dashboards in this application will display information about traffic dropped by Cisco ASA, Cisco PIX, and Cisco Firewall Service Module devices without any additional configuration.
Prerequisites
The following pre-requisites are required:


Firewalls you wish to monitor using the dashboards in this application must be configured to send event data about dropped traffic to Splunk.    


Field extractions must exist for the following CIM defined fields: host, src_ip, dest_ip, dest_port, transport, and action.  


Field extractions for Cisco ASA, PIX, and Firewall Service Module firewalls are available by installing the Splunk Add-on for Cisco ASA (https://apps.splunk.com/app/1620/).  Extractions for devices from other manufacturers may be added to this application in future versions, or made available by other Splunk Add-ons or Technology Adapters.


Installation
To install this app, download the file compressed tar file for the most recent version from http://www.synacktek.com/dropped-traffic.  Save this file on your system, then load it onto your Splunk server(s) by choosing Apps / Manage Apps / Install app from file.  
Click the Choose File button, and find the installation archive file you downloaded from www.synacktek.com, then click the Upload button to install the app.
Configuration
By default, the application dashboards are configured to look events that have action=blocked for the sourcetypes cisco:asa, cisco:fwsm, and cisco:pix.  If you are using different sourcetype names for your data you will need to modify the dashboard to accommodate this.
To modify the sourcetypes used by the dashboard, open the SYNACKTEK Dropped Traffic Dashboard and select Edit Source from the Edit menu in the upper-right corner of the screen.
Once the source XML is open, find the query field and modify the list of sourcetypes being queried to match what you need for your environment.  Click the Save button when your changes are complete.
Note that you can make other changes to the search criteria by editing the XML source as well.  If you want to exclude events from specific hosts, for example, you could add the text NOT host=HOST_TO_BE_REMOVED in the query field.
Use Cases
The dashboards included in this application are designed for hardening and monitoring secure systems within your larger enterprise network; security zones where you can quantify the expected inbound and outbound traffic you should see traversing your security boundaries.  
Events generated by security devices connected to the public Internet may generate a lot of noise and reduce the effectiveness of the dashboards; you may need to modify the dashboards to omit events from edge devices.
The following are some specific use cases this where this application can be best used:
System Hardening – When implementing a new system in a secured environment it can be difficult to identify all the traffic that needs to be white-listed in your security devices.  More often than not, this becomes a trial-and-error process that requires security engineers to monitor traffic attempting to traverse a firewall, then either adding policies to permit the traffic or disabling the unneeded services which are generating the traffic.  The dashboards provided in this application make it easy to find traffic being dropped by source, destination, or frequency so it can be addressed.
NERC CIP ESP Monitoring – ICS and Control Center networks used to support NERC CIP assets for electrical utilities require comprehensive monitoring to detect unexpected traffic.  Luckily, the traffic footprints in these environments can be made very predictable.  By capturing events from your electronic access points and displaying them in the dashboards provided by this app you can quickly detect unauthorized traffic and determine its source.
Misconfiguration / Malicious Traffic Detection – Once your secure systems and security policies are normalized, you should see very little unexpected traffic being dropped by your security devices.  Spikes in dropped traffic are typically either an indication of a misconfigured device, or the result of malicious traffic trying to cross your security boundaries.  These spikes are easy to identify using the dashboards provided in this app. 
To Do List
The following is a list of updates we plan to make available to users of this application in the future:
-   Provide field extractions (or links to other technology adapters) for additional network security devices

Addition of a configuration page that will eliminate the need to manually edit the XML source code for the dashboards

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3604,2022-01-10,07:36:46 AM,The Media Trust Add-On for Splunk,,"Nov. 21, 2017","Author: Kinney Group Inc. (appsupport@kinneygroup.com
Publication Date: May 2017
Who Is This Add-On for:
The Media Trust's malware attack data is collected from our 24/7/365 monitoring of the most popular internet sites and most active ad networks. It is verified accurate, enabling you to immediately block threats without further analysis and without disrupting user productivity. We recommend that indicators designated as Blacklist or Watchlist be immediately added to your firewall block lists.
The primary use case and major benefit of The Media Trust’s malware attack data is that it can be directly used to strengthen firewall rules and immediately block IP addresses provided in the feed, without the overhead of additional validation.  This Add-On enables access to The Media Trust’s malware attack data, and includes sample Firewall rules that you can use to immediately block traffic. In addition, you can correlate our unique threat indicators against other data sources in your core Splunk environment, and directly integrate the malware attack data into your Enterprise Security Threat Feed (if available).
Check for the latest version on SplunkBase.
This add-on was tested on the following platforms:
•   Linux: CentOS Linux release 7.0.1406, Splunk: Splunk 6.4.1 and 6.6.1
•   Windows: Windows Server 2012, Splunk: Splunk 6.6.1
System Requirements:

In addition to having Splunk installed in a working configuration, and understanding that while we believe this add-on will perform well on almost any recent version of Splunk and OS, the versions above are what we tested with, so we only know for sure it will work without obvious errors on those versions.



Install the requests module for python.


This Add-On is designed to ONLY be installed on the system where you want to use it, so that is either a Core SearchHead or an Enterprise Security SearchHead.


Installation:

Install The Media Trust Add-On for Splunk via normal methods.

Configuration:


To access the threat feed, you'll have to enter a valid license key in the add-on setup screen. To obtain a paid or trial license key from The Media Trust, please email data@themediatrust.com.


Fill out all the setup screen options and save your choices.


To get all the dashboards to work, you need the following sets of tags setup:


a.  tag=network tag=communicate
b.  tag=change tag=endpoint
Troubleshooting:

If you have an error during setup (or any normal operation), go to Troubleshooting, Threat Feed Log Review. Here is a high level overview of each log file:

a.  threat_feed.log - contains logging for setup and feed management.
b.  report_metrics.log - contains logging for the process that sends metrics to The Media Trust (if you selected that option during setup)
c.  LOG_FILE_NAME found in queries.conf (defaults to EventGen_MediaTrust.log) - log file to our custom eventgen setup

How do you know that the Threat Feed was downloaded successfully: Go to Threat-Intel Overview and see whether there is data. If you see data populated, the feed is being downloaded. If you don't see data, it’s not being downloaded. Remember that it can take you waiting out the first download interval to start to see data.  So if you have it set to 60 minutes, you’ll either have to wait out that interval or go to {$SPLUNK_HOME}/etc/apps/TA-themediatrust/local/inputs.conf and set the interval for the download_threatfeed.py script to something shorter – 600 - temporarily so the feed will be downloaded within 5 minutes.  If you change inputs.conf, don’t forget to restart Splunk.

If data is not being downloaded, check the threat_feed.log log file using instructions provided in #1. But for a pro-tip, remember that The Media Trust has to have allowed access to your specific EXTERNAL ip address that is accessing the feed.  Contact The Media Trust via email to datasupport@themediatrust.com to resolve the issue. You can use this command to test:
•   Test Command for The Media Trust whitelisting issues: curl -post301 -L ""https://www.themediatrust.com/api?key={license_key}&action=fjord_base""
•   Be sure to replace {license_key} with the actual license key provided by The Media Trust.
a.  success is a threat feed download in the file st301 in the same directory where you run the command.
b.  failure is an empty st301 file in the same directory where you run the command

If you aren't seeing anything on the bottom four panels Threat Artifacts + Activity and want to know if that's expected, open search and run the following searches:

a.  tag=network tag=communicate: make sure all of the networking sources are reporting in appropriate against those tags. If you are missing sources or events, fix your tags. Those tags feed the second row of dashboards.
b.  tag=change tag=endpoint: Make sure all of the endpoint changes are reporting in appropriately on that tag. Those should include changes made to Firewall rules and proxy blocklists based on the threat feed. Please remember the following: The Media Trust's malware attack data is collected from our 24/7/365 monitoring of the most popular internet sites and most active ad networks. It is verified accurate, enabling you to immediately block threats without further analysis and without disrupting user productivity. We recommend that indicators designated as Blacklist or Watchlist be immediately added to your firewall block lists.
Running the Add-On:
After successful setup of the add-on, the add-on runs the following scripts at intervals to perform the described functions:
a.  download_threatfeed.py - checks to see that the license file is valid; updates the message of the day; download the threat feed and places it in the appropriate locations so it can be consumed by DSS-ThreatIntelligence and The Media Trust Add-On dashboards.
b.  report_metrics.py - reports the following metrics to The Media Trust (only for those who have enabled this option and in which case we thank you as it helps us understand how our data is working in your specific environment.)
o   Counts of Threat Activity that matches The Media Trust malware attack data over the last 30 days - as rolled up by Summary Index.
o   Counts of Endpoint Changes made in response to The Media Trust malware attack data over the last 30 days - as rolled up by Summary Index.
You'll also see Mediatrust_python_handler.py in the bin directory. This is used during setup to setup all the configuration files correctly based on setup entries.",Version 1.9,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/3e021a52-cf04-11e7-9adb-02f13bdc2585.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,304,0,splunk,5,3,Kinney Group App Support,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/KGIAppSupport,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

After the add-on has been installed into Splunk and restarted, configure a data input through either of the following

from ""F1 2020 Add-on for Splunk"" app then ""Inputs"" tab
from Splunk main menu ""Settings"" then ""Data inputs""

Set the following values for the data input

Name of data input
UDP Port Number which by default is 20777 (same default as F1 2020 game)
Interval to a number (number is ignored by add-on)
Index for location of F1 data within Splunk

Note the IP address of the machine where the add-on is located. The IP address needs to be reached from the machine where the F1 2020 game is run from. The IP address of the machine may have a different internal IP address compared to the IP address that the machine can be reached on externally.
While a data input can receive data from multiple gaming rigs at the same time, there will be a point when the UDP packets will over whelm the single UDP port configured by the add-on. For multiple gaming rig set ups the preference should be for multiple data inputs with associated unique UDP port numbers.
F1 2020 Game Setup
To send telemetry from the F1 2020 game to the add-on goto ""Game Options"" then ""Settings"" then ""Telemetry Settings"", then set

UDP Telemetry to On
Broadcast Mode to Off
UDP IP Address to the IP address where the add-on is located
Port to same number used in add-on for ""UDP Port Number"" (default value is 20777)
UDP Send Rate to 10Hz
UDP Format to 2020 which is the default value

Message Description
The F1 2020 JSON messages created within Splunk are based on f1-2020-telemetry packets.py version 0.1.0 which in turn is based on Codemasters F1 2020 UDP Specification
JSON messages are created in the ""F1 2020"" format.
Troubleshooting
From within Splunk the status of the add-on can be examined if access to the _internal index is available using the following SPL -
index=_internal ""[f1_2020_addon]""
Also if the add-on is working but not receiving data, please check that UDP data can be sent to the machine and port created within ""Data inputs"". For example running the following bash command line from the same machine where the add-on is installed will send a badly formed UDP message to the add-on -
echo -n ""test"">/dev/udp/localhost/20777
The badly formed UDP message can be found within Splunk using the following SPL -
index=_internal ""[f1_2020_addon]""
Within the returned results an event similar to below should be seen if the badly formed UDP message arrived successfully in Splunk -
Error unpacking UDP packet - Bad telemetry packet: too short (4 bytes)
The bash command line can be used to send a badly formed UDP message to remote machines and different ports, for example to send to remote machine example.com on port 20778 use -
echo -n ""test"">/dev/udp/example.com/20778
Viewing F1 2020 data
The F1 2020 App for Splunk is a minimal app that contains lookup tables and pre-canned dashboards to optionally view data generated from this add-on.

About PAVO DNS App for Splunk
Overview
Most sourcetypes contain DNS events of some sort. This app provides Splunk dashboards, forms, and reports which can be used to explore your DNS events across your different sourcetypes.
To do this, the app relies on the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) for network resolution (DNS) events. This means that the app can report on any network resolution(DNS) data, as long as it has been on-boarded properly, and is available through the Network Resolution (DNS) data model.
A note on Splunk Data Model Acceleration and Disk Space
This app requires data model acceleration, which will use additional disk space. If you are using the Splunk App for Enterprise Security, this is already enabled, and should have been factored into your retention policies. If not, you should review the documentation on data model acceleration, how it uses disk space, and how to plan for it.
A note on the Splunk Common Information Model
As mentioned above, the app uses the CIM for network resolution (DNS) events. The CIM allows you to take events from a number of sources or products, and report on them in one cohesive manner, using a common set of names for fields and event types.
Available Dashboards
DNS Overview
Provides a starting point for exploring your DNS events. Most panels will drill-down to other pages in the application.
Source Profile
DNS events which appear to come from a single source.
Destination Profile
DNS events sent to a specific destination.
Query Profile
DNS query information for specific queries.
Sourcetypes (Advanced)
Information about the sourcetypes which are present in the accelerated data.
Data Transparency Overview (Advanced)
This dashboard provides field information from the data models used to retrieve data for this application. Included information includes indexes and sourcetypes found in the data model. This dashboard also shows fields and constraints in the data models.

Prerequisites
Because this App runs on Splunk Enterprise, all of the Splunk Enterprise system requirements apply.
This app depends on data models included in the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on, specifically the Network_Resolution data model. Please review the information on installing and using the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on and information on configuring the acceleration on the data model.
The Splunk Common Information Model Add-on can be downloaded from Splunkbase.
This app has been tested with versions 4.15 of the CIM add-on.
In order to make the app respond and load quickly, accelerated data models are used to provide summary data. For this data to be available, the Network_Resolution data model must be accelerated. Information on how to enable acceleration for the Network_Resolution data model can be found here. The data model must be accelerated for the length of time for which you would like to see reporting.
The Breakdown of Sourcetypes in Indexes in Dataset panel on the Data Transparency Overview dashboard will only be seen if the Sankey Diagram visualization is installed.
The Sankey Diagram Visualization can be downloaded from Sankey Diagram Custom Visualization.
Lookups
PAVO DNS App for Splunk does not contain any lookup files.

Overview
This is a Splunk modular input add-on for pulling Apica 'Web Performance' checks into Splunk for ease of indexing and analysis.
It creates a new, configurable, data input type for Splunk.
Using this input you can
 Quickly and easily configure Splunk inputs associated with Apica checks. This permits ease of use within Splunk when creating reports/searching etc.
 Tailor inputs to your specific needs e.g. set differing polling frequencies for groups of checks, configure per check access credentials for your pulls (useful if you have multi-tennant checks available in Apica)
* Set granular polling frequencies for individual checks so that you don't saturate you API endpoint
Setup


Install from the app manager page in Splunk using the provided spl. Settings / Data Inputs / Apica


If you want to install directly from soure see the instructions outlined here:   http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/AdvancedDev/ModInputsIntro


After installing create a sourcetype specification in props.conf (on the indexer/search heads)) with the following stanza.
[apica]
KV_MODE=json


Note: if you don't want to avail of Splunks structured data capabilities when searching then you can skip this step. It doesn't impact the operation of the TA in terms of sourcing data from Apica.


Input Configuration
The following notable configuration options are provided for the custom input type:


Apica Web Performance Monitor (WPM) check input name


WPM check endpoint URL


Check HTTP Operation/Method


Authentication Type  and Credentials


HTTP Proxy support


Timeout configurations


The full configuration view is rendered as follows: 
For comprehensive information see the inline help on the input creation page.
After creating your input it will be listed under the Apica type in the splunk input summary page. 
Troubleshooting/Error Logging
All log entries are written to the splunkd.log; typically ($SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log)
In addition you should check that:


Roundtrip NW access is available to the Apica API endpoint e.g. http://api-wpm.apicasystem.com/v3/


You are using valid Apica API credentials


You have correct parameters in the Apica check call you have configured e.g. a valid check number etc",Version 0.0.2,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/image/default_icon.png,"Business Analytics, Utilities",http://www.opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0,226,0,splunk,0,0,Thomas Collins,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/tcollinsrms,"Products: Splunk Enterprise

Usage

Create shapes in the shape editor and name them. This name will be used for the feature ID.
Click Save and enter a lookup name. The lookup should contain no spaces (E.g. my_shapes)
Optionally: Set permissions for the lookup so they can be used by other apps. Go to Manage Lookups, set the permission for your lookup (note it will start with geo_) and set visibility to All apps.
Use the lookup. Again, the name starts with geo_ (E.g. geo_my_shapes)

sourcetype=earthquakes 
| lookup geo_my_shapes latitude longitude OUTPUT featureId 
| stats max(mag) by featureId 
| geom geo_my_shapes featureIdField=featureId
Known Limitations

Lookups are private by default. Follow step 3 above to enable lookups throughout the app
The convention for geospatial lookup is to use geo_ as prefix. When saving a lookup through the UI, geo_ is automatically prepended to the lookup name
The app supports drawing rectangles and circles. When you save the lookup, these shapes are converted to polygons. This means, when you re-load the lookup, you won't be able to change the circle radius anymore.",Version 1.0.5,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/e437ccd2-e26a-11e6-9298-02f13bdc2585.png,"Utilities, IoT & Industrial Data",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,"1,252",0,splunk,5,7,Michael Porath,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/mporath_splunk,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

Initial Version

Prerequisites
Before installing this TA, you must have the following information from your Armis instance:

Armis Hostname
API Secret Key
Configure SIEM Integration in Armis Console. For the host, use the Splunk server that will be ingesting the data (Heavy Forwarder or Input Data Manager). You can pick any open port on that machine and will configure that port on the Splunk server in the installation steps.

Deployment Considerations
This app should be installed on the Heavy Forwarder or Input Data Manager as well as all of the indexers and search heads.
RECOMMENDED SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

Because this App runs on Splunk Enterprise, all of the Splunk Enterprise system requirements apply.

UPGRADATION OF APP

Follow the below steps to upgrade the App.
Go to Apps > Manage Apps and click on the ""Install app from file"". * Click on ""Choose File"" and select the TA-Armis installation file. * Check the Upgrade app checkbox and click on Upload. * Restart the Splunk instance.
Before upgrade disable all the enabled inputs from the UI Inputs Page.
Once the upgrade is successful, user can re-enable the inputs from the UI Inputs Page.

OR

Directly from the Find More Apps section provided in Splunk Home Dashboard.

TOPOLOGY AND SETTING UP SPLUNK ENVIRONMENT


This Add-On can be set up in two ways:
1) Standalone Mode: Install the Add-on app on a single machine. This single machine would serve as a Search Head + Indexer + Heavy Forwarder for this setup.
2) Distributed Environment: Install Add-on on Search Head and Heavy Forwarder (for REST API).

Add-on resides on Search Head machine need not require any configuration here.
Add-on needs to be installed and configured on the Heavy Forwarder system.
Execute the following command on Heavy Forwarder to forward the collected data to the indexer. /opt/splunk/bin/splunk add forward-server <indexer_ip_address>:9997
On the Indexer machine, enable event listening on port 9997 (recommended by Splunk).
Add-on needs to be installed on Search Head for CIM mapping.

Results are sent to Splunk for analysis and review. The easy-to-use editor allows anyone to create tests in minutes, without scripting and with little to no training.
Unlike Selenium-based monitoring tools, 2 Steps uses visual recognition to identify user interface elements, functioning much as a human user does. This approach means that 2 Steps is capable of automating and monitoring almost any application that has a graphical interface, including web, mobile, Windows, Citrix, Java and more, without the use of cumbersome, hard to read and costly to maintain scripts. 
What's more, 2 Steps is completely native to Splunk; you can create, schedule and monitor tests all without leaving the Splunk interface.",Version 6.0.20,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/730c0026-0602-11ec-b886-868d5b1841cb.png,"IT Operations, DevOps",https://www.2steps.io/contact,436,0,splunk,5,1,2Steps Development,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/2steps,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

-    Wireshark must be installed, and root privileges are needed on the server where sFlow samples are to be received.
Configuration:
-   One or more inputs must be configured as follows:
o   Name: this is just the input’s name
o   Interval: must be set to 0 for continuous capture of sFlow samples
o   Index: this is the Splunk index for decoded samples
o   Status: enable/disable to switch capture on/off
o   Interface: this is the name of the interface (NIC card) where sFlow samples will be received. Its IP address must match the receiver IP address configured on the sFlow switch. Execute “tshark -D” with root privileges to get a list of interfaces on which packets can be captured.
Usage guidelines:
sFlow is a sampling-based technology and can generate a huge amount of data even on a lightly utilized network. It is strongly recommended that:
-   You use this tool in a test, non-production environment
-   You only enable sFlow sampling on those switch ports where you want to analyze traffic
-   You configure a high sampling rate (e.g. 8192) 
-   You monitor your indexing stats
sFlow Analyzer for Splunk events contain decoded samples, not raw samples. Indexing requirements will be much higher than the amount of sampled (raw) data. 
In short: please consider the impact over your license usage and indexing!
sFlow samples are limited to the first 128 bytes, not the entire frame. In many situations however, 128 bytes can reveal a lot, even when using VXLAN overlays.
For example, let’s consider a VXLAN-tunneled TCP segment and let’s also assume that Q-in-Q (double tagging) is used in the underlay:
-   C-VLAN tag: 4 bytes
-   S-VLAN tag: 4 bytes
-   Underlay ethernet header: 18 bytes
-   Underlay IP header: 20 bytes
-   Underlay UDP header: 8 bytes
-   VXLAN header: 8 bytes
-   Overlay ethernet header: 18 bytes
-   Overlay IP header: 20 bytes
-   Overlay TCP header: 20 bytes (excluding options)
In this example, 120 bytes is enough to decode TCP source/destination ports in the overlay and perform a port lookup to find the application.
sFlow Analyzer modifies Wireshark’s JSON-formatted decodes to simplify Splunk searches in the following ways:
-   Differentiates between C-VLAN and S-VLAN headers
-   Creates a separate VXLAN branch grouping all overlay headers
Please note that, at this time, no special treatment is given to other tunneling technologies such as GRE, NVGRE, OTV, 6in4, IPinIP etc. Such tunneled traffic may not generate properly formatted JSON events.",Version 1.0.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/4ee3bbba-a72d-11ea-8203-0a9c9ef27d38.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html,205,0,splunk,5,1,Patricio Martelo,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/pmartelo,"Products: Splunk Enterprise

Background
When you add data to Splunk, the Splunk indexer processes it and stores it in a designated index (either, by default, in the main index or in the one that you identify). Searching in Splunk involves using the indexed data for the purpose of creating metrics, dashboards and alerts. This Splunk add-on triggers an action based on the alert in Splunk. You can use Alert actions to define third-party integrations (like Azure Sentinel Log Analytics). 
This add-on uses the Azure Log Analytics Data Collector API to send log data to Azure Sentinel. All data in the Log Analytics workspace is stored as a record with a particular record type. You can format your data to send to the HTTP Data Collector API as multiple records in JSON. When you submit the data, an individual record is created in the repository for each record in the request payload.
Pre-requisites

Onboard Splunk instance(latest release)
Get the Log Analytics workspace parameters: Workspace ID and Primary Key from here

Install the Azure Sentinel Add-on for Splunk 

In Splunk home screen, on the left side sidebar, click ""+ Find More Apps"" in the apps list, or click the gear icon next to Apps then select Browse more apps.



Search for Azure Sentinel in the text box, find the Azure Sentinel Add-On for Splunk and click Install.  
After the add-on is installed reboot of Splunk is required, click Restart Now.



Configure the Azure Sentinel add-on for Splunk
Refer to Define RealTime Alerts documentation to set up Splunk alerts to send logs to Azure Sentinel. To validate the integration, the audit index is used as an example, for an “_audit”- this repository stores events from the file system change monitor, auditing, and all user search history. You can query the data by using index=”_audit” in the search field as illustrated below.

Then use a scheduled or real-time alert to monitor events or event patterns as they happen. You can create real-time alerts with per-result triggering or rolling time window triggering. Real-time alerts can be costly in terms of computing resources, so consider using a scheduled alert, when possible.
Set up alert actions, which can help you respond to triggered alerts. You can enable one or more alert actions. Select “Send to Azure Sentinel” action, which appears after you install the Azure-Sentinel add-on as shown in the diagram below.

Fill in the required parameters as shown in the diagram below:

Customer_id: Azure Sentinel Log Analytics Workspace ID 
Shared_key: Azure Sentinel Log Analytics Primary Key
Log_Type: Azure Sentinel custom log name

Note: These parameters are required and will be used by the application to send data to Azure Sentinel through the HTTP Data Collector API.

View Splunk Data in Azure Sentinel
The logs will go to a custom Azure Sentinel table called ‘Splunk_Audit_Events_CL’ as shown below. The table name aligns with the log name provided in the Figure 4 above. It can take few minutes for events to be available.

You can query the data in Azure Sentinel using Kusto Query Language (KQL) as shown below.
Splunk_Audit_Events_CL 
 | summarize count() by user_s, action_s
 | render barchart 
When a correlation search included in the Splunk Enterprise Security or added by a user, identifies an event or pattern of events, it creates an incident called notable event. Correlation searches filter the IT security data and correlate across events to identify a particular type of incident (or pattern of events) and then create notable events.
Correlation searches run at regular intervals (for example, every hour) or continuously in real-time and search events for a particular pattern or type of activity. The notable event is stored in a dedicated notable index. You can import all notable events into Azure Sentinel using the same procedure described above.

The results will be added to a custom Azure Sentinel table called ‘Splunk_Notable_Events_CL’ as shown below.",Version 1.0.3,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/5690c37e-1eda-11eb-afaa-0281150c11dc.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,"9,691",0,splunk,0,0,Microsoft Corporation,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/microsoft_security,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

This Iguana Web Analytics Support Add-on for Machine Learning is designed to help users gain insights on predictive analytics, clustering, forecasting, and anomaly detection with respect to Web Analytics data.
This SA is a support application for its base, Iguana Web Analytics App for Splunk. Hence this application should be deployed along with the base application.
Installation
The installation of Iguana Web Analytics Support Add-on for Machine Learning follows the standard Splunk app installation procedure. There are no additional post-configuration steps required to have this SA be functional.
Limitations
This SA should be deployed on single-instance installation of Splunk. This instance should also have the base application, Iguana Web Analytics App for Splunk, deployed.
NOTE: Currently, single-instance installation of Splunk is the only supported method. Support for distributed environment will be made available in a future release of the application.
Usage
Once this SA is deployed, navigate to the now visible ""Machine Learning"" menu item within Iguana Web Analytics App for Splunk. In this menu, you will find four (4) sections:

Clustering
Prediction

Within the app there is a pipeline on top of our Machine Learning Toolkit that allows users to follow some simple click-and-select steps to load their e-learning data and select some important features in the data. The app then decides how it should be processed by an ML algorithm – including automatically deciding how the data should be pre-processed in preparation for an algorithm.
Ultimately the app provides non-expert users with a recommended model to apply to their particular data to predict: how likely a student was to pass or fail; and how likely a student was to drop off the course.
There are also a set of dashboards that can provide some easy to understand reports using the predictive models.

This  document is intended to provide installation and deployment information for the app and background omits components.
For additional support with the NetApp SANtricity Performance App for Splunk Enterprise, please visit: http://community.netapp.com/t5/E-Series-SANtricity-and-Related-Plug-ins-Discussions/bd-p/e-series-santricity-and-related-plug-ins-discussions.
Preparing to Install
Prerequisites and Requirements


Splunk 6.1 or higher installed On a Linux server.


NetApp E-Series/EF-Series Storage Arrays (any E-Series or EF-Series model running controller firmware 7.84 or higher).
Note: It may be necessary to enable the ""Legacy Management Interface"" on newer E-Series controllers in order for them to provide data to the NetApp SANtricity Performance App.


Storage capacity for configuration and performance data to accommodate one year of data collection. Additional Splunk license may be required. 


For smaller storage arrays up to 24 drives, estimate 100MB per day per storage array.


For larger storage arrays of 300 drives or more, estimate 500MB per day per storage array.




NetApp SANtricity Web Services Proxy v1.3 or greater.


Download the latest version from from https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/software/?product=E-Series+SANtricity+Web+Services+%28REST+API%29&platform=WebServices. 


Provides REST API to the storage systems and is available for both Windows and Linux systems.


NetApp SANtricity Web Services Proxy v2.0 or greater is required to create a hierarchical folder structure of arrays. This can be done through the REST API.




Technology Add-on for NetApp SANtricity - The data collection app, which also requires python.


NetApp SANtricity Performance App - The data visualization app.


Installing in a Single-Instance Splunk Environment
These instructions describe installation of all the components of the solution on a single server where Splunk version 6.1 or higher is installed.  Because this node requires a Python interpreter to drive the REST collection mechanism, it is simpler if this is a full instance of Splunk (splunk package, not splunk forwarder).
Note: These instructions assume all the components described here are installed in a single directory; that is Splunk Enterprise, Web Services Proxy, and the app components.
Note: The data collection app will ingest a variable amount of data, depending upon the number and size of the monitored arrays. The volume of data may exceed the bounds of the trial license provided with the base package (500MB / day). Therefore, it may be required to purchase a separate Splunk license to account for the data of the monitored arrays.
1 INSTALLATION OF NETAPP SANTRICITY WEB SERVICES PROXY 
    * Download an appropriate version of NetApp SANtricity Web Services Proxy from NetApp Support.
    * Install NetApp SANtricity Web Services Proxy according to the included installation instructions appropriate for your environment.

1 A large environment in this context has more than 50 storage arrays to be monitored. For information about distributed deployment for Splunk, please visit Splunk's documentation: 
http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/6.4.0/Deploy/Distributedoverview
  2 Splunk version 6.4 or higher must be installed on the data collection node.    Because this node requires a Python interpreter to drive the REST collection mechanism, it is simpler if this is a full instance of Splunk (splunk package, not splunkforwarder).
    Note: The data collection app will ingest a variable amount of data, depending upon the number and size of the monitored arrays. The volume of data may exceed the bounds of the trial license provided with the base package (500 MB per day per storage array). Therefore, it may be required to purchase a separate Splunk license to account for the data of the monitored arrays.
  3 Configure the outputs.conf configuration to specify where the collector should send its data. This destination may in fact include several distinct indexers, across which the data will be spread. Consult the administrator of the Splunk deployment to figure out the appropriate settings
  4 For rest of the installation, steps 1-4 in the previous section can be followed
Upgrading Add-on from 1.0.0 to 2.0.0

User is expected to run script upgrade_from_1.0.0_to_2.0.0.py after the app is upgraded because the changes done in the app requires this one time manual operation. User must be in bin folder of the Add-on. Command to navigate to bin folder is ""cd $SPLUNK_HOME$/etc/apps/TA-netapp_eseries/bin"". Then execute the script with following command ""$SPLUNK_HOME$/bin/splunk cmd python upgrade_from_1.0.0_to_2.0.0.py""
Later, user has to edit the accounts and set the passwords for them. Then user is expected to run the second script upgrade_helper_from_1.0.0_to_2.0.0.py with following command ""$SPLUNK_HOME$/bin/splunk cmd python upgrade_helper_from_1.0.0_to_2.0.0.py"", this will enable all those inputs for which ""Proxy Instance"" password had been set.
Final step is to restart your splunk instance.

Upgrading Add-on from 2.0.0 to Higher Version

Due to cloud vetting check, verify ssl checkbox removed from the account configuration UI. 
By default, Addon will verify ssl on each http connection while account configuration and data collection. To disable ssl verification, refer To Disable SSL Verification.
Data Collection will not be affected for already configured accounts. 

To disable SSL Certificate Verification

By default, Addon will verify ssl certificate for rest communication driven through configuration available in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-netapp_eseries/default/ta_netapp_eseries_account.conf.
User can override default configuration by adding verify_ssl = 0 parameter to the default stanza in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-netapp_eseries/local/ta_netapp_eseries_account.conf.
default stanza will hold the global parameter for each account. User also has provision to provide account specific ssl verify check by adding parameter under a account specific stanza in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-netapp_eseries/local/ta_netapp_eseries_account.conf.
Restart Splunk after changing configuration.

This data feed is the result of calls to the LANGuardian API. If you aren't receiving events check the modular input configuration to verify the event types specified


Lookups
LANGuardian App For Splunk contains no lookup files.
Event Generator
LANGuardian App For Splunk has the ability to use of an event generator. This allows the product to display data, when there are no inputs configured.
There are five sample event files supplied for event generation. These samples are found in the samples folder of the app and are:

report_1000.sample
report_1001.sample
report_1004.sample
report_1009.sample
report_1044.sample

NOTE: To generate events the Eventgen app must be installed. The app and instructions can be found at https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1924/. This app should not be installed on a production system unless you understand the ramifications of generated data being mixed with production data. It is important to realize that unless the eventgen.conf file is modified data will be put in the main index.
Configure LANGuardian App For Splunk

Install the App according to your environment (see steps above)
Navigate to ""App > LANGuardian App For Splunk > Administration > Application Configuration""

Application Configuration Dashboard
To configure the LANGuardian application you should start on the Application Configuration page (""Administration > Application Configuration"")*[]:
Application Configuration
On this screen you can set a flag that specifies that the application is configured. In the future there will be additional configurations available.
Proxy Configuration
If you have configured a proxy server you can view the configuration under this tab. These are proxy server configurations that are being used by existing modular inputs for the LANGuardian application. You can also delete existing proxy configurations on this tab.
Encrypted Credentials
You can view/delete existing credentials on this tab. These are credentials that are being used by existing modular inputs in the LANGuardian application. These credentials are the credentials used to connect to LANGuardian appliances.
Modular Inputs
On this screen you can view and make any changes to existing modular inputs. Once you are done you will need to press ""Save"" to apply your changes.
Creating New Proxy Configurations
If you need to use a proxy as part of the connection to the LANGuardian appliance configure it here.

To create a new proxy server configuration, click the Create New Proxy Configuration button and fill in the following fields:
Proxy Name: Name for the proxy configuration. This name will be used as the proxy name in the modular input configuration.
Host: Proxy host name or IP.
Port: Port used to connect to the proxy server.
Username: Username used to connect to the proxy server.
Password: Password for the username specified above.
Use SSL: Should SSL be used for the proxy configuration?



Creating New Credentials
By default creating a new modular input with a username and password specified will create the necessary encrypted credentials. However if you want to create encrypted credentials manually follow this process:

To create a new encrypted credential, click the Create New Credential button and fill in with the appropriate username and password.
The realm is the application name where the encrypted credential is created + the username.

NOTE: By default creating a new modular input will automatically create a new encrypted credential so this process is not necessary unless you need a new credential for another purpose.
Creating New Modular Inputs
NOTE: You will need to configure a new modular input for each appliance

To create a new data input, click the Create New Modular Input button and fill in the following fields. Those with a red asterisk on the screen are required.
Modular Input Name: Name for the data input configuration.
Hostname: The hostname or IP address of the LANGuardian appliance to receive data from.
Username: The username used to connect to the appliance.
Password: The password for the previously specified username.
Interval: The number of seconds indicate how often the input will poll for new data. This setting must be at least 60.
Toggle all reports: Check to select all reports.
Report IDs: List of reports available on the LANGuardian appliance. Check the report if you wish to pull event data.
Custom Report IDs: Enter report IDs (comma-separated list) for reports that are not listed above but may have been user created.
Use Proxy: Indicates if a proxy should be use for communication with the LANGuardian appliance.
Proxy Name: Enter the name of the proxy stanza to use with the input.
Custom Report IDs: A comma seperated list of custom report IDs to be consumed by the data input.
Set Sourcetype: Sets the sourcetype for events collected by this data input. Changing this option from automatic may have negative effects on this app as a whole.
Host: Sets the hostname to assign to data being collected by this input. It overwrites what is indicated by the data being collected.

Index: This sets the index for data to be written to. This setting should be changed from default, which normally writes to the main index, to a specified index for best performance.


After creating the modular input you will need to disable/re-enable the input in ""Settings > Data Inputs > LANGuardian App For Splunk"" to activate the input.


NOTE: When configuring the modular input through the Application Configuration dashboard, the password is automatically encrypted into the credential store. If you need to change the credential, create a new credential, and reference the host/user pair in the modular input configuration. An encrypted credential is required for this Splunk App.

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4763,2022-01-10,07:38:23 AM,App for McAfee FireCore (McAfee Client Proxy MCP UCE),https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/screenshots/5e5b64e8-f8e2-11e9-9d4e-0658c56bb950.png,"Aug. 7, 2021","ABOUT
This App helps to setup and maintain McAfee Client Proxy (MCP) deployment.
During the MCP setup it is not enough just to install/deploy the MCP executable and configure proxy settings. Sooner or later some exceptions need to be configured. Usually (bad practice) exceptions are configured only after a user complains that something doesn't work. A better plan of action is to be proactive and to configure exceptions in advance.
This app allows you to collect FireCore logs from one or many systems and shows which connections are being redirected to which proxies and which connections bypass proxy.
Discuss the Splunk App for McAfee FireCore on Splunk Answers at http://answers.splunk.com/answers/app/4763
This is a first public release, consider it Beta.
REQUIREMENTS
TA_McAfee_FireCore Add-On (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4762/)
INSTALLATION
For a single deployment (to collect FireCore logs from one system only) you need to install Splunk Enterprise + TA_McAfee_FireCore Add-On + McAfee_FireCore App on the system where MCP is installed.
For a distributed deploymeint (to collect FireCore logs from many systems):
  *  install Splunk Universal Forwarder + TA_McAfee_FireCore Add-On on each client system where MCP is installed
  *  install Splunk Enterprise + TA_McAfee_FireCore Add-On + McAfee_FireCore App on a separate server to collect logs
  *  configure (if not yet done) input on Splunk Enterprise
  *  configure output on each Universal Forwarder
  *  restart Universal Forwarder to enable FireCore Logging
This app tested for MCP 2.x and 3.x version on x64 Windows platform.
KNOWN ISSUES
  *mcpservice.exe process cannot be filtered out.
TODO
  *enable name resolution for ip addresses.

Introduction
The ""Log Source Status"" app is a simple Search Assistant (SA) that determines the last time data was received from a given source, and utilizes that information for time based alerts and dashboards on the health of your data inputs. It was written originally to provide visibility into the health of the servers reporting in themselves, and ensure uptime.
Installation
The application is extremely lightweight, and as such simply needs to be unpacked. Before you begin using the app, you will need to run the included ""device_state_update_population"" search. This will run a tstats over all of your historical data and catalog all log sources. If you have a lot of historical data indexed, it's heavily recommended that you let the search run overnight.

Overview
Many organizations is IDS/IPS devices and software as their first line of defense against attackers. This app provides Splunk dashboards, forms, and reports which can be used to explore your IDS events across your different sourcetypes.
To do this, the app relies on the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) for IDS attack events. This means that the app can report on any intrusion data, as long as it has been on-boarded properly, and is available through the Intrusion Detection data model, including network, host, wireless, and application products.
A note on Splunk Data Model Acceleration and Disk Space
This app requires data model acceleration, which will use additional disk space. If you are using the Splunk App for Enterprise Security, this is already enabled, and should have been factored into your retention policies. If not, you should review the documentation on data model acceleration, how it uses disk space, and how to plan for it.
A note on the Splunk Common Information Model
As mentioned above, the app uses the CIM for intrusion events. The CIM allows you to take events from a number of sources or products, and report on them in one cohesive manner, using a common set of names for fields and event types.
Available Dashboards
Intrusion Overview
Provides a starting point for exploring your IDS events. Most panels will drill-down to other pages in the application.
Attack Source Profile
A view based on the source of IDS events.
Attack Destination Profile
IDS events where attacks are launched against the same destination.
Attack Signature Profile
Panels which focus on events which all are from the same identified with the same signature.
Attack Category Profile
A view focusing on attacks which fall into the same category (as defined in the events).
Attack Search
A form for finding events based on various field values.
Sourcetypes
Information about the sourcetypes which are present in the accelerated data.

Prerequisites
Because this App runs on Splunk Enterprise, all of the Splunk Enterprise system requirements apply.
This app depends on data models included in the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on, specifically the Intrusion Detection data model. Please review the information on installing and using the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on and information on configuring the acceleration on the data model.
The Splunk Common Information Model Add-on can be downloaded from Splunkbase.
This app has been tested with versions 4.9 of the CIM add-on.
In order to make the app respond and load quickly, accelerated data models are used to provide summary data. For this data to be available, the Intrusion Detection data model must be accelerated. Information on how to enable acceleration for the Intrusion Detection data model can be found here. The data model must be accelerated for the length of time for which you would like to see reporting.
The Breakdown of Sourcetypes in Indexes in Dataset panel on the Data Transparency Overview dashboard will only be seen if the Sankey Diagram visualization is installed.
The Sankey Diagram Visualization can be downloaded from Sankey Diagram Custom Visualization.

Create a query with a single zero value to hide the TARDIS
Create a query with a single non zero value to show the TARDIS
Create a real time query that outputs single zero/non zero values to make the TARDIS materialize and dematerialize

Visualization configuration

Choose to play sound when TARDIS materializes and dematerializes
Choose to delay the TARDIS materializes sequence ( useful when 2 TARDIS dashboard panels are on screen at the same time and want to make TARDIS ""move"" from one panel to another )

Notes

When using a real time query it can take 30-45 seconds for the TARDIS to materialize/dematerialize. If the data changes more frequently than this then the TARDIS visualization may lag behind the actual data value.
On the home screen of the app it may take upto 90 seconds for the TARDIS to initially appear, this is due to the underlying real time query used, not the visualization itself.
If computer/laptop goes into sleep mode or browser window/tab is not the front screen any real time querys using the TARDIS may pause or become out of sync. If the vizualization pauses or becomes out of sync refresh the browser window/tab.
To view some of the dashboard examples correctly including ""Home"", the user must be able to run real time queries. For Splunk Cloud customers this may also require a support ticket to be raised to enable the ""rtsearch"" role capability.
Some browsers may disable automatically playing sounds from a website. Ensure automatically playing sounds is enabled for the Splunk website where the TARDIS has been installed.",Version 2.0.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/7c5a2eac-cea6-11eb-b023-0ade35b64519.png,"Business Analytics, Utilities",https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT,"1,481",0,splunk,5,5,Mark Sivill,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/msivill_splunk,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

Basically what this does vs the official TA-nmap is actually run the nmap script for you. To add items simply edit scan.sh with a list of your hosts and you'll collect open ports into Splunk.
I borrowed tags from ES/PCI and fields from CIM so should plug right in.
The script in TA-simple-nmap bin generates logs files in /var/log/nmap. Please ensure you have some sort of logrotation in place.
1) dashboards
2) data models
3) CIM
4) App works as TA and SA all in one. Surplus files Splunk will just ignore.
5) Generates a portprofile so you can compare machines quickliy as a summary

Overview
This is a Splunk Modular Alert for posting alerts to a Yammer group.
Dependencies

Splunk 6.3+
Supported on Windows, Linux, MacOS, Solaris, FreeBSD, HP-UX, AIX
Active Office 365 Yammer subscription

Setup

Download the release
$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk install yammer_alerts.spl -update 1
Restart Splunk

Office 365 Setup

Create a user for Splunk to send as the alerts
Ensure that user can post to all the groups that you want

Yammer Auth token
Okay, this is horrible, but it works.  There is an issue on GitHub to fix this.
Yammer
Because I haven't yet created a proper auth process in Splunk, you'll have to work around it.  We'll create a client application then manually go through the process of getting a code then the token.  These instructions are taken from the Yammer Dev Docs - Test Token

Create a Yammer Client Application
Set the Redirect URI to https://www.yammer.com/
Make a note of the Client ID and Client Secret
Paste this URL into your browser where the client_id is the value obtained above

https://www.yammer.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=[client_id]&redirect_uri=https://www.yammer.com/

Copy the code parameter from the URL created
Paste this URL into your browser, where client_id, client_secret are obtained in step 3 above and the code comes from step 4

https://www.yammer.com/oauth2/access_token.json?client_id=[client_id]&client_secret=[client_secret]&code=[code]

From the JSON object returned, copy the token field

Splunk GUI

Settings -> Alert Actions -> Yammer Alerts -> Setup Yammer Alerting
Paste the token from step 6 above into the text box

Splunk Config File
Edit or create the file $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/yammer_alerts/local/alert_actions.conf
[yammer]
param.token = <token from yammer.com>
Using
Perform a search in Splunk and then navigate to : Save As -> Alert -> Trigger Actions -> Add Actions -> Yammer Alerts
On this dialogue you can enter the group_id to post to and body to send.
For the body field, token substitution can be used just the same as for email alerts
Logging
Browse to: Settings -> Alert Actions -> Yammer Alerts -> View Log Events
Or you can search directly in Splunk
index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd component=sendmodalert action=""yammer""
Troubleshooting

Is your group_id correct?
Are your alerts actually firing?
Is your auth token correct?

This app utilizes index-time extractions for metadata populating and index routing. 
Environment Configuration:
- Set all UTM 9 devices to forward logs to a syslog server
- Install UF on Syslog Server
- Either manually or via Deployment Server place an input on the Syslog Server's UF 
  to grab the Sophos logs. Set the sourcetype to ""sophos:utm""
- Place the TA on the indexers and search heads for field extractions
TA Configuration:
- The Sophos TA uses TRANSFORMS to convert the sophos:utm sourcetype to firewall events, 
  http proxy events, and intrusion detection events based on these sourcetypes:
    - sophos:utm:fw
    - sophos:utm:httpproxy
    - sophos:utm:ids
- Fieldaliases are used for CIM compliance to the following Data Models:
    - Network Traffic
    - Intrusion Detection
    - Web
- Transforms grab the accurate host name as the second host name in the log. Remove this 
  if the syslog server is updated with accurate domain resolution
- Transforms can place the events in to their corresponding indexes
    - Firewall - netfw
    - Http Proxy - netproxy
    - IDS - netids
- Add the following line to local/props.conf and adjust individual transforms in local/transforms.conf to suite local index naming standards

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5209,2022-01-10,07:38:44 AM,Time Macros,,"Nov. 2, 2021","Supported Macros
As of 1.1.0, these are included:

tm_relative_time(epoch, relative) wraps the relative_time() eval function to shift an epoch time by a relative time modifier.
tm_strptime(timestr, format) wraps the strptime() eval function to convert a formatted time string to an epoch.
tm_strftime(epoch, format) wraps the strftime() eval function to convert an epoch into a formatted time string.
tm_trp2epoch(trp) converts the output of a timerangepicker into an epoch.
tm_relative_trp(trp, relative) combines tm_trp2epoch() with tm_relative_time(), it converts a timerangepicker output into epoch and then shifts that by a relative time modifier. Combining two macro calls like you would combine function calls in eval is not a thing, that's why a whole new macro is needed.
tm_business_hour_delta(start, end, output, resolution) writes the seconds that passed between start and end in resolution minute steps into the output field, but stops the clock outside business hours.
tm_business_hour_filter defines what your business hours are, predefined as ""Mon-Fri, 08:30 inclusive to 18:00 exclusive"". Override locally with an mvfilter() expression as needed for your business hours.

Known Issues

The macros use time() instead of now() for relative time calculations due to eval macro restrictions. In most scenarios relative time modifiers snapping to an hour, a day, etc. smooth over this difference. Keep it in mind if you manually override the value of now, such as when re-running old summary searches with fill_summary_index.py!
tm_business_hour_filter only works up to 10000 resolution-minute-steps, ie at the default 10-minute resolution it's good for 69 days (all hours, not just business hours). Consider 60-minute resolution if you need just over a year of working deltas, 1-minute-resolution if you need precision but don't care for deltas of a week or more. Excessively high resolution for long durations has a measurable command.eval impact if executed for many events.

Usage Examples:
Let's say your events contain an expiration_date field in epoch, and you want to find things that expired before August 1st 2020 in your user timezone:
index=foo sourcetype=bar expiration_date < `tm_strptime(""2020-08-01"", ""%F"")` | ...
This is converted to normalizedSearch/phase0 expiration_date<1596232800.000000 (see Job Inspector), and will use a lispy-based filter powered off tsidx files if expiration_date is declared as an indexed field for massive speed benefits.
If you used subsearches to do this calculation in the past, Time Macros is for you! Example by @jeffland:
Old style: index=foo some_epoch_field >= [| makeresults | eval search = relative_time(now(), ""-1h@h"")]
Time Macro style: index=foo some_epoch_field >= `tm_trp2epoch(""-1h@h"")`
Instead of launching a whole new search process to do one simple calculation, the eval-based macro will do the calculation during search expansion for virtually no added execution time.
Want to compare two time ranges in a dashboard without two timerange pickers?
Put one timerange picker time into the dashboard alongside a dropdown shift of ""sane"" comparison times such as -w, -2w, -d, -y, -mon, etc. and use tm_relative_trp(""$time.earliest$"", ""$shift$"") macro to compute the shifted earliest time for the comparison search.
Need to calculate the time it took to close a ticket, but only count time that passed during business hours? No Problem: index=tickets | `tm_business_hour_delta(start_time, end_time, output_field)` | ...",Version 1.1.1,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/2b4dc288-3c0d-11ec-9648-9a0a62e5edc2.png,Utilities,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/,219,0,splunk,5,2,Martin Müller,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/martin_mueller,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

You can learn more about the Blue Shark application family by visiting the Blue Shark FAQ.
Also check out our YouTube video demonstrating the app in action!
Before You Begin
Please make sure of the following before beginning your installation:
Make sure you have downloaded the latest Wereshark Blue Shark Basic package (.spl file) and have access to it.  
The Splunk ‘sourcetype’ for your Blue Coat ProxySG inputs will be changed as part of the configuration process. Please make sure you know how these inputs are defined and your Splunk account has the proper administrative access.
Installing an app requires a Splunk restart.  The whole configuration process should take 5 - 10 minutes (not including the restart) but make sure you are doing this when Splunk can be restarted.  
Installation
If you are a seasoned Splunk user and have experience managing both apps and inputs, here’s what you need to do:

Upload and install the Wereshark Blue Shark Basic app using Splunk’s ‘Install App from File’ feature.  You will need to restart Splunk.
Change the Splunk ‘sourcetype’ of your Blue Coat ProxySG inputs to blueshark_defaults.  This sourcetype can be found in the sourcetype list.
Go the the ‘Manage Apps’ screen and launch Blue Shark Basic
Accept the EULA and start exploring your data.  Note that historical data will not be presented - it has been indexed using the original sourcetype.  New logs coming from your proxies will be classified properly and displayed.

Finishing Up
Wereshark’s Blue Shark Basic app is now installed and configured.  If the dashboards are not displaying data, please check the Troubleshooting section, below.
Wereshark provides support using its forums - the Shark Frenzy - and the support ticketing system - the Shark Shiver.  If you haven’t done so already, establish user accounts on both of these systems.  A Wereshark administrator checks new user accounts and verifies whether or not the user is paid customer.  If so, the administrator sets the proper access levels.  The links below will take you to the user account pages.

Shark Shiver - support ticket system
Product Documentation

Thanks again for purchasing Wereshark Blue Shark Basic.  
Troubleshooting
If you are not seeing any dashboards light up, or the the Blue Shark Search feature returns no results, please check the following:

Make sure you have current logs from your proxies - that is, logs sent in after you set the sourcetype on the appropriate inputs.  There are several ways to configure the ProxySG to transmit the log files, so you may be waiting for a batch transmission time.
Blue Shark Basic supports the bcreportermain_v1 log format.  Please check the Proxy_SG configuration to ensure the logs are being generated using this format.",Version 1.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/08f989cc-1587-11e6-845c-06caea5ac9f9.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",http://wereshark.io/wereshark-inc-eula/,296,0,splunk,5,1,Wereshark Inc.,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/wereshark,"Products: Splunk Enterprise

The NSA Whitepaper can be obtained here: https://www.iad.gov/iad/library/reports/spotting-the-adversary-with-windows-event-log-monitoring.cfm
NOTE: These Windows dashboards were designed with the intent of never modifying windows event log data contained within your database. This is why some dashboards use extensive regex to parse events at search time.
== SysMon ==
This section of the application provides easy to use dashboards for visualising SysInternals SysMon logs.
SysInternals SysMon must be installed and configured on endpoints. Some dashboards require that image / driver / process access etc is configured. 'Posh-Sysmon' is a fantastic powershell framework designed to assist with the creation of SysMon XML configurations.
== Troubleshooting ==
No data displayed?
1) Please ensure the user account you are searching with has accessed to the desired indexes and these indexes are searchable by default for the user.
2) For Windows & SysMon logs, please ensure the data is being written to the index called 'wineventlog'. If the logs are being written to a different index, please remove the reference to 'index=wineventlog' in each dashboard query.
3) If you are sending data from Airlock, please ensure the sourcetype is set with a name of 'airlock'.
Failed to Load Source for Parallel-Coordinates Visualization
1) Please clear your browser cache which should resolve the issue after the Parallel-Coordinates upgrade;
2) Alternitavely test the plugin by loading the relevant dashboard in your browsers 'incognito' mode.",Version 2.4.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/011f9bce-e9f3-11eb-9d18-02860ecfd319.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,"1,246",0,splunk,4,3,David Cottingham,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/davidcottingham,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

About Google Workspace For Splunk
Google Workspace For Splunk allows a Splunk Enterprise administrator to interface with Google Workspace, consuming the usage and administrative logs provided by Google. The limitations on collection times are specified: https://support.google.com/a/answer/7061566 .
Version 1.5.3




Bug




[GSUITE-41] - Internal GW Log parsing


Updated internal Google Workspaces log parsing to better have actual sourcetypes.


index=_internal sourcetype=google:workspaces*








[GSUITE-42] - Enable Bulk Edit for inputs

Updated the Configuration UI to allow for bulk editing. Look for the pencil and checkmarks at the top-right of the tables.







[GSUITE-43] - Checkpointing Broken

Checkpointing was using the wrong function and was pulling data from the initial write of the first data pull. This has been fixed.











Improvement


Upgraded various Python packages in $APP_HOME/lib/


Fixed the About Dashboard.






Known Issues
Version 1.5.3 of Google Workspace For Splunk has the following known issues:


According to stackoverflow, there are indications that the Google Apps Admin API has an unspecified delay introduced into the events that are collected. This is most likely due to how Google collects the events and the global nature of the events. To mitigate this issue, the Google Workspace For Splunk Modular Input has a built-in delay in the consumption of events. If you run the modular input at 30 minutes, there will be a 30 minute delay of events. If you run at 1 hour, there will be a 1 hour delay in events.

Navigate to the Google Workspace Credentials tab.


Download/have on hand the JSON file from the Developers Console for the Service Account Credentials.


Click the + sign at the top right of the table.


Fill out the form, upload the JSON file, and click the checkmark to the left of the row.


The Entire contents of the JSON file will be stored in the encrypted credential store.


Configure the Admin Reports Inputs
Requires: Audit API Each API endpoint has individual APIs that need to be enabled within https://console.developers.google.com.




For each Report that would like to be consumed, configure a new row for that report. One report per credential per row.


Lookback - this setting will consume that many days back from the API. This is a first-run-to-completion flag only.




Interval - Each report has a slightly different recommended interval.

Please review https://support.google.com/a/answer/7061566 and schedule the input service interval accordingly.









Configure the Admin Usage Inputs
Requires: Admin SDK API Each API endpoint has individual APIs that need to be enabled within https://console.developers.google.com.




For each Report that would like to be consumed, configure a new row for that report. One report per credential per row.


Lookback - this setting will consume that many days back from the API. This is a first-run-to-completion flag only.




Interval - Each report has a slightly different recommended interval.

Please review https://support.google.com/a/answer/7061566 and schedule the input service interval accordingly.











Usage - User, Customer

These are done at a seconds interval of 86400





Configure the Alert Center Inputs
Requires: Google Workspace Alert Center API #. For each alert center, configure a row in the table to pull the information desired.
 1.  View more information at https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/alertcenter/reference/alert-types .
Configure Classroom Inputs
Requires: Google Classroom API


NOTE: Checking the Write Courses Data checkbox for ANY input will cause the input to write out ALL course metadata each pull. To keep the data down to a reasonable level, only configure 1 input to consume that data.


CourseIDs are a comma separated list of specific course ids. If empty, all will be consumed.


Most, if not all, of these could be fine at a 86400 interval.


Configure Big Query Inputs
Requires: BigQuery API


For GMail Headers: Documentation From Google


Fill out the fields for the project, dataset, table. If all tables are required from a single dataset, enter an asterisk. *




The Ingest Type is one of Row, Query, Time.


Row: is a full pull of the rows from the table. Be careful using on dynamic tables, if any rows are deleted, this will not work as expected.


Query: Place your SQL query in the Enrichment Field column. You can support checkpointing by using ##TIMESTAMP## in the Query String. The timestamp is a 10 digit integer and is based on the last execution time of the input. THIS MAY INCUR COSTS.


Time: This is a very simple query. Uses a checkpoint time, and the Time field that is in the Enrichment Field (iso_time for example). It will consume all fields and columns from the data. THIS MAY INCUR COSTS.


Virtual Row: is a pull of all the rows of VIEW, but checkpointed per vuew. This allows for a virtual table to be pulled while respecting the row counts of the larger table. This should be used with GMail Audit Logs. Dataset and Project required, any VIEWS will be queried and checkpointed. THIS MAY INCUR COSTS.






The Starting Index is a first time only setting. Consumption will start from that row line, and will be checkpointed after first run. This can also be a timestamp for Ingest Types of Time and Query (10 digit)


Highly environmentally dependent for speed of consumption. Work with max_rows setting to determine proper messages per interval. Default is 250,000.


Note: Query, Virtual Row, and Time ingest types are EXPENSIVE. I AM NOT LIABLE FOR YOUR SPENDING.
 Queries (on-demand) $5 per TB The first 1 TB per month is free.
Configure PubSub Inputs
Requires: Cloud Pub/Sub API

Fill out the row with appropriate settings. Work with Max Messages to determine proper messages per interval setting for the environment.

NOTE: Pubsub requires the use of grpcio binaries. Only a many linux x64 file is included with this app. Please follow these instructions if you see any errors with the search: index=_internal log_level=ERROR sourcetype=""google:workspaces:modularinput:pubsub"" error_filename=""ga_pubsub.py"" | stats values(error_*) as error_* by input_guid input_name


Consult The Project Page and download the file that matches Python 3.7 and your filesystem. Download it to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/google_workspace_for_splunk/lib


Cd to that same folder, and execute unzip -n <package>.whl, or an equivalent command on the OS required.


This will install the .so file to the location required for the Scripts to work.


Configure Spreadsheet Inputs


Requires:


Google Drive API


Google Sheets API






Select the credential that you want to use.


Select the Spreadsheet dropdown. This should auto-populate with the spreadsheets that are allowed for the impersonation user configured on the credential.


Select the Sheets (multiple allowed) to consume.




Set the destination




KVStore


Takes the sheets, and places the data into KVStore lookups.


Ordered: Keeps row and column placements for a true re-structure of the data.


UnOrdered: consumes each column as a key value into the lookup.








CSV


Takes the sheets, and places the data into CSV lookups.


Ordered: Keeps row and column placements for a true re-structure of the data.

The Splunk for OpenAM App provides security reporting and analysis tool for OpenAM log data (open source access management, entitlements and federation server platform) through dashboards on authentications, users, and applications, as well as a tracking interface to explore users' authentication events.
Prerequisites
This App has been developped on Splunk 6.4 with OpenAM v12.
- Splunk 6.2 or ulterior is a prerequisite
- Other OpenAM versions have not been qualified and fields' extractions may have to be adapted if necessary
- For all other prerequisites, please refer to instructions below
Instructions
Please refer to Readme pages for installation and configuration instructions :
- CLI : vi $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SplunkforOpenAM/README.txt
- WebUI : Click on ""Readme"" page on Navigation Menu of ""Splunk for OpenAM"" App
FAQ
Service Providers dashboard is very slow on Splunk versions prior to 6.3.
--> Please upgrade at least to Splunk 6.3 for best performances.
Splunk Navigation Menu is not displayed on Readme page on Splunk versions prior to 6.4.
--> Please upgrade at least to Splunk 6.4 to display the navigation menu on this page
Tracking dashboard returns ""Invalid latest_time: latest_time must be after earliest_time."" error when clicking on a line.
--> Please don't use ""All Time"" in DataRangePicker for this dashboard.
This App doesn't work since v1.2 upgrade
--> Since v1.2, search requests have been modified to search only by sourcetypes instead of using an ""openam"" index by default (This allow you to use your own index).
--> If a specific index is used (like ""openam""), please add this index to be searched by default in user role or modify search requests on dashboards to use this index.
Server inputs on dashboards returns all devices, even if it's not an OpenAM server.
--> Since v1.2, populating search has been modified to not search in an ""openam"" index by default
--> To return only OpenAM servers on dashboards inputs, please modify populating search requests by specifying your index (for example, replace ""| metadata index=* type=hosts"" by ""| metadata index=openam type=hosts"" if your OpenAM logs are in an index named ""openam"").

Ingest Process Creation Events with Parent Process information in Splunk

Usage
The pstree command requires two arguments, child and parent. The command is intended for sysmon EventCode=1 events but can be used for anything. The command returns a row for each root value with a multivalue field, ""tree"", containing the root value and all childern values.
Note: Fields passed as arguments to the pstree command must be referenced before calling pstree. The simplest way to ensure this is to include ""| fields *"" prior to piping to pstree. Thanks to github user spitzd for discovering.
Simple Sysmon Usage

The Slack Audit App for Splunk gives you critical insights into your Slack Enterprise Grid account.

The app includes:
 A pre-built knowledge base of dashboards that deliver real-time visibility into your environment.
 The dashboards showcase 
    - User Logins and Admin actions such as Users Added
    - Popular App Installations, Approved and Retricted App Details
    - File Activity
    - Workspace Preference Change Activity
    - Private/Public Channel Creations, User/Guest Joins and External Shared Channel Details
Setup Instructions
The Slack Audit App for Splunk needs Audit log data to be indexed into the slack_audit index. 
 Use the Technology Add-on to retrieve Slack Audit Logs : Slack Add-on for Splunk
 Be sure to set the index to retrieve these logs into, to be named slack_audit
Preferences Activity Dashboard
The Preferences Activity Dashboard has the Event Timeline panel that relies on the Event Timeline App to be installed. Download the app to see the panel show up.
Troubleshooting

Verify that the the Slack Audit Logs are being populated into the right index, i.e., slack_audit
Verify that the Splunk account has access to the index containing the audit logs.
If not, perform the below steps to change the macro definition :
Navigate to Settings -> Advanced Search -> Search Macros
Set the App Context to be Slack Audit App for Splunk, Owner to be Any and Visible in the App
Click on the macro named slack_audit_log_index
Under its definition, change the name of the index to the index where slack audit log data is currently being populated. 
Should you configure to index audit logs into multiple indexes, for example sending audit logs of different Enterprise Grid Slack Accounts/Organizations into different indexes, change the macro to reflect those indexes as well. For instance :
Production Enterprise Slack Account Audit log index : slack_audit
Dev Enterprise Slack Account Audit log index : slack_audit_dev
New macro definition : (index=slack_audit OR index=slack_audit_dev)


Click on Save to save the new configuration
Re-open the Slack Audit App for Splunk to see the dashboards displaying data.


Preferences Activity dashboard would require installation of the Event Timeline App

Installation Instructions
TA-Savvius-nix
How to install Splunk Forwarder on Omnipliance

Download the Splunk Universal Forwarder from splunk.com
copy forwarder to /opt
Install Forwarder
>cd /opt
>gunzip splunkforwarder-VERSION.tgz
>tar xvf splunkforwarder-VERSION.tar
>cd /opt/splunkforwarder/bin
>./splunk enable boot-start
>./splunk start
>./splunk add forward-server hostname.domain:9997 

How to install Savvius TA

Download the ta-savvius-nix_VER.tgz file from Splunkbase onto the Omnipliance
Copy the file to /tmp 
Install the app from the cmd line:
>./splunk install app /tmp/ta-savvius-nix_VER.tgz
>./splunk restart
>./splunk list forward-server
Ensure that Splunk server is in the active list

How to configure receiving on the Splunk Server

From the Splunk UI goto Settings->Forwarding and receiving
Select “Configure receiving”
Select New
Enter 9997 for the port
Select Save
Or from the command line: >./splunk enable listen 9997 

How to configure capture engine (9.0.3) to send data to Splunk server

service omnid stop
edit /etc/omni/omni.conf
add the following line to /etc/omni/omni.conf: ""reportspath /var/lib/omni/data/statistics""
service omnid start

How to Configure the Capture

On your Capture Engine, create a capture called “Splunk”.  
Enable Statistics Output
Select an interval 
o   10 minutes is a good default
o   The smaller the interval the longer components take to refresh in the Splunk App
Select CSV report
Enable Reset Statistics
Select Set Schedule 
Select “Every time”
Specify how many files to keep. 1 should be fine.  More allows the Splunk server to go down for longer periods of time and still catch up.

Changing the Capture name
The reason for the capture name of “Splunk” is because the inputs.conf file in the TA tells the Splunk forwarder which capture to collect CSV files for. If the capture is named something different, then change the name of the folder in the inputs.conf file to match the capture name. “…” can be used in place of the capture name to collect CSV report files from all captures.
Performance Benchmarks
In order for an Omnipliance or an OmniPeek Capture Engine to generate analysis that can be saved to CSV files and ingested into Splunk, certain Analysis Options have to be enabled. Which Analysis Options are enabled depends on what types of analysis will be useful to you. It is important to understand that the more analysis enabled, the lower the performance is going to be. Performance in this case is how much traffic can be captured. 
When creating your Splunk captures, be sure and go to the Analysis Options Tab in the Capture Options Dialog. Here is where the analysis options are configured. By default, everything will be enabled. With everything enabled, the analysis performance, or maximum data rate that can be captured and processed, although dependent on many factors like packet size, number of nodes, protocols, etc.., will be less than 1Gbps. By selectivly disabling analysis that is not important to you, performance will increase siginificantly.
Performance can also be increased by using a smart tap to load balance the traffic over multiple captures on different ports, as well as multiple Omnipliances and OmniPeek Capture Engines.
CSV Files and Splunk sourcetype
In order to generate CSV files that Splunk can index, Analysis Options have to be enabled for the Splunk capture. Each type of CSV file has a list of fields as the first row of the file. The Savvius for Splunk Dashboards uses a seperate sourcetype for each of the different types of CSV files that are imported from the Splunk Forwarder into the Splunk Server. Some of the files share the same data-model and use the same sourcetype. The name of each sourcetype is listed below along with the file of files that it is associated with:

sv_nodes - (Node Statistics-IP.csv, Node Statistics-IPv6.csv, Node Statistics-Physical.csv) List of nodes with byte and packet counts for each

sv_protocols - (Protocol Statistics-Instance.csv) List of protocols with byte and packet counts for each
sv_flows - (Expert Flow Statistics.csv) List of flows with bytes, packets, response times, and many other stats for each

Getting started
This app is not ""visible"" in the Splunk UI app menu. After installing the app, follow this process:
1. Do a search of any data and switch to the visualisation tab
2. In the top left, in the visualisastion menu, select ""Sunburst viz""
3. Open the ""Format"" menu then select ""Help""
4. There will be a link to the in-app documentation, which includes working examples

Usage
This visualisation expects tablular data, with any amount of text/category columns, but the last column should be the numerical value. Null or blank columns are allowed before the final column to create a more ""sunburst-y"" visualization.
The typical search uses stats command like so:
index=* | stats count BY index sourcetype source
Sidenote: a much faster search to do the same thing is 
|tstats count where index=* BY index sourcetype source
Note that stats does not return rows when the group BY field is null. Use this one simple trick to convert nulls to be an empty string instead:
index=_internal | eval component = coalesce(component,"""") | eval log_level = coalesce(log_level,"""") | stats count by sourcetype component log_level
Add more fields after the ""BY"" keyword to increase the depth of the sunburst

Formatting options

The ""Color overrides"" field accepts either a JSON object (in curly braces) or comma separated pairs. For example to make sure that ""INFO"" values are green, WARN's are orange and ERROR's are red, set the value like so:
INFO,#1a9035,ERROR,#b22b32,WARN,#AF5300

Background
Using the Splunk reporting connector for managed Chrome browsers, organizations can get additional visibility on the security posture of their organization's managed browser fleet. This integration between Chrome and Splunk allows IT administrators to send Chrome security events to an HTTP event collector (HEC) endpoint. Chrome administrators can select all or a subset of available Chrome audit events to send to Splunk. Examples of Chrome browser security events include malware transfer, unsafe site visits, password reuse and password change events. 
Please note that this add-on and the Splunk reporting connector feature is available in preview only for customers participating in Google's Trusted Tester program. It is currently not a generally available feature.
Affiliation
While this add-on is designed to integrate with Google Chrome audit data, it is not affiliated with or endorsed by Google. Similarly, usage of the Google Chrome logo in the Splunkbase listing and add-on interface is for informational purposes only.
Prerequisites
Use of this add-on requires:

Participation in the Google Trusted Tester program
Enrollment in Chrome Browser Cloud Management
Configuration of the Splunk ""reporting connector"" integration within the Chrome Browser Cloud Management console 
A publically available HTTP Event Collector endpoint

Setup
Chrome
Please refer to the official Google documentation for more information on setting up Chrome Browser Cloud Management and the Splunk reporting connector.
Splunk
Install
Please target search heads when installing this Add-on. For Splunk Cloud, refer to Install apps in your Splunk Cloud deployment. For customer managed deployments, refer to the standard methods for Splunk Add-on installs as documented for a Single Server Install or a Distributed Environment Install.
Sourcetype
This add-on expects Chrome events to arrive with a sourcetype of google:chrome:json. Please use a dedicated HTTP Endpoint Collector (HEC) token which explicitly sets this sourcetype on incoming events. For more information on setting up HEC tokens and customizing HEC sourcetypes, please refer to HEC setup documentation.
Details
In order to handle event-specific field aliases, each Google Chrome event type is mapped to a child sourcetype. For events which do not match a known Chrome event, the sourcetype will remains google:chrome:json (the original sourcetype associated with the HEC token). Child sourcetypes are listed below: 

sourcetype::google:chrome:json:password_reuse
sourcetype::google:chrome:json:password_changed
sourcetype::google:chrome:json:malware_transfer
sourcetype::google:chrome:json:bad_navigation
sourcetype::google:chrome:json:sensitive_data_transfer

This is an add-on powered by the Splunk Add-on Builder.
Overview
The NetApp StorageGRID Add-on for Splunk is used to gather data from NetApp StorageGRID environment, do indexing on it and provide the indexed data to ""NetApp StorageGRID App for Splunk"" which runs searches on indexed data and build dashboards using it.

Note:- User with splunk admin role can configure and access the app-on configuration. If user is not able to view the add-on configuration page then please provide the admin role to the user from Settings -> Access controls -> Users -> Select a User -> Provide admin role -> Save.



Configuring the REST API over secure network connection
Please note that This Add-on supports HTTPS connection and SSL check for communication between Splunk and Netapp StorageGrid out of the box. If the StorageGrid has a self-signed certificate, then to collect data through a secure network channel (with certificate checks), you first need to get the required certs for the successful SSL verification with your StorageGrid. You need to copy the content of the PEM file into: $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA_netapp-sg/bin/ta_netapp_sg/certifi/cacert.pem. Once the certificate is copied to the mentioned location, you need to configure the StorageGrid from the UI as mentioned above in the Configuring REST API section.
Configuring the REST API over insecure network connection
If you want to configure the StorageGrid and collect the data through unencrypted communication (without certificate checks) you must disable the SSL check flag in ta_netapp_sg_settings.conf from local directory.
Follow these steps to disable the SSL check flag:

Create local folder if it is not present under TA_netapp-sg folder.

Create/Update the ta_netapp_sg_settings.conf and add cert_verify parameter under additional_parameters stanza to set the data collection over HTTP without using certificate checks.
[additional_parameters]
cert_verify = 0



Restart the Splunk.

Configure the StorageGrid from the UI as mentioned above in the Configuring REST API section.

2) Configuring StorageGRID AuditLogs**
**2.1) On the StorageGRID System:**

Configure the Audit Client for NFS  (Source: StorageGRID Administrator Guide(Pg. 185) https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2753104).

1.  Start the NFS configuration utility.
        Enter: config_nfs.rb


2.  Add the audit client(To be done for the first time only): 
    a) Enter: add-audit-share. 
       (If you get 'Cannot add share, an audit share already exists.' message then move to step 3. from here.)
    b) When prompted, enter the Splunk IP Address range. IP address ranges must be expressed using a subnet mask in CIDR notation (that is, in a form such as 192.168.110.0/24). 
    c) When prompted, press <Enter>. The NFS configuration utility appears and the default audit share is added.


3.  If more than one Splunk Server is permitted to access the audit share, add the IP address of the server:
    a) Enter: add-ip-to-share. A numbered list of the audit shares configured on the Admin Node is displayed. The audit share is named /var/local/audit/export. 
    b)  Enter the number of the audit share. Enter: <audit_share_number> 
    c)  When prompted, enter the Splunk Server's IP address or IP Address range for the audit share. Enter: <Splunk_Server_IP> . IP address ranges must be expressed using a subnet mask in CIDR notation(that is, in a form such as 192.168.110.0/24). 
    d)  When prompted, press <Enter>. The NFS configuration utility is displayed.  
    e)  For each additional Splunk Server that should have access to the audit share, repeat the above step 3.


4. Optionally, verify your configuration.
    a) Enter: ""validate-config""
        - The services are checked and displayed.
    b) When prompted, press <Enter>. The NFS configuration utility is displayed.


5. Close the NFS configuration utility. 
    Enter: exit

NFS audit Splunk Servers are granted access to an audit share based on their IP address. 
Grant access to the audit share to a new NFS Splunk Server by adding its IP address to the share, or remove an existing Splunk Server by removing its IP address. 
**2.2) On the Splunk Server:**
Linux:
------
NFS Mount the audit share directory using the below syntax for Splunk to read from local:

    mount -t nfs -o proto=tcp,port=2049 StorageGRID_System_IP:Path_to_audit_share local_path_to_mount

Eg. mount -t nfs -o proto=tcp,port=2049 <GRID_IP>:/var/local/audit/export  /usr/local/src/temp/

Windows:
-------
1. To install 'Client Services for NFS', go to the Add/Remove Software wizard in the Control Panel.
Click on Turn Windows features on or off.

OR

=> In windows server 2008 r2
Click Start, point to Administrative Tools, and then click Server Manager.
        - In the left pane, click Roles.
        - Under Roles Summary in the right pane, click Add Roles. The Add Roles Wizard appears. Click Next.
        - Select the File Services check box to install this role on the server, and then click Next.
        - Select the Services for Network File System check box, and then click Next.
        - Confirm your selection, and then click Install.
        - When the installation completes, the installation results appear. Click Close.

=> In command line,

    mount //StorageGrid_system_ip/audit_share_path [Drive_letter]

Eg. mount [options] //<GRID_IP>:/var/local/audit/export H:

=> In windows server 2008 r2:

    mount \\GRID_IP\var\local\audit\export [drive letter]

Monitor audit logs:


To ingest audit log files directly into Splunk follow below mentioned steps:

Navigate to Settings -> Data Inputs -> Files & Directories -> New Local File & Directory.
Select path to the directory mounted above(eg. For linux : /usr/local/src/temp and for windows : \<GRID_IP>\var\local\audit\export) and Select ""Index once"" option then click Next.

Search for ""grid:auditlog"" from the dropdown of Source type

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5365,2022-01-10,07:40:04 AM,Microsoft O365 Email Add-on for Splunk,,"May 28, 2021","Microsoft O365 Email Add-on for Splunk Setup Instructions
The Microsoft O365 Email Add-on for Splunk ingests O365 emails via Microsoft’s Graph API.
Setup
1. This add-on utilises a compliance mailbox to ingest email. In order to set up the compliance mailbox, you must first have a compliance user (a regular user account that we’ve just called compliance here) set up in O365, who also has an email account configured. This user will only be used for this purpose, so take care to limit who has access to this account.
2. Once you have the user setup with their email account, you need to configure an email flow rule as per Here. This rule will bcc every message sent to/from/within the organization to a defined compliance mailbox. After the add-on ingests the emails, they are deleted from the compliance mailbox to prevent email from building up over time (nothing touches the actual users’ mailboxes).
Each compliance mailbox will allow up to 9800 messages to be processed per 10 minute period.  To get more API headroom, you can set up multiple Exchange flow rules to different compliance mailboxes.  You may need to set up multiple App Registrations in Azure along with this, as I can't find a straight answer on how the API limits are calculated.
For example:


Flow rule 1: Sender is external, Recipient is internal- BCC to inbound@domain.com


Flow rule 2: Sender is internal, Recipient is external- BCC to outbound@domain.com


Flow rule 3: Send is internal, Recipient is internal- BCC to internal@domain.com


You can then set up 3 different accounts and inputs in the TA to query each account, which gives us up to 9800 messages per 10 minutes, per account.


To create the email flow rule, browse to the Exchange Admin Center with a user who has permission to administer your O365 Exchange environment.


Select the mail flow option to begin setting up your email flow rule.


On this page, select the + icon and the click on Create a new rule...


Within the new rule creation window, do the following (leave the other options as they are):


a. Name the new rule.
b. Under Apply this rule if… select Apply to all messages (if you want to have more specific email ingest policies, you can tweak this bit to only select the messages you want to ingest.)
c. Under Do the following… select Bcc the message to option, which will bring up the mailbox selection screen.


In the window that pops up, select the compliance mailbox that you created at the beginning of this process. Make sure they are in the box next to add-> and then click ok.


Click save on the rule creation window and in the Warning window that says “Do you want this rule to apply to all future messages?” click Yes to apply your rule. All mail should now be getting bcc’d into your compliance mailbox, ready for ingest.



For any account you set up above, it is recommended to set its deleted items retention period to 1, along with disabling of single item hold via the Exchange Management Shell.  Also confirm that the accounts aren't part of any other retention, in-place hold, or litigation hold policies.  All of these will prevent the messages from actually being purged after they are ingested if the Recoverable Items folder grows too large.
For example, if you named the mailbox Inbound, you would use this command.  Further info is available at Configure Deleted Item retention and Recoverable Items quotas

Set-Mailbox -Identity ""<insert email account here>"" -SingleItemRecoveryEnabled $false -RetainDeletedItemsFor 1

3. The next step is to set up an App Registration under the Azure Portal which exposes the API for use by the Add-on.


Once you are logged into the Azure portal, you need to select App registrations (if you don’t see App registrations, type it into the search bar at the top and select it).


Select New registration to create the new application


Name your application and leave the other options as they are. Now click Register at the bottom to register your application.


In the newly registered application, select API permissions on the left, and then select Add a permission.


Select the Microsoft Graph API.


In the permissions selection area, select Application permissions as we don’t need a signed in user, then in the Select permissions search bar type mail, select the Mail permission group, and assign the Mail.ReadWrite permission (we need to read the emails, and then delete them after we’ve ingested them, hence the write permission). Then click Add permissions at the bottom of the screen to apply these.


If you want to gather distribution list details, you must also add the Group.Read.All, GroupMember.Read.All, and Directory.Read.All permissions.


The default User.Read permission should be left alone in the app.


You must then click Grant admin consent to allow these permissions to work.


Now select Certificates and secrets in the left menu bar, and then click New client secret.


Type in a description for the new client secret, and select an expiry (I’m selecting Never here. If you choose an expiry, remember that the Add-on will stop working when this secret expires. You’ll then need to renew it, or create a new secret and
update the Add-on to get things working again). Click Add.


Copy the value of the client secret as soon as you create it, as it becomes obfuscated once you browse away from the app registration page.


Back under Overview, we want to capture the Client ID and Tenant ID values for use in the Add-on, just like the Client secret from the step above. Copy all of these values down for use in the Add-on setup next.


4. Install the Add-on on your Splunk instance and restart Splunk.


Open up the Add-on and select Configuration, then click on Add to create your account settings.


In Add Account, type in a name (this isn't taken from the Azure setup, just type in a name for reference). Then paste in the Client ID and Client Secret values from the steps above.


Next, click on Inputs to define your inputs for the Add-on and select Create New Input for the O365 Email input type. If you have multiple compliance mailboxes, you can define multiple inputs which would allow you to ingest into different indexes for retention or security
purposes.


In the new Input:


a. Type in a name to reference this input by.
b. Select an interval between 60 and 120 seconds. MS sets a maximum of 10K API calls per 10 minute period per account, so the very maximum we can ingest will be around 1.4M messages over a 24 hour period. Some basic rate limiting procedures have been built into the TA to help keep your API queries below the limits, but please report back if you experience otherwise.
c. Define the Index you want to use within Splunk.
d. Type in the email address for the compliance mailbox you set up at the beginning of this process.
e. Paste in the Tenant ID from the Azure App registration setup.
f. Define how many messages per request get processed.  The TA still attempts ~10K per 10 minute period.  This setting just allows us to tweak the API calls to help avoid API timeouts from MS.  245 per round seems to be safe right now, and results in 4 rounds per request if using a 60 second interval setting.
g. Select which endpoint you are using. For most this will be Worldwide. For US Government customers on GCC
High, select USGovGCCHigh (v1.0.40 and above).
h. If you want to ingest attachment details (file name, file type, size, id, and file hash) select the Get Attachment Info box.
i. If you have chosen the Get Attachment Info option, select the hashing algorithm you want to use.
j. If you want to attempt to extract IOCs (URL, domain, IPv4, and IPv6) from email bodies select Extract Body IOCs.
k. If you want to detect and analyse macros within Office file type attachments, select Macro Analysis (requires ingest attachment details to be selected).
l. If you want to ingest the entire message body (observe the warning in relation to large ingest), select the Get Body option.
m. If you just want to ingest a preview (the first 255 characters) of the message body, select the Get Body Preview Box.
n. To show the various MTAs that the message has hopped through before getting to the end user, select the Show Relays option.
o. To ingest all Internet Headers for the email select Get Internet Headers (sub results are selectable as well
just below).
p. If you want to show the auth results data for the message, select Get Auth Results.
q. If you want to show the SPF results data for the message, select Get SPF Results.
r. If you want to show the DKIM signature data for the message, select Get DKIM Signature.
s. If you want to show the entire X-Headers from the message, select Get X Headers.
t. Select the App Account that you defined in the App Configuration tab.
u. Click add to complete the Add-on setup process.
5. If you want to gather distribution lists, you can add the O365 Email Groups input.

Click on Inputs to define your inputs for the Add-on and select Create New Input for the O365 Email input type.

a. Type in a name to reference this input by.
b. Select an interval greater than 600 seconds (you should probably set this to something like 86400 seconds to only retrieve groups once per day though).
c. Define the Index you want to use within Splunk.
d. Paste in the Tenant ID from the Azure App registration setup.
e. Select which endpoint you are using. For most this will be Worldwide. For US Government customers on GCC
High, select USGovGCCHigh (v1.0.40 and above).
f. Select the App Account that you defined in the App Configuration tab.
g. Click add to complete the Add-on setup process.
6. If the Add-on is working, any emails accumulated in the compliance mailbox should now start disappearing while being ingested into Splunk. To confirm, search in your defined index for sourcetype=ms:o365:email
For distributed installs, this must be installed on search heads, indexers and heavy forwarders. Configure the add-on on the heavy forwarder or the search head (if you aren't using heavy forwarders), but only on one of them. Leave the add-on unconfigured on the indexing tier.",Version 2.2.7,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/1b20e35a-bf4d-11eb-9f77-06382f3616cf.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-general-terms.html,"1,333",0,splunk,0,0,Splunk Works,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/splunklabs,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

Introduction
The LiveAction for Splunk App is a long term monitoring and reporting solution for LiveAction LiveWire. With the LiveAction for Splunk App, many different kinds of network and application statistics and hundreds of different types of events events from one or more Capture Engines can be viewed in dashboards as an aggregated set or individually. Within the dashboards, any range of time can be chosen, and statistics and events from different times can be compared. 
Although we believe the dashboards provided are useful, we look at them as a starting point, and users are encouraged to customize, enhance, and clone the dashboards to create their own.  The wealth of statistics and events from Capture Engines can also be correlated with other data in completely different dashboards. This is when the insight happens about how the network affects other aspects of the business, and vice versa. 
The LiveAction for Splunk App does require a physical of virtual LiveWire server.
Components
The LiveAction for Splunk App builds on the ability of the Capture Engine to output events and statistics as CSV files at specified intervals, and have them ingested into a Splunk Server. The LiveAction for Splunk solution consists of a Capture Engine and a Splunk Server. 
On the machine running the capture engine there is a Splunk Forwarder and a Savvius Technology Add-on (TA).  The Splunk Forwarder is a utility available for Windows and Linux that is offered for free by Splunk. The Splunk Forwarder forwards data from the Capture Engine to the Splunk Server. The Capture Engine and the Splunk Forwarder are always installed onto the same machine. The TA is the package that tells the Splunk Forwarder where to find the CSV files, and what to do with them. There are 2 TA’s, one for Windows and one Linux. Both TA’s are on Splunkbase, and the SplunkForwarder is on the Splunk website. 
The LiveAction for Splunk App installed into a Splunk Server. The Splunk Server can be installed onto the same machine as the Capture Engine, but it is recommend to run the Splunk Server on a different machine. The Splunk Server is also offered is a cloud service called Splunk Cloud, so the LiveAction for Splunk Dashboards can be installed in the cloud as well.
Splunk Forwarder and LiveAction Technology Add-ons
The Splunk Forwarder and the Splunk Server index the CSV reports generated by a Capture Engine. In order to generate CSV reports that the SplunkForwarder will find, the capture must be named “Splunk”, and both Analysis Options and Statistics Output have to be enabled. Setting up the Splunk Forwarder to index the CSV files is described below for both Windows and Linux.  The only difference between Windows and Linux is which TA package to use.
Linux TA   - https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2746/
Windows TA - https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2747/
Splunk Server
The Splunk Server indexes the data coming from the Capture Engines, and stores the data.  The data from each of the CSV files is stored into a different custom index. For example, the protocol statistics are stored in the index called “sv_protocols”, and the nodes statistics are stored in the index called “sv_nodes”, and the flows are in “sv_flows”, and so on. This makes it possible to display the data for a particular index by typing “index=nodes” or “index=protocols” into the Splunk search field.
Warning: The creation and growth of these indexes will use disk space.
Savvius for Splunk App
The Savvius for Splunk App provides dashboards in the Splunk UI that display network statistics from one or more Capture Engines. There are high level dashboards like the Network Dashboard, Security Dashboard, and VOIP Dashboard, which display trends about the network and the events taking place on it.  There are also lower level dashboards that display list of network activity like nodes, flows, and protocols. All of the dashboards are completely web-based and can be customized and extended in many ways.
Splunk Licensing
The Splunk license pricing model is usage based. The free license allows up to 500MBs per day of data to be indexed. More data can be indexed by purchasing a license. Splunk offers perpetual licenses and a term license. More on Splunk licenses can be found here:  https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/pricing.html.

Normal app installation can be followed from https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/Overview/AboutSplunkadd-ons. Essentially download app and install from Web UI or extract file in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps folder.
Usage
To add a SSH action to an alert, go to the Alerts tab in the Search app and find applicable alert. Click Edit, and select Edit Actions. Click + Add Actions and select either of the SSH actions available. Fill out the attributes for the connection and action. Note that username and passwords get stored in cleartext in savedsearches.conf so it is recommended to used authorized keys instead. The add-on has the option to save this for you automatically by turning on ""Auto Add Host to KnownHosts"" or by manually from the search head editing the ~/.ssh/known_hosts (make a connection first and the OS will offer to save it as well).
When using SSH Command alert action, it is recommended to use sudo and read the documentation for sudo at https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.8.27/sudoers.man.html. An example command placed either in /etc/sudoers or in a new file like so /etc/sudoers.d/10_splunk may look like this:
splunk ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl restart ntpd
Then the ssh command to call it in the Splunk alert would be:

Splunk users can easily request data from Splunk Administrators usings the Request Data feature of the Data Management App. This is a convenient way for Users and Administrators to collaborate during the data onboarding process and gives Administrators a method for providing a robust set of metadata for each index sourcetype. This helps Administrators with data sprawl problems so that they can understand why the data is being ingested into Splunk and who owns it.
Data Inventory
The Data Inventory feature brings all of the ingested data sources together in one view and illuminates the events and data ingest sizing so that Administrators can see which data sources are being used.
Data Watch
The Data Watch feature is part of Data Inventory which allows Splunk Administrators to automatically setup monitoring of data sources with one click. This will allow Administrators to easily monitor and be alerted when critical data sources go offline.
Data Management
Data Management provides a User Interface for Splunk users to request and Splunk Administrator to track all data onboarding requests. From Data Management, you can review all data currently ingested into the Splunk system to give Admins visibility into the data that exists in their system. Lastly, it provides an easy way for Admins to alert upon their most critical data sources with the click of a button.  
Key Features
- Create a meaningful inventory of the data that you are ingesting into your Splunk environment. 
- Provide an automated workflow management tool for users to request data that they want to be ingested into Splunk. 
- Track ownership of indexes and sourcetypes that you have coming into your Splunk environment. 
- Correlates index and sourcetype information back to ingest rates and license consumption. 
- User friendly interface that makes day-to-day data onboarding much easier. 
- Automatically create an alert for monitoring critical data feeds in your Splunk environment.",,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/fff02924-da81-11eb-b959-0a58b5c6f36b.png,Utilities,,20,0,splunk,5,12,Kinney Group,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/atlasproductteam,

NTPDrifter is a splunkapp that you deploy to a universal forwarder to measure the NTP drift between the
servers local clock and the time given by your local NTP source.
It does not correct for any time difference, it just tells you what it is so you can do somthing about it.
Some suggested Ways to use the data are given at the bottom of this readme.
Version History:

v1.0 24th Nov 2012 - Initial release
v1.2 29th Nov 2012 - Removed Client/location specifc dependancies/quirks for upload to splunkbase
v1.3 6th  Aug 2013 - Numerous spelling corrections,alert search syntax tweak, update for release of new Splunk Apps site.

Tested ok on:
Windows XP Professional
Windows 7
Windows 2003 R2
Windows 2008 R2
Requirements:
cscript.exe must be available on your target hosts
NTP Source hostname must be edited into the VB script as indicated.
Target hosts must be able to query NTP ie no firewall.
CAUTION - Standard disclaimer applies in this case.
This script/SplunkApp has no brain, so you must use your own before executing it.
I accept no liablilty for damage to your or any one elses computer network system as a result of using this app.
You use this app at your own risk.
Copyright 2012
Conradejohnston@gmail.com
Deployment:
Deploy using deployment server to target your windows servers as required.
Splunk Requirements:
The app will write its data to an index named ""windows_perfmon""
Sourcetype is ntp_drift
I have the interval set to 360s. This way you can see the servers drifting inbetween NTP sync operations
All these settings can be changed to suit your situation and needs.
The location of the script is assumed to be the default install location.
Usage: ##
General Purpose Daily Report
Generate a daily report style email giving you the top n-outliers in either direction.
index=windows_perfmon sourcetype=""ntp_drift"" host=""<HOSTMASK>"" | head 500 | dedup host | rex ""(?i):ntpDrift=(?P<ntpDrift>[^\]]+)"" | sort +ntpDrift, +host | reverse | head 10 | append [ search index=windows_perfmon sourcetype=""ntp_drift"" host=""ps*"" | head 500 | dedup host | rex ""(?i):ntpDrift=(?P<ntpDrift>[^\]]+)"" | sort +ntpDrift, +host | head 10 | sort -ntpDrift ] | table host, ntpDrift
Configure this as a scheduled search that emails you once a day. Thius way you get the benefit of a daily heath report and get to see what the extreme outliers are.
Targetted Alert
If you don't want a daily repor; You could configure an alert to only notify you whenever a host or hosts exceed a maximum variance from source for a given time.
Historical Tracking
The data can also be graphed overtime to show how well (or not so well) your servers are tracking and whether you need tweak your NTP polling periods. Interesting to see that not all servers track time as closely asor uniformly as you might think!.
index=windows_perfmon sourcetype=""ntp_drift"" host=""<HOSTMASK>"" | eval host=lower(host) | rex ""(?i):ntpDrift=(?P<ntpDrift>[^\]]+)"" | timechart span=6min max(ntpDrift) by host
Choose line chart, labels and time period to suit. Long time periods may reuqire you to tweak the span component to reduce data points.  (see example screenshot - hostnames blurred for modesty)

Overview
Homepage presents logged in users with a 'virtual cockpit' that provides a single-pane-of-glass view into their specific use of Splunk. It does this through the use of a central home page, tailored to the user, that provides insight into the indexes and sourcetypes they have access to, the search jobs they have run, the saved searches and dashboards they have created and the apps they have permission to access. Users are able to dynamically drill-down into more details, re-run searches and jobs, or immediately search specific data sources. All this is done leveraging a simple point-and-click driven approach.
The app is designed to be a useful utility, shared globally across Splunk applications that can leverage it as the default home page for their app.
Benefits
The app provides the following benefits:
- Presents users with a virtual cockpit into Splunk, providing at-a-glance key information tailored to the logged in user
- Greatly aids in a users understanding of Splunk, the data sources they can access and their specific search activity
- The point-and-click driven approach simplifies the Splunk learning curve and allows users to search data without typing anything
- The use of drill-down allows for additional relevant information to be displayed
- REST driven approach provides extremely fast performance without the need to search indexed data
- Tested to work at scale with both environments consisting of 100s of Splunk users and smaller environments of a few users
- Can be centrally administered and deployed across many apps in a Splunk environment as the default home page for those apps
Getting Started
Homepage provides 4 dashboards consisting of a main Homepage dashboard and three supplementary drill down dashboards as follows:
- Homepage (homepage.xml) - the main homepage customized and tailored to the logged in user
- Sourcetype Field Listing (homepage_sourcetype_fields.xml) - linked to from Homepage to provide a listing of fields and values for a given sourcetype
- Saved Searches Listing (homepage_saved_searches_listing.xml) - linked to from Homepage to provide a listing of saved searches authored by the logged in user
- Adhoc Searches Listing (homepage_adhoc_searches_listing.xml) - linked to from Homepage to provide a listing of adhoc searches performed by the logged in user
Initial Install
The following steps will help you get the app set up.
1. Install the app from splunkbase.
2. Restart Splunk
Points to note:
- The app is purposely hidden, as the home dashboard is designed to be accessed via other apps, not the Homepage app itself
- The app is purposely set with global permissions, in order to ensure the Homepage dashboards are accessible from other apps
- The app will generate a lookup of sourcetypes and indexes upon a restart
Set the Homepage dashboard to be the homepage of an App
The following steps can be followed to set the Homepage dashboard as the home page of any app.
1. Navigate to the Splunk App that you wish to have Homepage as the home page for.
2. Go to Settings --> User Interface --> Navigation Menus
3. Click to edit the ""default"" navigation of the app
4. Under the <nav> XML group, add the following line:
<view name=""homepage"" default=""true"" />

Remove any other default=""true"" that might be in the file, then click Save.
Navigate back to the app and you will now see that the Homepage page appears as the homepage for the app. There will also be a ""Homepage"" link is present at the top left of the application's menu bar.

Requirements
The following requirements exist for this app:
-    Works with Splunk Enterprise version 6.4.x and higher
-   Designed to be installed on a single SH or a SHC
-   Tested to work with the default Splunk User and Power roles. Other custom roles that do not inherit these roles may need similar capabilities.

Select each sourcetype to see how it affects the data being parsed, allowing you to check that the timestamps and line-breaking is correct before your data is indexed.  The app uses over 600 sourcetypes, but don't worry you don't have to try all 600! :)  The app automatically shows you only the sourcetypes that match your data, then it deduplicates sourcetypes that behave the same on your data, and finally it sorts the sourcetypes by popularity.

About this App
Installation and Configuration
Software requirements
Splunk Enterprise system requirements
Because this App runs on Splunk Enterprise, all of the Splunk Enterprise system requirements apply.
Download
Download Campus Compliance Toolkit for NIST 800-171 at https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3828/.
Prerequisites
This app requires the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) Add-on to be installed. For information regarding the installation of the CIM Add-on, please see the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on documentation.
Deploy to single server instance
Follow these steps to install the app in a single server instance of Splunk Enterprise:

Deploy as you would any App, and restart Splunk.
Configure.

Deploy to Splunk Cloud

Contact Splunk Cloud Support for assistance with the installation.

Deploy to a Distributed Environment

This app should be distributed only to search heads on which you would like to use this app.

Search Head Clustering

This app should be compatible with Splunk Search Head Clustering.

Data Model Acceleration
While not required, it is highly recommended, and the default, to use Data Model Acceleration with this App, for performance reasons. See the Data Models section for more information about which data models should be accelerated.
A note on Splunk Data Model Acceleration and Disk Space
This app requires data model acceleration, which will use additional disk space. If you are using the Splunk App for Enterprise Security, this is already enabled, and should have been factored into your retention policies. If not, you should review the documentation on data model acceleration, how it uses disk space, and how to plan for it. This documentation can be found here: Data Model Summary Size On Disk.
User Guide
Key concepts for Campus Compliance Toolkit for NIST 800-171
This app is designed to assist organizations with reaching compliance with the NIST 800-171 standards. Where Splunk can be applied to these standards, dashboards have been created using the Common Information Model for normalizing event data. This means that for the app to provide dashboard results, your data must be properly onboarded, and have the appropriate tags to be consumed by the data model. See the Data Model Acceleration section of the documentation for more information, as well as the table for individual controls.
Data Models
This app uses the following Data Models:

Application_State
Authentication
Change_Analysis
Intrusion_Detection
Malware
Network_Sessions
Network_Traffic
Performance
Updates
Vulnerabilities
Web

Macros
The following macros can be used to configure the app.
cc_allowed_ports
Contains the name of the lookup which states which ports are considered allowed for reports.
cc_get_indexers
Contains a search pattern which returns the indexers for the environment.
cc_get_searchheads
Contains a search pattern which returns the search heads for the environment.
cc_inactive_time
Contains the time span, in seconds after which an account is considered inactive. Defaults to 31536000 seconds (one year).
cc_internal_ranges
Returns a search pattern which indicated which traffic is considered internal traffic. Takes an argument which should be the field name which is being compared (src, dest, src_ip, dest_ip).
cc_max_review_age
Contains the time span, in seconds, which is considered the review period for the control dashboards in the application. Defaults to 172800 seconds (two days).
cc_prestats
Used to control how the tstats command, when using prestats option, is called within the application.
cc_priv_lookup
Contains the definition of a lookup which contains the list of users which is considered privileged in the environment.
cc_timeSync_allowance
Contains the time span, in seconds, in which is expected systems will synchronize time. Defaults to 86400 (one day).
cc_tstats
Used to control how the tstats command, when not using prestats option, is called within the application.
Lookups
The following lookups can be used to configure the app.
cc_allowed_ports
File name: cc_allowed_ports.csv
This lookup is used for controlling which network ports are considered allowed when viewing reports. The dvc field is wild-carded to allow for the creation of allowed ports across multiple devices.
cc_allowed_processes
File name: cc_allowed_processes.csv
This lookup is used for controlling which processes are considered allowed when viewing reports. The dest field is wild-carded to allow for whitelisting processes across multiple destinations.
cc_priv_users
File name: cc_priv_users.csv
A list of users which are considered privileged users in the applicable environment.
cc_splunk_data_controls
File name: cc_splunk_data_controls.csv

The python script is default configured to query every 5 minutes.  The first call (which starts from your first checkin) will obviously be a long one.  To alter the frequency, change interval under the 4sqdata stanza in inputs.conf.  The API token can also be amended there (my4sqAPItoken).

NOTES

This app consists primarily of a single huge dashboard running 75 real-time searches and two event generators in Python which produce data for the dashboard to visualize.
The app is designed to emulate interactive display screens as seen on Martian Congressional Republic Navy vessels, as an exercise in ""what is possible"" with the new dashboarding functionality in Splunk v8.

INSTALL

Get the Splunk Enterprise Dashboards Beta app before you try to install MCRN SYSLOG.
Install of MCRN SYSLOG is fairly self-explanatory.
After the initial installation, you will be prompted to restart Splunk so the app's images and such can be loaded for the dashboard.
Next, you'll want to enable the Backlog for loading, on the app's Setup page. It is initially turned off so that it will not run prior to the required restart.



UTILIZE THE MCRN SYSLOG DISPLAY CONSOLE

The default homepage of the app will take you to the dashboard.
THIS DASHBOARD RUNS 75 REAL-TIME SEARCHES. Make sure your server can handle it.
The searches may need a minute to catch up. Best to grab a coffee or a märzen after you click Restart, so it has a couple minutes to load. If for some reason you get a bunch of No Results Found which won't go away, go to Activity > Jobs and stop all the running Jobs, then load the dashboard again.",Version 1.1.1,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/53521584-75e6-11ea-804b-0a9c9ef27d38.png,"Utilities, IoT & Industrial Data",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,105,0,splunk,5,2,Aaron Chandler,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/splunkConsultant,"Products: Splunk Enterprise

This is an example Splunk App to demonstrate how to use setup views that adhere to Splunk Application Certification standards.
Setup View Entry Point
Splunk will automatically try to redirect the user to the setup page if the app.conf's [install] stanza has its is_configured property set to false.
Program Flow
This program starts in the app.conf, where the [install] stanza's is_configured property is set to false. This causes Splunk to redirect to it's setup page that is specified so that an admin/user can configure it for use.
In the app.conf's, [ui] stanza there is a setup_view property that points to which resource should be used for the setup view. In this case it's pointing to default/data/ui/views/setup_view_dashboard.xml.
The dashboard view specifies its CSS and JavaScript resources and points to the two file in appserver/static/javascript/setup_page.js and appserver/static/styles/setup_page.css.
And finally the setup_page.js imports a custom Backbone view from the appserver/static/javascript/views/setup_view_example.js.

Version 1.0.0
WHAT DOES THIS APP DO?
This app provides a SPL command (| opendns) to query the Investigate API
provided by OpenDNS. You must have a valid API key from OpenDNS in order
for this App to work.
Once the data is queried from the Investigate API, it's stored in the
opendns_cache KV Store configured by this App.
REQUIREMENTS/INSTALLATION
1. Determine KV Store Instance
If you don't already have a dedicated KV Store instance in your
environment, then pick one (ideally a Search Head) to house the cache
KV Store for this App (opendns_cache).
By default, the opendns_cache KV Store is defined by this App. If you
decide to house it on another instance, you will need to define that
server address in the config.ini dicussed below.
2. Service user access
There will need to be a user with access to the KV Store created, and
those credentials along with the server address are stored in the
config.ini file discussed below.
2. Install the OpenDNS Detective App
The App should be placed on a Search Head, in the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps
folder. The Search Heads will distribute the command to the Indexers as
part of Splunk's default behavior.
3. Configure the OpenDNS Detective App
A) Create a directory in the App named: local
   B) Copy the config.ini from the default directory to the new local
      directory created in the step before this one.
   C) Edit the config.ini file in the local directory.
   D) Restart Splunk

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3833,2022-01-10,07:42:24 AM,Technology Add-on for Violin FSP,,"Jan. 22, 2018","REQUIREMENTS

Splunk version 6.5.x and 6.6.x
Violin FSP 7000 series.
If using a forwarder, it must be a UNIVERSAL forwarder on concerto.

A Heavy forwarder to collect data from Violin FSP platform using REST API. Same heavy forwarder can also be used to receive forwarded logs from universal forwarder and forward them to indexer.


Appropriate User ID and password for collecting data from Violin Concerto using REST API.


RECOMMENDED SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

Splunk forwarder system should have 4 GB of RAM and a quad-core CPU to run this Technology Add-on smoothly.

TOPOLOGY AND SETTING UP SPLUNK ENVIRONMENT

This app has been distributed in two parts.

1) Add-on app, which runs collector scripts and gathers data from Violin FSP, does indexing on it and provides indexed data to Main app.
  2) Main app, which receives indexed data from Add-on app, runs searches on it and builds dashboard using indexed data.


This App can be set up in two ways:
  1) Standalone Mode: Install main app and Add-on app on a single machine. This single machine would serve as a Search Head + Indexer + Heavy forwarder for this setup

Here both the app resides on a single machine.
Add-on needs to be installed on Concerto's Universal forwarder and start forwarding data to standalone splunk server.
Main app uses the data collected by Add-on.



2) Distributed Environment: Install main app and Add-on on search head and Add-on on Heavy forwarder (for REST API) and universal forwarder (for log collection).
 * Here also both the app resides on search head machine, but no need to configure Add-on on search head.
 * Only Add-on needs to be installed and configured on Heavy forwarder system and universal forwarder.
 * Execute the following command on Heavy forwarder to forward the collected data to the indexer.
   /opt/splunk/bin/splunk add forward-server <indexer_ip_address>:9997
 * On Indexer machine, enable event listening on port 9997 (recommended by Splunk).
 * Main app on search head uses the received data and builds dashboards on it.

INSTALLATION OF APP

This app can be installed through UI using ""Manage Apps"" or extract zip file directly into /opt/splunk/etc/apps/ folder.

CONFIGURATION OF APP
REST API Events:

After installation, Go to Settings->Data inputs->Violin Systems REST Input Modular. The set up screen will open which will ask for Violin Systems Concerto credentials. Provide host, username, password for Concerto and save them.
Splunk REST API will encrypt the password and store it in Add-on's folder itself in encrypted form, REST modular script will fetch these credentials through REST API to connect to the Violin FSP.

Concerto logs

On Concerto, user needs to configure log collection and forwarding to Heavy forwarder/Indexer. Since universal forwarder doesn't have front end UI enabled, user needs to first extract TA_violin-fsp.tar.gz at $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps.
Technology Add-on contains settings in inputs.conf.example to monitor the var/log/messages and callhome.log file but it is kept disabled by default.
Copy inputs.conf.example from TA_violin-fsp/README/ to TA_violin-fsp/local/ folder
Rename inputs.conf.example file under location TA_violin-fsp/local/ to inputs.conf
By default these monitor stanzas are disabled, user has to make all disabled = 0
If user doesn't want to install whole TA on universal forwarder then follow below manual configuration:
Add inputs.conf with monitoring stanzas at /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local/

Add below monitoring stanzas in inputs.conf
[monitor:///var/log/messages]
sourcetype = violin:fsp:mglogs
disabled = 0
[monitor:///var/log/acm]
sourcetype = violin:fsp:acmlogs
disabled = 0
[monitor:///PRODUCT/concerto/log/callhome/callhome.log]
sourcetype = violin:fsp:mglogs
disabled = 0


Execute the following command on Heavy forwarder to forward the collected data to the indexer/Heavy forwarder.
       /opt/splunk/bin/splunk add forward-server <indexer_ip_address/heavy_forwarder_ip>:9997
       Depending on the receiver in above command user needs to enable event listening on port 9997 either on heavy forwarder or on Indexer.

Restart Splunk

TEST YOUR INSTALL
The main app dashboard can take some time to populate the dashboards, once data collection is started. A good test to see that you are receiving all of the data we expect is to run this search after several minutes:
search `get_vm_index` | stats count by sourcetype

In particular, you should see these sourcetypes:
 violin:fsp:rest
 violin:fsp:mglogs
* violin:fsp:acmlogs
If you don't see these sourcetypes, have a look at the messages for ""violin:fsp:rest"" .User can see logs at $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/violin/violin_fsp.log file.
SAMPLE EVENT GENERATOR

The TA_violin-fsp, comes with sample data files, which can be used to generate sample data for testing. In order to generate sample data it requires SA-Eventgen application. The TA will generate sample data of rest api calls at an interval of 10 minutes and sample data of log files at an interval of 4 hours. You can update this configuration from eventgen.conf file available under $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/default/.

TROUBLESHOOTING
After completing installation of application, all the dashboards will start populating data. 
1)    In case you don’t see data in the dashboards, use following steps for troubleshooting.
•   Confirm that you have modified macro get_vm_index with indexes selected while creating Modular input. 
1   To verify this go to Settings->Data inputs->Violin Systems REST Input Modular.
2   Check index field for each entry in list view.
3   If index=default, then splunk will take default index, which is ‘main’
4   Now go to Settings-> Advance search -> Search macros
5   Open entry with name get_vm_index and verify definition. It must have definition on index verified in 2nd step
For example, If all modular input entries have index=default in 2nd step, then update macro definition with index=main and save.
If any specific index has been set in modular input then add it in macro definition. 
•   Check following query to verify data is getting indexed into Splunk
search get_vm_index | stats count by sourcetype
•   Verify that SPLUNK_HOME is pointing to correct Splunk directory.
•   Look for errors in vioin_fsp.log file.  This file will be available under $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/violin folder. 
2)  In case password of MG get modified after setup in modular input.
User can update password from Modular input UI
•   Go to Settings-> Data Inputs -> Violin Systems REST Modular Input
•   Open specific MG entry, and enter new password in password field.
•   On click of save, password will get updated for that specific MG
3)  In case user deletes modular input of MG, and still entry of that MG is there in FSP filters of dashboards.
On setup of MG in modular input, it starts indexing data for that MG. Once data is indexed in Splunk, it stays in the database forever. We are populating the lookup file based on last 2 hours of data and using that lookup file to populate the dropdown of FSP. Since the old data is indexed, the drop down will keep using it for 2 hours till the 2 hours window is passed and deleted MG entry is out of the window. This is Splunk’s way of doing things. We are just using the framework. 
You could avoid this issue by executing following steps:
•   Remove the lookup file at location /opt/splunk/etc/apps/ violin-app-fsp/lookups/FSP_Mapping
•   Go to Settings->Searches, Reports and Alerts
•   Open “VMEM_FSP_Mapping” saved search by clicking on it and replace search. See highlighted part, replace example ip with the one you have deleted
get_vm_index  sourcetype=""violin:fsp:rest""  source=""violin://*/concerto/server/config/xml"" NOT node=""192.168.81.56"" | dedup System_Serial_Number | table node Server | rename Server as fsp_name | outputlookup FSP_MappingLookup
•   Click save and then click on Run action to execute this modified search. This will populate lookup again and exclude specific mg entry mentioned in query
•   Wait till 2 hours window is passed and put the original query back else leave it as is. It won’t affect anything.

This application template provides visualizations, reports, and searches for Google Cloud Platform data gathered utilizing the Splunk Add-on for Google Cloud Platform, Cloud Functions (see https://github.com/splunk/gcp_functions) or GCP DataFlow Splunk Template. The purpose of this application template is to provide a starting point for various use cases involving GCP data.  Add to, delete from, and modify this template to fit your own requirements.
Correlate other data sources with GCP Data to provide greater Operational or Security Intelligence.
Note - Metrics data can be collected in 3 ways depending on your requirements - GCP Add-On (Event), Cloud Functions (Event or Metrics Store), Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring Add-On.
Each dashboard has the flexibility to allow for different collection and indexing methods. The reason for the need for this flexibility is that the format of the json data collected from PubSub differs between the Add-on and DataFlow - an additional ""data."" prefix layer is present with json content from the Add-On. Also, for performance reasons, it may be beneficial to use indexed extractions for the json content, which will allow for faster searches with tstats - the dashboards can be configured to use either standard and tstats searches. (see below for setup instructions)
Where metrics are required, it is possible to use metrics collected via the Add-On, Cloud functions (into metrics store), or by pulling from Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring using the SIM Add-On.
Pre-requisites / Dependencies:
Install the Google Cloud Platform Add-on for the knowledge objects. https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3088/
Add-Ons / Collection methods
This GCP App supports data to be collected into Splunk via the following methods:
1) Splunk Add-On for Google Cloud Platform (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3088/)
All Data collection methods/sources supported (PubSub, Metrics, GCS)
2) GCP DataFlow. https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/connect-to-splunk-with-a-dataflow-template
All Data collected supported. (pre-install the GCP Add-On, and ensure all sourcetypes for HEC are set to the correct values)
3) Cloud Functions https://github.com/splunk/gcp_functions
All Data collected supported. (pre-install the GCP Add-On, and ensure all sourcetypes for HEC are set to the correct values)
4) Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring Add-on (SIM) https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5247/
All Metrics collected by SIM supported
Follow the instructions for these collection methods before setting up this app.
You will need assets information via Cloud Functions (see https://github.com/splunk/gcp_functions), or by using gcloud command / cron schedule (https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/exporting-to-cloud-storage). For assets data, make sure you use the assets sourcetype below. (additional information is available here - https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/partners/taking-inventory-of-your-google-cloud.html)
Setup / Installation
Macros
The GCP app requires some initial setup of macros to work with your Splunk environment. Set the macro settings according to the tables below:
(Note that the current macro settings for the app can be viewed on the ""setup"" page on the App - if these are blank/empty, you will need to set them to the correct values before the dashboards work)
Splunk Add-On for Google Cloud Platform
If you are collecting the GCP Pub-Sub data via the GCP Add-On, and also collecting metrics via the Add-On, then you will need to set the following :

MacroValue (and default)Description
gcp_indexindex=gcp_indexSets the index where the GCP Data will be stored by the Add-On
datatagaddonAdds ""data."" as a JSON wrapper for PubSub Data
metricstagaddonSets the dashboards to use event based metrics from the Add-On
gcp_metricsindex=gcp_metricsSets the event index where the add-on stores the metrics
gcp_assets_index`gcp_index`Sets the event index where the asset information is stored. Default is set as the value for the gcp_index macro to be backward compatible

(note that if you are collecting metrics via Cloud Functions into Metrics store or using SIM, then the two metrics macros need to be set per the instructions below)
DataFlow
If you are using DataFlow (without transformations) to collect the data from PubSub with no compatibilty settings, then change the following. (note if you use compatibilty, you do not need to change this, and keep as addon):

MacroValueDescription
datatagdataflowThe payload from PubSub isn't ""wrapped"" by ""data."" by default.

SIM / SignalFX
If you are using the SIM / SignalFX (Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring) to collect metrics from GCP, you will need to use and configure connections on the SIM Add-On - https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5247/
Then set the following:

MacroValueDescription
metricstagsimSets the dashboards to use metrics collected from SIM / SignalFX using the Add-On

Cloud Functions
PubSub: Cloud Functions can send data in either Add-On or DataFlow formats - refer to the function documentation for details, and set the macros accordingly.
Metrics: Cloud Functions can send metrics in either Add-On format (event index) or into Metrics Store. If you are collecting metrics into the event index, use the same settings as the Add-On, otherwise if using the metrics store, use the following:

MacroValueDescription
metricstagmetricsSets the dashboards to use metrics store
gcp_metricsindex=gcp_metricsEnsure that this index is a METRICS index not event

Search Performance
If you want to have significantly faster searches using indexed json extractions with tstats, you will need to set the following:
(default is notstats)

MacroValue
tstatstagusetstats

Note also that you will need to apply props.conf and transforms.conf updates to your local GCP-Add-on settings to apply this setting, as it requires indexed extractions. (see below).
Setting this macro (keeping default) to ""notstats"" will use standard searches, but will provide slower ""standard"" search performance, but will not require any changes to your GCP Add-On configuration.
Props/Transforms
If you want to use tstats based searches for faster performance, you will need to apply these changes to your props.conf / transforms.conf in the local directory of the GCP Add-On.
props.conf

The Illumio App for Splunk integrates with the Illumio Policy Compute Engine (PCE) to provide security and operational insights into your Illumio secured data center. A dashboard view displays an overview of the security posture of the data center. 
With improved visibility of east-west traffic, Security Operations Center (SOC) staff can detect unauthorized activity and potential attacks from traffic blocked by Illumio segmentation policy on workloads in ""Enforcement"" mode. Additionally, the Illumio App for Splunk provides visibility into potentially blocked traffic for workloads in ""Test"" mode. SOC staff can quickly pinpoint potential attacks and identify workloads with a significant number of blocked flows.

TOPOLOGY AND SETTING UP SPLUNK ENVIRONMENT


This app has been distributed in two parts.
1) Add-on app, which listens for Syslog messages from Illumio PCE and collects Illumio metadata using REST API Calls.
2) The main app for visualizing Illumio PCE data.


This App can be set up in two ways:


1) Standalone Mode:
Install the main app and Add-on app.

Here both the app resides on a single machine.
The main app uses the data collected by Add-on app and builds dashboard on it.

2) Distributed Environment: 
a) With heavy forwarder

Install the main app and Add-on app on search head. Add-on app on heavy forwarder.

* Configure Add-on app on heavy forwarder.
* The main app on search head uses the received data and builds dashboards on it.

b) With Splunk Universal Forwarder

Install the main app and Add-on app on search head. Add-on app on universal forwarder and indexer.

1. Configure Splunk Universal Forwarder to collect data from Illumio Server.
    * Create TCP stanza in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/inputs.conf file.
        ```
        [tcp://<PORT>]
        index=<INDEX-NAME>
        sourcetype=illumio:pce
        ```              
2. Configure the Splunk Universal Forwarder to send the data to Splunk Indexer.
    * Execute below command on SUF.
         * $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk add forward­server <IP>:<PORT> (Splunk Indexer IP and Listening Port)

3. Configure Splunk Indexer to receive data from SUF.
    * Create below stanza in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/inputs.conf file.
        ```
        [splunktcp://<PORT>]
        ```

INSTALLATION IN SPLUNK CLOUD

Same as on-premise setup.

INSTALLATION OF APP

This app can be installed through UI using ""Manage Apps"" or from the command line using the following command:
sh
    $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk install app $PATH_TO_SPL/IllumioAppforSplunk.spl/
User can directly extract SPL file into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ folder.

DATA MODEL

The app consist of one data model ""Illumio"". The acceleration for the data model is disabled by default. If you want to improve the performance of dashboards then enable the data model acceleration.
The accelerated data models help in improving the performance of the dashboard but it increases the disk usage on the indexer.

DATA MODEL CONFIGURATION

The Data Model used in this application is not accelerated. Admin should manually accelerate the Data Model.
The Data Model used in this application should be accelerated with 1 week's period. Admin can enable/disable acceleration or change the acceleration period by the following steps:
On Splunk’s menu bar, Click on Settings -> Data models
From the list for Data models, click “Edit” in the ""Action"" column of the row for the Data model for which acceleration needs to be enabled or disabled.
From the list of actions select Edit Acceleration. This will display the pop-up menu for Edit Acceleration.
Check or uncheck Accelerate checkbox to ""Enable"" or ""Disable"" data model acceleration respectively.
If acceleration is enabled, select the summary range to specify acceleration period.
To save acceleration changes click on save button.



REBUILDING DATA MODEL

In case there is no need to use the already indexed accelerated Data Model, the Data Model can be configured to rebuild from scratch for the specified acceleration period. Data Model can be rebuilt by the following steps:
On Splunk’s menu bar, Click on Settings -> Data models.
From the list for Data models, expand the row by clicking “>"" arrow in the first column of the row for the Data model for which acceleration needs to be rebuild. This will display an extra Data Model information in ""Acceleration"" section.
From the ""Acceleration"" section click on ""Rebuild"" link.
Monitor the status of ""Rebuild"" in the field ""Status"" of ""Acceleration"" section. Reload the page to get latest rebuild status.



TROUBLESHOOTING

If dashboards are not getting populated:
Check ""illumio_get_index"" macro is updated if, you are using the custom index.
Check if the data model is accelerated or not.
Make sure you have data in given time range.
To check data is collected or not, run "" illumio_get_index | stats count by sourcetype"" query in the search.
Try expanding TimeRange.
Try ""<instance_url>/<language>/_bump"" endpoint to clear cache and load new static content.


If sankey diagram is not visualize in Traffic Explorer dashboard's ""Communications Map between Labeled Workloads"" panel:
Be aware that you will need to install the Sankey Diagram App from https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3112/


If the user wants to summarize port scan data to some custom index then update the ""illumio_portscan_index"" macro as mentioned below:
index = <your_index>


If label filters (i.e. app, env and loc) are not populated:
Try to run the ""Illumio_Workload_Mapping"" saved search via expanding timerange.
Make sure that interval configuration for input is less than 24 hours.



UNINSTALL APP
To uninstall an app, user can follow below steps: SSH to the Splunk instance -> Go to folder apps ($SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps) -> Remove the IllumioAppforSplunk folder from apps directory -> Restart Splunk

background details
While PORA is the companion app for Playbooks-On-Rails for Splunk (PORS) it can be used for ""just"" Ansible visualization as well (i.e. without PORS).
PORS is a collection of Ansible playbooks, roles & tasks for installing, configuring & managing your whole Splunk infrastructure - including Apps using the Splunk deployment process. But the icing on the cake is that PORS comes with a terminal UI that does all this with the snap of a finger!
PORA details
Features:

useful insights of (any) Ansible playbook runs (executed manually or by PORS)
alerting for failed Ansible playbook runs (predefined)
alerting for anything else you want - related to Ansible playbooks ;)
visualize any Ansible playbook run - even when just using Ansible without PORS

uberAgent consists of two main components: the actual agent runs on the endpoints you want to be monitored, sending the data it collects to the configured backend either directly or via Splunk's Universal Forwarder. The second main component, implemented as a set of Splunk apps, provides dashboards, visualizations, searches, and reports.
The Agent
uberAgent's data collecting component is a lightweight agent that runs independently of any runtimes or frameworks. The agent's footprint is so small that it is truly unobtrusive on the monitored endpoints and does not affect user density.
Where other products rely on operating system sources such as performance counters, WMI, or similar unfiltered data, uberAgent comes with its own metrics. Instead of raw data uberAgent gives you information that matters (see uberAgent's list of metrics).
The agent is highly configurable: metrics can be turned on or off individually, the data collection frequency can be chosen freely, blacklists and whitelists (supporting regular expressions) allow for fine-grained control. This ensures that only data you really need is sent to the backend for indexing.
Browser Extensions
uberAgent's endpoint agent is complemented by browser extensions, which enable uberAgent to collect performance and usage metrics from web apps, too. Extensions are available for all major browsers.
The Splunk Apps
Multiple Splunk apps help process and visualize the data collected by the agent. The indexer app lives on Splunk indexers and mainly creates uberAgent's index and data input. Dashboard apps implement the user interface, providing different views into the collected data. uberAgent comes with two dashboard apps: one for uberAgent UXM and another for uberAgent ESA.
uberAgent's main apps are complemented by special-purpose apps that offer a different view of the existing uberAgent data, such as the uberAgent Helpdesk app.
Most dashboards are searchable and have extensive filtering capabilities to give you a fast and powerful way of isolating specific data. Time range pickers make it easy to go back to the exact time a problem occurred.
uberAgent makes full use of Splunk's advanced UI components to display a beautiful user interface that fluidly adapts to screen width and device type. As a result, it works equally well on a tablet as on a PC or Mac.

 About Ordr SCE 
Ordr SCE is an IoT and unmanaged device security platform that discovers every connected device, profiles device behavior and risks, and automates security responses. Ordr not only identifies devices with vulnerabilities, weak passwords, expiring certificates, and active threats, but also those that exhibit malicious or suspicious behaviors. Finally, Ordr automates response for security and networking teams, such as dynamically generating policies and enforcing them on existing infrastructure, or alerting and triggering a specific security or operational workflow. 
Through an agentless deployment, within just a few hours of installation – via a network tap or SPAN – Ordr passively discovers every network-connected device with detailed context: manufacturer, model, device type, network connectivity information, and more. Ordr then enriches this device context with threat intelligence, vulnerability data, and FDA/device manufacturer alerts, and incorporates it into the Ordr Data Lake for analytics, reporting, and granular classifications for every device. 
Organizations can use Ordr’s rich device context and associated alarms to initiate specific workflow actions based on device type, group, manufacturer, model name and number, and more.
 Overview of Ordr Sce App 
The Ordr Splunk App v1.0.1 provides the ability to accurately identify devices, obtain a real-time asset inventory, alert on anomalous or malicious behavior, and enrich Splunk Enterprise for further analysis.

FAQ
Q: When I launch a container the first time, I cannot access Jupyter Lab.
A: The selected container image will be downloaded from dockerhub automatically in the background when you launch a container for the first time. Depending on your network this can take a while to download the docker image for the first time as the image sizes range from 2-12 GB. Please allow for some time to get the images initially pulled from Dockerhub. You can check which docker images are available locally by running docker images on your CLI.
Q: When I run DLTK 3.5 locally my browser showes insecure connection.
A: From DLTK 3.5 onwards the container images use HTTPS by default with self signed certificates for the data transfer related api endpoints and Jupyter Lab. Many browsers show ""insecure connection"" warnings and some allow to suppress that for localhost connections used during development. For production use, please work with your administrators to secure your setup and build containers with your own certificates as needed or use more advanced container environment setups.
Q: The example dashboards show no results or throw errors.
A: First, ensure that the right container image is downloaded and up and running for the specific example (e.g. TensorFlow examples require a TensorFlow container). Secondly, ensure that you have verified the associated notebook code exists in Juypter Lab and you have explicitly saved the notebook again (hit save button). By doing this, a python module is saved automatically generated (located in the /app/model folder in Juypter) which is needed to run the examples and populate the dashboards. Lastly, please check if MLTK's app permissions are set to global so that DLTK can use the lookup files used in most of the examples.
Q: Containers suddenly get stopped in about 1 minute after start.
A: Most likely you have two or more DLTK apps installed and configured to use the same container environment. In DLTK 3.x versions there is a scheduled search (MLTK Container Sync) that ensures synchronization of running containers and associated models for the DLTK app. If more than one DLTK app is running, this can cause synchronization collisions and therefore containers get stopped. When using DLTK 3.x please connect each DLTK app in a 1:1 relationship with your Docker and/or Kubernetes environment.
Q: Where are my notebooks stored in the docker environment?
A: By default, there are 2 docker volumes automatically mounted for persistance in your docker environment. Those volumes are named ""mltk-container-app"" and ""mltk-container-notebooks"". You can verify by running docker volume ls on your CLI. Important note: from DLTK version 3.1 onwards there is a new default volume called ""mltk-container-data"" - see migration notes below.
Q: What is the password for Jupyter Lab?
A: Please have a look at the Model Development Guide page in the Deep Learning Toolkit app.
Notebooks Migration note for change to 3.1 and later versions
Due to the addition of Kubernetes there was a change and addition made to the way how volumes behave. From 3.1 on and with the use of the golden image the container directory /srv is the default and notebooks and app code is in there. In earlier versions there were two docker volumes mounted into /srv/app and /srv/notebooks which will be mapped into a backup folder in Jupyter from version 3.1 on. For migration simply copy your notebooks from the backup folder back into the notebooks and app folder in case those are empty.",Version 3.7.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/6f2fbb64-3db6-11ec-9361-324b50038860.png,"Business Analytics, Utilities",https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-software-license-agreement.html,"3,928",0,splunk,5,5,Splunk Works,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/splunklabs,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

TIME_PREFIX = ""updated_timestamp"": ""
KV_MODE = json
Configuring Input(s)
The inputs should be configured only on heavy-forwarders or Splunk Enterprise standalone instance. There are 3 REST APIs that are used:
- /oauth2/token
- /spotlight/queries/vulnerabilities/v1
- /spotlight/entities/vulnerabilities/v2
INFO: In order to authenticate successfully, the add-on needs to use authentication header with each API call. The authentication header provides a token, which originally should be obtained by calling the Logon service via username and password. 
Successfully issued API token is valid for 27 min. In the add-on there is a timer which helps obtain a new token on every 1300 seconds or (~21-22 minutes).

The BotRx Protx for Splunk is to help BotRx ProTx customers to integrate their ProTx appliances into the Splunk system. It provides two source types for customers to choose based on their deployment needs, as well as a dashboard to show threat events detected by ProTx.
Supported Splunk Versions
7.0.0 and above
Platform requirement
Platform Independent
Source types
This app contains predefined source types that Splunk Enterprise uses to ingest incoming events and categorize these events for search.
The source types are based on the data sources that the app ingests. 
Many of the source types support data models in the Common Information Model.
Source type | Collection method  |
--- | --- |
botrx:protx:syslog | UDP/TCP/file over syslog protocol
botrx:protx:json | HTTP/HTTPS/file without syslog header
Installation
This app should be installed on the indexers and search heads.
Configuration

Configure your BotRx ProTx servers to send data to the syslog server or the Splunk indexer.
Follow the steps based on where the ProTx servers send data to the Splunk system: 
If the ProTx servers send data to the Splunk indexer directly, please configure the TCP/UDP inputs and set botrx:protx:syslog as the source type.
If the ProTx servers send data to syslog server and Unviersal Forwarder into the Splunk system, please follow below steps:
a.Configure the syslog server to filter by PROGRAM, store the MSG into the file.
b. Configure the UF to monitor the file, set botrx:protx:json as the source type.
If the ProTx servers send data to syslog server and HEC into the Splunk system, please follow below steps:
a. Create HEC token on the Splunk.
b. Configure the syslog server to filter by PROGRAM, set botrx:protx:json as the source type, MSG as the event body, then send to the Splunk system.

Uptime Calculation: the Status History dashboard provides information about past failures and calculates the website's uptime percentage
Status Monitoring Dashboard: provides the response time for your monitored websites and provides a historical analysis of the site's responsiveness
Email Outage Alerting: get an emailed alert when your website is down (responds too slowly or is returning an error)
Change History Dashboard: provides information regarding when the monitored pages changed

Configuration
Initial setup
Once you install the app, it will ask you to set it up on the app configuration page. The setup only contains options related to configuring a proxy server. If no proxy server is used, you can just press save.
Creating an input
You will need to create an input to define the websites that you would like to monitor. You can setup a new input using Splunk's manager at Settings » Data Inputs » Website Availability Check. The input is straightforward. You can ignore the ""Configuration"" parameter unless you want to use different proxy servers for different inputs.
FAQs
See the links below for answers to frequently asked questions:
What kind of response time from my website should I expect?""
I configured an input but it isn't working, how do I debug it?
How do I use different proxies for different inputs?
How do I allow non-admins to make new website monitoring inputs?

Database import - Splunk DB Connect allows you to import tables, rows, and columns from a database directly into Splunk Enterprise, which indexes the data. You can then analyze and visualize that relational data from within Splunk Enterprise just as you would the rest of your Splunk Enterprise data.


Database export - DB Connect also enables you to output data from Splunk Enterprise back to your relational database. You map the Splunk Enterprise fields to the database tables you want to write to.


Database lookups - DB Connect also performs database lookups, which let you reference fields in an external database that match fields in your event data. Using these matches, you can add more meaningful information and searchable fields to enrich your event data.


 Database access - DB Connect also allows you to directly use SQL in your Splunk searches and dashboards. Using these commands, you can make useful mashups of structured data with machine data.

After installation you should be able to find Route Map application on main dashboard. 
Route Map application can work with real-time data as well as replay historic data depending on what you choose in the search control application.
In real-time mode you can only track locations of objects at the current time. The application also stores the routes of these objects for time window which you choose in the search controls:

If you choose a specific time range in past, like ""Last 15 minutes"", you can replay object movements on the map, also you can specify Speed and Graduality (how often you want to redraw points on map):

In case if firebase source does not provide any data - you can click on Show sample data link.

The Ixia NTO app for Splunk provides basic statistics reporting from the Net Tool Optimizer (NTO) by Ixia, The app relies of the NTO's WebApi feature that is available starting with the 3.9.0/4.1.0 releases of the NTO. 
Each configured NTO chassis is polled for statistics periodically through a scripted input. The
the received statistics are indexed into Splunk, and can be visualized from the reporting views. Statistics  for all types of ports (tool, network) and dynamic filters can be collected and visualized. Bidirectional ports are treated as both tool ports & network ones (and will provide both types of statistics)
1) Target Platform . The Ixia NTO app is intended to be used with Splunk 5.0.5.or newer.
2) System requirements. This app has been tested with Splunk running on Windows & Mac based operating systems. (other OS are possible, but not tested at this time)
3) Installation. Install the app using the Splunk platform; 
   Go to Manager -> Apps -> Install App from File
   - Browse for the ""anue_app.spl"" file
   - Click Upload 
   - The Splunk Framework detects that it needs to restarts itself
   - Click to Restart Splunk 
   After installation the app label is visible and can be run within the Splunk Platform ""App"" tab. 
4) Configuration.  The app starts with no settings configured. Use the in-app 
   ""Setup"" tab to add chassis. Input the desired NTO chassis ip address, along with
   the credentials necessary to access it and the WebApi port (leave the default tcp port 8000  ). Then for each added chassis the app allows the possibility to configure what tool/network/bidirectional ports and dynamic filter to poll . Use the ""Setup"" menu anytime you need to change the current poll configuration.
Note: Within the Splunk Manager->Data Inputs->Script  , do not change the properties 
   for the app's inputed script, that is ""...\anue.py""
5) Running the Ixia NTO app. After at least one port a dynamic filter has been configured for a NTO, the app periodically polls that NTOs and ask statistics for the configured entities . The received statistics are indexed within Splunk, and used to build  visualizations. The available views are grouped into three menu tabs. Tool Port Statistics, Network Port Statistics, Dynamic Filters Statistics. 
Tool Port Statistics menu contains views concerning tool ports only : ""Current Utilization"", ""Current Rate"", ""Current Drops"" and ""De-Duplication"". The ""De-Duplication"" view provides visualization only for Advanced Feature Module (AFM) type TOOL ports. 
Network Port Statistics menu contains views associated only with network ports: ""Pass Deny Rate"",""Current Rate"",""Current Utililization"", ""De-duplication"". Again the ""De-Duplication"" view provides visualization only for Advanced Feature Module (AFM) type NETWORK ports. 
The Dynamic Filters Statistics menu groups views related to dynamic filters : ""Current Rate in Bits"",""Current Rate in Packets"".
In each of the available views there is a UI dropdown that allows to select the available NTO from which to visualize statistics. Selecting an option from the mentioned dropdown generates an additional dropdown containing the configured entities for the selected NTO, if there are any available.  The time range can be selected using the Splunk build-in time range picker.
6) Feature list. Currently the following statistics are available for visualization:
    TOOL Ports : 
    - tp_current_tx_utilization (Current Utilization view)
    - tp_current_pass_percent_packets (Current Utilization view)  
    - tp_current_tx_rate_bits (Current Rate view)
    - tp_current_drop_rate_packets (Current Drops view)
    - tp_current_tx_rate_packets (Current Drops view)
    - tp_current_insp_rate_packets (Current Drops view)
    - tp_total_dedup_percent_packets (De-Duplication view)
NETWORK Ports :
- np_current_pass_rate_packets (Pass Deny Rate)
- np_current_deny_rate_packets (Pass Deny Rate)
- np_current_rx_rate_bits (Current Rate)
- np_current_rx_utilization (Current Utililization)
- np_total_dedup_percent_packets (Deduplication)

DYNAMIC FILTERS :
- df_current_pass_rate_bits 
- df_current_insp_rate_bits
- df_current_deny_rate_bits
- df_current_pass_rate_packets
- df_current_insp_rate_packets
- df_current_deny_rate_packets

7) Troubleshooting. If the Ixia NTO app does not behave as expected, check the app logs
   for indication of encountered problem. These are located at :
   -[SPLUNK_HOME]\var\log\splunk\""Anue-nto_ip_address"".log  for each NTO
   -[SPLUNK_HOME]\var\log\splunk\AnueController.log 
   -[SPLUNK_HOME]\var\log\splunk\AnueChassisSelector.log
   -[SPLUNK_HOME]\var\log\splunk\AnueIdSelector.log
   -[SPLUNK_HOME]\var\log\splunk\AnueConfigParser.log

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3766,2022-01-10,07:43:54 AM,Archived Intrusion App for Splunk,,"Sept. 4, 2019","Intrusion App for Splunk
Deprecation Warning!!!
This app has been deprecated. There will be no new development or bug fixes. It has been replaced by the Aplura Intrusion App for Splunk.
Overview
Many organizations is IDS/IPS devices and software as their first line of defense against attackers. This app provides Splunk dashboards, forms, and reports which can be used to explore your IDS events across your different sourcetypes.
To do this, the app relies on the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) for IDS attack events. This means that the app can report on any authentication data, as long as it has been on-boarded properly, and is available through the Intrusion Detection data model, including network, host, wireless, and application products.
A note on Splunk Data Model Acceleration and Disk Space
This app requires data model acceleration, which will use additional disk space. If you are using the Splunk App for Enterprise Security, this is already enabled, and should have been factored into your retention policies. If not, you should review the documentation on data model acceleration, how it uses disk space, and how to plan for it.
A note on the Splunk Common Information Model
As mentioned above, the app uses the CIM for authentication events. The CIM allows you to take events from a number of sources or products, and report on them in one cohesive manner, using a common set of names for fields and event types.
Available Dashboards
Intrusion Overview
Provides a starting point for exploring your IDS events. Most panels will drill-down to other pages in the application.
Attack Source Profile
A view based on the source of IDS events.
Attack Destination Profile
IDS events where attacks are launched against the same destination.
Attack Signature Profile
Panels which focus on events which all are from the same identified with the same signature.
Attack Category Profile
A view focusing on attacks which fall into the same category (as defined in the events).
Attack Search
A form for finding events based on various field values.
Sourcetypes (Advanced)
Information about the sourcetypes which are present in the accelerated data.
Prerequisites
Splunk Versions
This app has been tested with Splunk versions 6.6. This app should be installed on the same search head on which the Authentication data model has been accelerated.
Splunk Common Information Model Add-on
This app depends on data models included in the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on, specifically the ""Authentication"" data model. Please review the information on installing and using the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on and information on configuring the acceleration on the data model.
The Splunk Common Information Model Add-on can be downloaded from Splunkbase.
This app has been tested with versions 4.9 of the CIM add-on. 
Data model Acceleration on the Intrusion data model
In order to make the app respond and load quickly, accelerated data models are used to provide summary data. For this data to be available, the Intrusion Detection data model must be accelerated. Information on how to enable acceleration for the Intrusion Detection data model can be found here. The data model must be accelerated for the length of time for which you would like to see reporting.
Installation
This app should be installed on a search head where the Intrusion Detection data model has been accelerated. More information on installing or upgrading Splunk apps can be found here.
Simple Installation Process

Make sure the field extractions and tags on your authentication events are correct.
Install the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on (skip if you are installing on an ES search head).
Install the Intrusion App for Splunk.
Enable accelerations on the Intrusion Detection data model (skip if you are installing on an ES search head).
Wait for the accelerations to start. After the acceleration searches have run, you should start seeing the dashboards populate.

About support for this app
Support for this app is provided on a best-effort basis. We have released this app for free, and want to help solve issues, and add features, but we also have day-jobs. The Github repo to report issues can be found here.

The correlated alerts and root cause information can be used to automatically populate ServiceNow incidents.
The Cisco ThousandEyes Alerting App for Splunk app contains four lookup files that are customer specific. These lookup files allow you to group alerts together and apply different weighting to each ThousandEyes test rule in order to identify the root cause of the issue that has triggered the alerts. SNMP traps can also be grouped together and weighting applied to identify the root cause of the issue based on the SNMP trap. Using the same group name for ThousandEyes alerts and SNMP traps allows them to be correlated, and the root cause determined by both the ThousandEyes alerts and SNMP traps (based on weighting).
The app also supports creating ServiceNow incidents and populating them with correlated alerts and SNMP traps, as well as the root cause (that is determined by the entries made to the lookup files). If ServiceNow integration is required, then the Splunk Add-on for ServiceNow must also be installed and configured.
Post installation documentation and guidelines on configuring the lookup files to define the groupings for ThousandEyes alerts and SNMP traps are available from the author.
Contact the author: splunkapp@ecs.co.uk 
Topology and Setting up Splunk Environment
1) Install the main app (Cisco ThousandEyes Alerting App for Splunk).
2) Create the following indexes:
    thousandeyes
    thousandeyes_alert_status
    thousandeyes_alertid_lookup
    thousandeyes_incident_values_lookup
    snmptrap
    snmptrap_status
3) Configure a HTTP Event Collector (HEC) token on your Forwarder:
    index: thousandeyes
    sourcetype: thousandeyes:alerts
4) Configure the ThousandEyes console to send the ThousandEyes alerts to your Forwarder using the HEC token you created in Step 3. Verify that alerts are being received using the search: index=thousandeyes sourcetype=thousandeyes:alerts
5) Optional: Configure a SNMP trap receiver with a Splunk Universal Forwarder and forward the SNMP traps. Verify that the SNMP traps are being received using the search: index=snmptrap sourcetype=snmptrap
6) Optional: Install the Splunk Add-on for ServiceNow
             Configure a ServiceNow user in Splunk called thousandeyes
             Enable the incidents input (frequency: 30 seconds)
7) Configure the lookup files to map the ThousandEyes testIds to user defined test groups and to apply weighting and root cause information to ThousandEyes ruleIds.
8) Optional: Configure the SNMP trap lookup files to map source/destination IP addresses to test groups and to apply weighting and root cause information.
More details are available in the post-installation configuration documentation and test configuration guidelines available from the author.

Splunk SPL Replay version 1.1.2
Copyright (C) 2005-2018 Splunk Inc. All Rights Reserved.

In conjunction with Splunk's SplunkZero Team (www.splunk.com), and Aplura, LLC (www.aplura.com), we are pleased to show you the replay custom command.
replay is designed to execute adhoc or scheduled searches based on results in SPL. The SA was designed to execute searches only to perform load testing/repeatable searches on a Search Head. This command WILL NOT return events back into the main search.
Usage
The replay command takes several optional parameters. Defaults are listed in the table below. Three fields are required for the command to work correctly. earliest, latest, and search. These can be named anything (as long as the option is set), but these are the defaults. Earliest and latest are ""Splunk Time Modifier"" compatibile fields. You can use ""-2d@d"" or unix seconds in those fields. search contains the search to execute and must contain a generating command. 
This command will not return events back to the main search, so if you need those results, you must use data summerization techniques (think summary indexing) or the like. This command schedules and dispatches separate threads for each search using the Splunk REST endpoints. This allows the main search to finish while allowing the main Splunk scheduler the ability to execute the search based on resources. 
SHC Compatibility
The replay command offers both non-SHC and SHC support. If you wish to use the SHC feature, set the corresponding flag (shc_lb) according to the table below. IMPORTANT: In order to use SHC Load balancing, you must have a common user stored in the Password Store. Use set_credential.sh to create the user credential in the store. The user must also exist on all SH in the cluster (the user must be created as a user AND be present in the store).
Modes
This command offers the ability to perform in two different modes. They are ad-hoc and scheduled.
Ad Hoc
Ad-hoc mode allows a splunk user to ingest a CSV or result set of searches and dispatch them immediately. This is useful when immediate load testing is desired, with no regard for the timing of the searches. This mode is easiest to use, and requires the least amount of fields. See Example 1 below.
Scheduled
Scheduled mode takes a specific set of fields, and schedules the searches. While in this mode, the main search (the one that is executed to run replay) will set itself into a ""PAUSED"" state. While in this state, it will continue to monitor and dispatch searches according to the schedules set. If you desire to end the main search, simply unpause it, and it will finalize automatically. This mechanism is required to maintain the schedules of to-be-executed searches, as well as to allow it to not become an orphan in the event of a restart, or other action, that kills the parent search. See example 2 below.
The field schedule_time is required for scheduled searches. This field contains a timestamp to use for scheduled exection. The DATE of the timestamp does not matter, but the TIME does. IF the timestamp is in the future, that's ok, the TIME will be used (%H:%M:%S). The scheduler supports seconds-level granularity. The default is to poll and execute searches every 10 seconds.
Search Command Defaults



Option
Default
Type
Description




earliest
earliest
field name
The field that contains the earliest time modifier. Can use Splunk Notation (""-1d@d"") or Unix Epoch time.


latest
latest
field name
The field that contains the latest time modifier. Can use Splunk Notation (""-1d@d"") or Unix Epoch time.


search
search
field name
The field that contains the search string to execute. Must begin with a generating command.


schedule
false
boolean
A true value needs schedule_time to be in the results. This tells the command to schedule search execution according to time.


schedule_time
schedule_time
field name
This is the field that contains the time was executed. Date is not important, but the TIME is important. This is in Unix Epoch time only.


time_diff
86400
integer
This is the offset at which to schedule the search. This is in seconds. Defaults to 1 day.


timer
10
integer
This controls the polling of the scheduler in seconds. Allows for batch scheduling (every 10 seconds for example)


show_data
false
boolean
This shows detailed output from the REST commands used to execute the searches.


shc_lb
false
boolean
This allows you to use all UP members of a SHC to execute searches.


shc_lb_user
None
string
This specifies the user to use when dispatching to SHC members. MUST EXIST ON ALL MEMBERS AND HAVE THE PASSWORD STORED IN THE CREDENTIAL STORE ON EACH MEMBER



Examples

| makeresults | eval search=""search index=_internal | stats count by host"", earliest=""-1h@h"", latest=""now"" | replay
This creates the three required fields, and then executes the search.   


| makeresults | eval search=""search index=_internal | stats count by host"", earliest=""-1h@h"", latest=""now"", schedule_time = now() + 30 | replay schedule=true
This creates a scheduled search. It is scheduled for ""now + 30s"". 



Support Offered
Support for this is community based, not commercial. Use the email address listed for further information.
You can start by generating a DIAG, using the command $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk diag --collect=app:spl_replay. This can then be sent to whomever is supporting the app. Most likely the community. 
You can also search index=_internal sourcetype=replay and find detailed information. Turn on DEBUG logging to see even more diagnostic information.

Installation and Initial Setup
Technical Note
app.conf overview: $SPLUNK_HOME/Splunk/etc/apps/search_cp/local/app.conf
Upon initial setup, the parameter is configured located under the stanza install must have a value of 0. This value represents that the application is indeed starting up for the first time and is not configured for use. A user's first use of the Catchpoint Splunk Modular Input should, by default, take the user to the App configuration page when the is configured is 0.

From the home view of SplunkWeb, navigate to the left-hand side and select the grayed Find More Apps icon. In the search bar that appears, search for Catchpoint Search and select Install. Upon completion, select  Restart. Once restarted, from the home view, select the Catchpoint Search app found on the left-hand side of the view. On the App configuration page which follows, select Continue to app page setup to continue.
On the setup page, the base URL (Catchpoint API URL) has been automatically set.
Complete the setup by supplying the consumer key and consumer secret within the remaining fields.
Multiple client/division support for performance and alerts data:
1. To pull data from multiple client/division, Navigate to Manage Apps page.
1. Search for Catchpoint Search and select Set up from Actions.
1. Complete the setup by supplying the consumer key and consumer secret within the remaining fields.

Manual Installation
If manually installing the application from its tarball form, it is important to ensure (when the .tar has been expanded) that the base directory's name of the application is search_cp.
The end result of a manual installation should reflect the following folder structure -- where search_cp is the name of the application directory.
~SPLUNK_HOME
\etc

..\apps

..\..\search_cp


Getting Data In
Navigate to Settings > Data inputs and locate Catchpoint Modular Input. On the right-hand side of the located row, select Add New. To begin ingesting Catchpoint data within Splunk, supply the required values for Catchpoint Input Name, Test ID and Client Secret, Catchpoint Input Name is used only for labeling the tests json. Client Secret should match one of the consumer secret key which was supplied in the set up page.
It should be noted that the user should pay special attention to the required format of the Test ID field.
The modular input can be setup with just one test ID, however, if the user chooses to create the modular input with multiple test IDs,
it is required multiple test IDs

be of a comma-seperated values form.
be of the same test type.

Example.
Assume the following Test IDs to be of the same type:

XXX
YYY
ZZZ

Assume the following Test ID to be of a different type of the IDs mentioned above:

BBB

As an example,
https://io.catchpoint.com/v{version}/performance/raw?tests=XXX,YYY,ZZZ
is a VALID endpoint because

the Test IDs provided are of a comma-seperated values form.
the Test IDs provided are of the same test type.

As a closing example,
    https://io.catchpoint.com/v{version}/performance/raw?tests=XXX,BBB,YYY
is an INVALID endpoint because although

the Test IDs provided are of a comma-seperated values form,
the Test IDs provided are NOT of the same test type.

Options
Under More settings, the user is able to set the Index and Host field values.
The Index dropdown sets the destination index for this source. It is recommended users choose catchpoint as the specified index. To finish input setup, select Next toward the top of the page's view.
Closing Note
The frequency or 'interval' of how often the newly created data input is executed has been programmatically determined by using the start and end time values of the initial event json recently indexed into Splunk.

Viewing the Data Within Splunk
Upon completing the Getting Data In section, the user is now ready to view thier data being ingested within Splunk. From Splunk's homepage, select the Catchpoint Search app icon found on the left-hand side.
The user is able to complete searches within the Catchpoint index with the command index = catchpoint.",Version 1.0.2,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/5cc9e5f0-acc3-11eb-9447-06382f3616cf.png,Business Analytics,https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,"1,034",0,splunk,3,9,Catchpoint Systems,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/rpellette,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

Quantify adds a 'range' field to each event that denotes which categories the event falls into. The 'range' field is a space-delimited list that can be piped into makemv to create a multivalued field (i.e. | makemv range) when needed.
** TODO: Floating point support will be added to a future release.
Syntax:
quantify (max=<int> | maxfield=<field>)+ (min=<int> | minfield=<field>)+ [overlap=high|low] [label=high|low|mid|range] bins=<int> field=<field>
'bins' - how many categories to create.
'field' - which field contains the values to 
'min' - the floor to use when calculating categories. (Only valid when 'minfield' is not specified.)
'max' - the ceiling to use when calculating categories. (Only valid when 'maxfield' is not specified.)
'maxfield' - the name of the field that contains the cieling to use for categories.
'minfield' - the name of the field that contains the floor to use for categories.
'overlap' - cause categories to all begin or end on the same value, allowing events to fall into multiple categories.
overlap=low - all categories will begin with the same floor ('min' or the value of 'minfield' by default).
overlap=high - all categories will end with the same ceiling ('max' or the value of 'maxfield' by default).
'label' - determines how to label the categories:
high - uses the highest value of category for its label.
low - uses the lowest value of a category for its label.
mid - uses the median value of a category for its label.
range - names the category according to its range, like the rangemap command (i.e. 'low-high'). This is the default.
NOTE: 'Quantify' attempts to split all categories, equally; however, if category sizes cannot be divided, equally, 'Quantify' will stretch the highest-value category.
Examples:
index=_internal | head 100 | streamstats count AS c | eventstats max(c) AS max_c min(c) AS min_c | quantify label=range maxfield=max_c bins=4 field=c | stats count by range
This will split the data into four categories, each category representing an equal division based on the ceiling provided by the 'total' field. This search creates (0-24, 25-49, 50-74, 75-100)
index=_internal | head 100 | streamstats count AS c | eventstats max(c) AS max_c min(c) AS min_c | quantify overlap=low label=range minfield=min_c maxfield=max_c bins=4 field=c | stats count by range
This will split the data into four overlapping categories, each category representing an equal division based on the ceiling provided by the 'total' field. This search creates (1-25, 1-50, 1-75, 1-100)
index=_internal | head 100 | streamstats count AS c | quantify label=low max=50 min=1 bins=2 field=c | stats count by range
This will create two dynamic categories (1-25 labeled '1' , 26-50 labeled '26'). Events whose c value are outside this range will be quantified as OTHER.",Version 1.4,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/6acac28c-6900-11e3-b4de-005056ad5c72.png,Utilities,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,405,0,splunk,0,0,Ron Naken,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/rnaken,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

... | base64 field=your_field [action=(encode|decode)] [mode=(replace|append)] [suppress_error=(True|False)]

field : field to encode or decode.
action : encode (default) or decode the content. Optional.
mode : replace the existing field content (default) or create a new field named base64 (mode append). Optional.
suppress_error : do not raise errors if set to True. Optional, default to False.

Note on decoding:
While the input string can be anything for the encoding operation, it should respect the  alphabet [a-zA-Z0-9/=] and its length should be a multiple of 4 while decoding. If the format is not respected, the command will throw errors (except if you set the flag suppress_error). 
In the following example, we assume we are working on proxy/web logs and those will contains a field uri. This field will contains URI links and some of them will contains
an argument plop which refer to Base64 encoded data.
So, to get it working:

filter the results
extract the base64 content (command rex)
evaluate the length of the base64 content to avoid content with a wrong padding
decode the base64 content

Here is one way of doing it in Splunk:
... your search to get field 'uri' for example...
| fields uri
| rex field=uri ""plop=(?<content_to_decode>[a-zA-Z0-9/=]*)”
| eval clength=len(content_to_decode)%4
| search clength=0

Description:
First of all 99% of the credit goes to Steve Zhang for creating the actual python script sendjobmeta.py. I've just packaged the app for download and use.
This app will allow you to send search job performance and metadata results to another Splunk instance over TCP.
Install Instructions:
Untar send_job_meta.spl into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ or install app through GUI.
Use:
""... | sendjobmeta ip=ip_address port=port_number""
Where ip_address is the ip address of your receiving Splunk instance and port_number is the port this instance is listening for TCP on. Default Values are ip=127.0.0.1 and port=7090 if you just use ""| sendjobmeta"".
If you want to change the defaults you can edit sendjobmeta.py in the /send_job_meta/bin directory.
*Note: Make sure the receiving instance is 1) set to be a receiver AND 2) you have set up a data input for listening over TCP on port 7090 (default) or a port of your choice.
Example:
index=_internal | stats count | sendjobmeta
OR
index=_internal | stats count | sendjobmeta ip=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx port=xxxx",Version 1.2,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/image/default_icon.png,Utilities,https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,395,0,splunk,0,0,Stephen Luedtke,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/sluedtke_splunk,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

Create an index to use on Indexer(s) (for storage) and the Forwarder (for index selection).
Install the add-on to a Splunk Enterprise Standalone instance or a Splunk Enterprise Forwarder.
Go to the add-on.
Go to the configuration page.
Create a new account.
Enter a unique name for your new account and then for the password enter a Palo Alto Networks API token for the user you have created to read data from the PAN device(s) and save.
Go to the Inputs page.
Create a new input for each host you wish to pull data from. I recommend two per host. 1 for the configuration file, and 1 for anything else you want data wise this way I can poll for most data every 60 seconds, and 3600 seconds for the config xml.
host should be what you want to your devices to show up as in charts and reports, index should be the index you created in the beginning, the api account should be the account you want to use to connect to the device, and the api url should be https://pandevice.domain.tld/api or https://panipaddress/api.
If the data doesn't parse correctly or line break, put the props file or the add-on on your Indexer(s).
Install the PAN XML API app to get some nice visualizations of your PAN data (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3733/).
Planning to update with additional data input options. Please let me know if you have any suggestions. I know a few of the sourcetypes I pull, the data could be cleaner, so I will work towards different api quieres to get at the data. This was just an attempt to get some data out of PAN, so you could monitor it without logging into multiple devices or having access to a Panorama device.

But many organizations are still flying blind, with no easy way to derive operational intelligence from the vast amounts of machine data generated by these critical systems.
It’s time for data streams from the mainframe to be as accessible as your other data streams when it comes to analytics for business intelligence and security monitoring.
Ironstream enables you to collect and forward mainframe log data, including security data, into Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security and Splunk IT Service Intelligence where you can get that true 360-degree view.
Users can then easily search, analyze, and visualize the data for powerful business intelligence reporting -- without needing specialized expertise and different monitoring systems for mainframe.
Make more sense of the valuable machine data hidden away on your mainframe.

When it sits on a corporate network, it functions similar to servers and desktops. Therefore they are equally vulnerable to cyber-attack like those that target at servers and desktops. However, many security solutions focus more on servers and desktops. Printers and MFPs are often neglected or not sufficiently protected.

Nifi Monitor Overview: This panel allows you to analyze in a general view all the NIFI instances configured in the application, quickly accessing key data such as status, active threads, queued data, running, stopped, invalid and disabled components among others. It will also allow you to know the disk space per repository and also a detailed report of the errors and problems detected.
The overview panel is complemented by other panels that include much more detailed information about the processes.

Configuration
This application requieres enabling a HTTP Event Collector (HEC) data input to receive the information from NIFI.
There are two ways of configuration that allow the sending of events to Splunk and their choice depends on the authentication mechanisms that NIFI has enabled.
**Use a Data Input NIFI
The configuration of NIFI and Splunk allow to establish two types of sending and receiving information.
Direct sending: This configuration will establish NIFI as the main way to send data to Splunk and should be used when NIFI does not have authentication methods enabled.
Data Input NIFI: Splunk will be in charge of making requests to the NIFI instances to retrieve the information from the Monitoring API by enabling and using the Data Input NIFI. This configuration should be used when NIFI has basic authentication.

- Splunk 6.5.x (Not tested but it should run on previous versions.)
- Huawei router E5186
Description:
The app is using a Python script to collect data through the router's REST API.
Configuration:
You have to provide your router's homepage URL in the file $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/huaweilte/bin/huaweilte.conf
The file already contains the default URL, i.e. http://192.168.8.1/
Usage:
The app adds one index (huaweilte) and 3 script inputs running every 10 seconds.
It collects status, signal and traffic data.
Dashboards:
There are 3 dashboards:
- LTE signal: provides information about the signal strength which may help you to find the best location for the router or the antennas.
- Traffic: provides information about the downloaded data volume
- Status: indicates the router's uptime

A Splunk® add-on providing a custom search command haveibeenpwned to query Troy Hunt's haveibeenpwned API (https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v3/) for known breaches of your (company's) domains or your friends'/family's/enemies'/hardly distantly related someone's/employees'/colleagues' mail adresses.
Please respect people's privacy and adhere to the service's acceptable use (https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#AcceptableUse). I tried respecting the limits posed on the API's use in the command's source code, which is why you'll have to have a little patience when querying for large amounts of mail addresses.
I was unsatisfied with the publicly available Splunk add-ons already providing this functionality as they either didn't allow control over what and how is queried for or didn't format the output to my wishes. So I came up with my own Splunk add-on implementing these missing features.
Cross-compatible with Python 2 and 3. Tested on Splunk Enterprise 8.2.3 and 8.1.1 on Windows, Linux and Splunk Cloud.
Licensed under http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.
Feel free to submit issues via https://github.com/hRun/SA-haveibeenpwned/issues.
Installation & Updating
Just unpack to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps on your Splunk search head and restart the instance. Use the deployer in a distributed environment.
Important note on updating to add-on version 2.x.x: 
When updating from add-on version 1.x.x to 2.x.x, you'll be required to reconfigure used API key and proxies (see Requirements & Setup). Un-privileged users without the list_storage_passwords capability will no longer be able to make use of mode=mail. A custom role can_query_hibp is supplied to empower such users (including all negative implications this capability brings with it until Splunk finally decides to fix it).
For legacy Splunk environments, if you prefer a slimmer implementation or if the stated capability limitations are not an option, please use add-on version 1.2.3. Overall functionality is exactly the same. 
Set python.version=python2 or python.version=python3 in commands.conf if you would like to explicitly specify the Python version to use. Otherwise this will be determined by your instance's global settings. Set python.version=python2 in restmap.conf if you experience issues with the app's configuration page on older Splunk instances.
Requirements & Setup
Your Splunk instance requires acess to the internet (via a proxy) to query https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v3/*. Configure proxies via the app's configuration page if required.
Unfortunately parts of the HIBP API now require an API key which you can obtain here: https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/Key. Specify your API key via the app's configuration page to be able to use mode=mail. mode=domain will work without an API key.
Usage
Use as a search command like so:
search index=example | table email | haveibeenpwned [mode=<mail|domain>] [threshold=<days>] [pastes=<all|dated|none>] <field-list>
mode: Control whether to query for breaches regarding one or multiple domains or specific mail addresses. Default: mail.
threshold: Set how many days to look back for breaches. Default: 7 days.
pastes: Control whether to additionally query for account pastes or not or only those with a timestamp when using mode=mail. Default: dated.
Expect the search to take ~ 2 seconds per mail address when using mode=mail due to the API's acceptable use. Do not attempt to spam the search as it will only degrade the performance further.

Custom Visualizations give you new interactive ways to visualize your data during search and investigation, and to better communicate results in dashboards and reports. After installing this app youll find a MITRE ATT&CK Heatmap diagram as an additional item in the visualization picker in Search and Dashboard.
This app uses Enterprise ATT&CK v9. For more information visit https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/
For further documentation visit https://github.com/alatif113/mitre_attck_heatmap
Usage
Search Query
| table <att&ck_technique_id> <numerical_value> [description]
OR
| stats <aggregation> by <att&ck_technique_id>
The visualization requires at least 2 fields to be present within the search output, with an optional third:
1. att&ck_technique_id: The ID of a MITRE ATT&CK Technique (e.g. T0001)
2. numerical_value / aggregation: A numerical value or aggregation to associate with the technique (e.g. count, sum, average)
3. (Optional) descroption: An optional description to associate with the technique, to display within a tooltop on mouse hover.  
Note: The visualization has been developed for dark mode. Light mode will be supported in a future version.

... | objectpath ""$""
ObjectPath is like paths to files in your operating system. . means we want to go one level deeper in JSON document (equivalent to / on Unix/Mac or \ on Windows in the paths to files).
... | objectpath ""$.store.book""
This returns an array. You can select a specific element from it, filter etc:
... | objectpath ""$.store.book[1]"" # get the second book""
... | objectpath ""$.store.book[-1]"" # get the last book""
... | objectpath ""$.store.book[2:4]"" # get the 3rd and 4th book""
We can also get specific elements based on their properties:
... | objectpath ""$.store.book[@.price is 0.99]"" # get books of price 0.99
@ points to the current element from books. In other words, [ iterates over the array of books and for each element checks if condition inside square parenthesis is met. @ tells ObjectPath that price is an property of each book, not a string.
To make it even more interesting we can filter it even further by getting only the specific fields from results:
... | objectpath ""$.store.book[@.price is 0.99].(price, isbn)"" # WARNING! works only in Python verion! filter attributes from the result
When we don't know where in the document are prices, we can search for all of them by:
... | objectpath ""$..price"" # searches for any attribute named price in the document
... | objectpath ""$..price[@ > 0.99]"" # returns all prices greater than 0.99

Known issue:
Certain features of this Corvil App (e.g. Export PCAP) require the App to have authorized remote access to the API on the Corvil appliance(s). This authorized remote API access via the Corvil App uses the Corvil user credentials that are stored as part of the Corvil Connector’s data input within Splunk. 
If a Splunk user with administrator-level rights configured the Corvil Connector data input and chose to encrypt the stored Corvil user’s password, then other non-administrator Splunk users that use the Corvil App will not be able to use those features that require authorized remote access (e.g. Export PCAP). To ensure non-administrator Splunk users can use these features, these Splunk users must be assigned the list_storage_passwords capability within Splunk (added in Splunk 6.5.0).",Version 1.1.2,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/92bcd9d0-ce07-11e8-bac9-02f13bdc2585.png,IT Operations,https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,367,0,splunk,5,2,Corvil Connectors,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/Corvil,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

Summary
USER GUIDE
Data types
This app provides the index-time and search-time knowledge for the following types of data from Cyphort:

cyphort:api
This data feed is the result of the calls to the Cyphort API. If you aren't receiving incidents check here for a possible explanation.


CyphortForSplunk:error
This data feed is the result of any errors presented during the consumption of Cyhport API data.


cyphort:incident
This data feed is the output of the Incidents pulled from the Cyphort API data stream.



Pre-Built Panels
Cyphort For Splunk uses pre-built panels on the Incident Overview dashboard. When cloning panels to new/existing dashboards make sure to use
the pre-built panels. Pre-built panels ensure that if a panel is removed and re-added to a dashboard (or if they are added to a new
dashboard) the panel will function as expected. As an example, panels on the incident overview drilldown to the incident detail dashboard.
Procedure to add existing panels to dashboards:

Select the Edit dropdown and choose Edit Panels from the menu.
Click the +Add Panel button.
Check under Add Prebuilt Panel to see if an appropriate panel already exists. If so, select this panel.
Create a new panel by clicking the Add to Dashboard button.
Click the Done button after the panel(s) have been added.

Current Version 1.0.4
New Features!

Added the ability to use a Custom API end point
Updated Computers API endpoint to exclude FONTS, to save data

Features
Using this integration you can:
  - Import Computer and Mobile Device data from multiple Jamf Pro instances
  - Import several system settings fields using the Custom API field
  - Create and expand on visuals using tools in Splunks ecosystem
Advanced Computer and Mobile Search
The Computers tab and Mobile Devices tabs use a specific Jamf Pro endpoint referred to as Advanced Computer Searches. The power of these is you can use the Criteria section to narrow your selection of devices. For an example you can collect on only managed devices so you don't collect on devices you no longer are responsible for. You can also control the data that goes into the Splunk engine by using the Display section. Only Data fields that are checked will be ingested by the Splunk Event Writer. This allows you to reduce your logging to only values you want or can remove what you deem Personally  Identifiable Information.
To use these highlight the Computer or Mobile Device tab and then in the Custom URL field enter the Name of the Advanced Search.
Learn more here: 
https://docs.jamf.com/10.16.0/jamf-pro/administrator-guide/Advanced_Computer_Searches.html
Custom API End points
Custom API endpoints allows you to collect information from the Jamf Pro by integrating directly with the API. Below is a list of common endpoints that you may want to collect against. Copy paste these code paths into the custom fields to get the data described or go to the Jamf API page found here:
Structure
The API endpoints work such that if you call any of the JSSResource endpoints if you call the base it will take call that and then iterate across all objects that return. As an example if you call /JSSResource/computers/ it will call all computers. If you enter a NAME or ID field in the custom URL it will only call that object directly. Example would be /JSSResource/computers/id/10 this would return only the computer with the JSS_ID equal to 10. If you use the name it will return the computer that last reported that has that system name. 
Interesting Custom API strings
/JSSResource/computers
This allows you to iterate across the computers and pull every computer. There is no restrictions and the only field that is dropped is the FONTS field.
/JSSResource/mobiledevices
This allows you to iterate across the mobile devices and pull every iPad, iPhone, appleTV, and other mobile devices. It returns all fields
/JSSResource/byoprofiles
This collects the configuration profiles that would be applied to computers or mobile devices that are user enrolled, formerally Bring Your Own Device profiles
/JSSResource/computerconfigurations
This collects all of the Computer Configurations that could be applied to a computer. It also returns details related to what is controlled by the configuration profile
/JSSResource/directorybindings
This collects the User Direcotry Bindings and authentication that devices use for user lookup. Used with conditional access systems
/JSSResource/licensedsoftware
This collects the software that you are licensed to use from the Apple Store. You must be connected with Apple School or Business Manager to use this feature
/JSSResource/macapplications
This collects every application that the Jamf Pro server has seen on devices since it has started collecting. This is a high data usage endpoint
/JSSResource/mobiledeviceapplications
This collects every application installed on a mobile device that the Jamf Pro server has seen. This is a high data usage endpoint
/JSSResource/restrictedsoftware
This colelcts applications that have been marked restricted by the Jamf Pro administrator. These are applications that the Jamf Pro, if it has the ability, will remove from the device
/JSSResource/scripts
This collects the scripts that could be deployed to a computer. Combine this with Smart Groups to find all of the computers with these scripts installed
/JSSResource/sites
This collections the multi-tenancy information available with sites. Sites is less used feature that allows a hierarchical setup to your Jamf Pro server. This exposes those relationships
/JSSResource/users
This allows you to collect on users that the Jamf Pro server has seen. You can correlate assigned devices with this endpoint
/JSSResource/vppassignments
This shows the applications that were purchased through the Apple Volume Purchasing Program and either which user or which device it is deployed to.
Installation and Setup
After acquiring and installing onto your instance this Modular Input you will be presented a form with the below 
Input Data fields 
Name: This is the unique name for the data search
Interval: This is the number of seconds it should wait between collecting. The suggestions are 3600 (1 hour) or 86400 (1 day)
Name of Modular Input: This is the name used for the search field it is suggested to be the same as Name
JSS URL : This is the FQDN endpoint for your Jamf Pro server. Your Splunk server must have either 443 or 8443 access to this port depending on your deployment. Valid inputs are https://yourserver.domain.com https://yourserver.domain.com:8443 yourserver.domain.com
Search Name: This is either the Advanced Search name used for the Computer or Mobile Device or it is the Custom API URI field to collect additional information from the Jamf Pro besides Computer or Mobile Device information
Username: Refer to your documentation on how to create read only accounts and ensuring that the account has the correct and appropriate access rights to your data
Password: The password for the user or service account that will be used to collect this information. 
Custom Index Name and Custom Host Name: These are data fields for advanced Splunk Users to allow multiple inputs or multiple hosts to appear as a single input.
Index:

Upgrading the Add-on to v1.1.0 from 1.0.0

If you want to disable SSL certificate validation, then follow the below steps:
Navigate to path: $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-purestorage-unified/local/. If folder local is not present at the location: $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-purestorage-unified/, create folder named local at the location.
Check for file: ta_purestorage_unified_settings.conf at location: $SPLUNK_HOME/TA-purestorage-unified/local/. If the file is not present, create the file ta_purestorage_unified_settings.conf at the location.
In file $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-purestorage-unified/local/ta_purestorage_unified_settings.conf add stanza purestorage_additional_parameters at the end of the file and set the value of verify_ssl variable to False as done below :
[purestorage_additional_parameters]
    verify_ssl = False
Restart Splunk



APPLICATION SETUP
After installation:

Navigate to PureStorage Unified TA, click on ""Configuration"" page, go to ""System"" tab and then click ""Add"", choose ""System Type"", fill in ""System Name"", ""Server Address"" (without the https scheme) and ""Authentication/JWT Token"" then click the ""Add"" button.
If ""System Type"" is FlashBlade/FlashArray, provide API Token in the ""Authentication/JWT Token"" field.

If ""System Type"" is Pure1, provide JWT Token in the ""Authentication/JWT Token"" field.
Note:

Please follow from the section ""Create Key Pair"" section in the following documentation to generate the JWT token for the Pure1 system: https://blog.purestorage.com/products/introducing-the-pure1-rest-api/. You need to provide the JWT token (not Access token) while configuring a Pure1 system in Splunk.
To get the API token, use the below CLI command that can be issued against FlashArray or FlashBlade.
    pureadmin list --api-token --expose
For System Type Pure1, only one input can be configured corresponding to one Pure1 System. Trying to configure multiple inputs with same Pure1 System is not allowed.





Note:

If you have already configured a FlashBlade or FlashArray Input, then configuring a Pure1 input associated with the same FlashBlade and FlashArray or vice versa would lead to duplicate data/events in Splunk and will increase Splunk data volume and license usage.
The data for Pure1 > metrics/history endpoint will be collected for end_time as current_time - 1hr, because the data is updated with delay in Pure1 API, and Splunk data collection is completed before the delayed update is made available.
If the Start Date configured by the user is greater than current_time - 1hr, data for the metrics/history endpoint will not be collected.",Version 1.1.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/8b8e7c46-43ec-11ec-bfbe-9299a9ad30e8.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,265,0,splunk,5,2,Pure Storage,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/puresplunk,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

-In your inputs.conf, you should set the following in your monitor:// stanza
    sourcetype=incapsula

-Install this App on the Index/HF tier (timestamp, event breaks, and sub-sourcetyping) as well as SH where CIM compliance is required

    Incapsula WAF data should get detected as incapsula:cef
        This data has been normalized to IDS, Network_Traffic, and Web Data Models

    Attack Analytics should get detected as imperva:aa:cef
        This data has been normalized to the Alerts DM

Troubleshooting:
1. All events receiving sourcetype=incapsula (not being sub sourcetyped).
    a. Ensure you installed the TA on the Indexer or HF that processes the events

    b. Validate source data is supported. This addon supports ""Incapsula SIEMintegration"" and ""Imperva Inc Attack Analytics"" sourcetypes in the CEF format.

2. Events with missing action=value.  If you have any events matching this search ""sourcetype=incapsula:cef act=* NOT action=*"", the values from act=* will need to be added to lookups/imperva_vendor_act.csv.  If this happens to you, please send me the act=values so I can update the lookup for everyone!

3. Data being truncated.  Many of the WAF events are quite long, and you likely need to increase the default truncation limit from 10000 to a size large enough to support your data.  If you do have larger events, you should add a local/props.conf with the following

[incapsula:cef]
#set this large a little higher than your largest event and periodically monitor if it is sufficient.
TRUNCATE = 10000

This search can help you identify sourcetypes that get truncated due to truncation limits that are too low

1.0

Initial release

1.1

Added some additional error checking. If a user provides an initial regex that does not compile, the script reverts to the built-in default
The output field now supports multivalues so if a single line contains multiple LUHN verified matches, they will all be returned
The input field now properly supports multivalues as well
Confirmed the app works with 6.5

2.0

Refactored to use Splunk SDK for Python instead of intersplunk
Updated README to a markdown file better suited for the git repository
Extraction regex can be bypassed to speed up checking generally making the command better. (Set disable_extraction=yes. Best used when looking at individual fields of data.)
Added option cc_regex to allow control over this secondary regex (Reference Section: How it Works)
Option output_field was replaced with output_prefix allowing better/more consistent control over output fields.
Output fields are now output_prefix+luhn_check and output_prefix+luhn_matches
Fixed default metadata.
Added appicon images for compatibility with certification.

2.0.1

Removed configuration to force command to run locally to support distributed streaming
Tested compatibility with Splunk 7.2

2.0.2

Small code changes to better support py3 in the future
Tested compatibility with Splunk 7.3

2.0.3

Confirmed compatibility with Splunk 8/py3

2.0.4

Tested compat with Splunk 8.1
Upgraded Splunk SDK to 1.6.14

Prerequisites
This search command is packaged with the following external library:
+ Splunk SDK for Python version 1.6.2 (http://dev.splunk.com/python)
Nothing further is required for this add-on to function.
General Overview
This application intends to add a LUHN algorithm checking capability to Splunk Enterprise so you can easily search logs coming from PCI sources for potential credit card numbers. The goal is for administrators to find this data in order to properly mask it before it comes into Splunk. This command was created because regex checking for credit cards isn't enough.
Possible use cases for this command:

Checking indexed logs for valid credit card numbers
Checking an input file (CSV) for credit card numbers
Checking dashboard input for possible credit card numbers

Command Usage
Using this command will result in two new fields in your data:
ta_luhn_matches         All values matched in the input data
ta_luhn_check                   True|False
The command can be controlled with the following options:



field
default
values
description




disable_extraction
no
yes, no
Disables data extraction. Should be set to 'yes' when you do not require extraction of values from inside other text


input_field
_raw
string value
The field to evaluate for possible credit card numbers


output_prefix
ta_luhn_
string value
Prefix for fields added to events


regex
\d[\d\-\s]{13,30})
regular expression
When extraction is enabled, this looks for all matches within a given data and extracts them for further analysis


ccpattern_regex
see below
regular expression
A credit card number is considered a valid match if it matches this regex and passes the LUHN check.



ccpattern_regex:
(?:4[0-9]{12}(?:[0-9]{3})?|5[1-5][0-9]{14}|6(?:011|5[0-9][0-9])[0-9]{12}|3[47][0-9]{13}|3(?:0[0-5]|[68][0-9])[0-9]{11}|(?:2131|1800|35\d{3})\d{11})
Search samples
Search raw data, extract any sequence of 13-30 characters comprised of digits, spaces, and/or dashes for potential credit card numbers:
sourcetype = pci_log_source | luhn
Look at a single field in a datasource, extraction not required:
sourcetype = pci_log_source | luhn input_field=cc_num_field disable_extraction=""yes""
Specify your own regex for extraction:
sourcetype = pci_log_source | luhn disable_extraction=""no"" input_field=_raw regex=""(\\d+)""
NOTE: You have to escape the regex when providing it via splunk search.
How it works
It basically works like this:

Make sure the input_field exists in the data.
If so, do we need to extract values from it?
If yes, extract all values matching the regex
Loop through all extracted values and compare to ccpattern_regex
If extraction is disabled, skip steps 3-4. Compare the input_field directly to ccpattern_regex
If ccpattern_regex produces a match, compare to luhn algorithm
If LUHN is true, return the result.

If any match is found ta_luhn_check will be set to True. All found matches are stored in ta_luhn_check.

Description
The restartinput command uses the REST API to restart a specified input or script in an app.
This is useful if an input regularly needs to be restarted, as Splunk's scheduler can be used to automatically restart an input, with no command line access or scripting required.
Examples
            | restartinput app=TA-Your_App type=script script=myScript.sh

This example restarts the script myScript found in the app TA-Your_App. 
            | restartinput app=TA-Your_App type=monitor input=lookup.csv

This example restarts a monitored input called lookup.csv from the app context TA-Your_App.

== Description ==
Traffic Ray analyses real time HTTP WEB traffic via Apache Web logs generated on Web hosting servers (including WHM and Cpanel based) and offers visual dashboards representing WEB activity trends and hit patterns across all hosted websites and visitor's IP addresses.
It helps you to uncover malicious hits, suspicious incoming activity patterns, spammy attacks and coordinated penetration attacks targeting any of the hosted websites.
Additionally to that Traffic Ray app helps to discover inefficiencies within actively operating websites and specific pages that leads to excessive bandwidth consumption and reduced server performance.
Traffic Ray allows you to filter stats and visualizations by specific IP address, Hosted website name as well as by entering fragments of Splunk query directly into the dashboard input.
Summary information tables offers extra sorting and drilldown features to dig deeper into details of every IP address or specific Website activity.
== Installation and Setup ==
Traffic Ray uses standard Apache Web server logfiles as the main source of data.
These logs files usually match Splunk sourcetypes of: 'access_combined' or 'access_combined_wcookie'.
Before you can see your Web traffic data within Traffic Ray you need to create index to store data from your apache Web logs and create data inputs.

Install Traffic Ray app first.
Login to your Splunk instance as admin.

Go to Apps -> Manage Apps and follow installation instructions available at that screen to install Traffic Ray app.


Create index (or indexes) to store data from your apache Web logs.

Login to your Splunk instance as admin
Go to: Settings -> Indexes -> [New].
Enter the index name - make sure it starts with 'apache_', for example: 'apache_domlogs' or 'apache_acc_logs'
     Traffic Ray app uses the following base query to retrive data:
     'index=apache_ sourcetype=access_combined  ... ' -- and hence make sure your indexes are named as apache_*
You may leave all other fields empty/at their default values.

Press [Save]


Create data inputs to point to directories on your server where Apache log files are generated (or received from forwarder).

Locate Apache web logs on your server. Run this command (as root user) to get an idea about the web logs location if you're not sure:
     lsof -nP -c apache2 -c httpd | grep -i s_log
To proceed with instructions lets assume that you've created an index named: 'apache_domlogs'
     and the location of your apache web logs on a server is: '/usr/local/apache/domlogs/'
Login to your Splunk instance as admin
Create Data input. Go to:
     Settings -> Data Inputs -> Files & directories -> [New]
""File or Directory"" = /usr/local/apache/domlogs/*
""Blacklist"" = (log.offset|bytes_log|-ftp_log|-(200[0-9]|201[0-3])|(Jan|Feb|Mar|Apr|May|Jun|Jul|Aug)-2014)
     This blacklist regex allows you to exclude FTP logs, irrelevant files and files dated older that September 2014.
     This allows you to limit amount of data inflow into Splunk to avoid overloading your Splunk license limit.
     Adjust it as you see fit.
Click [Next] button.
Sourcetype: click [Select], [Select Sourcetype], Web, access_combined
App Context -> [Traffic Ray]
Host -> [Regular Expression on path]
""Regular Expression"" = \/
     This regular expression allows Traffic Ray to extract domain or subdomain name from the name of the actual log file.
Index -> [apache_domlogs]
Press [Review] button
Press [Submit] button.

Once you completed creation of data input Splunk start indexing your data and you may navigate to Traffic Ray dashboards and start seeing stats almost immediately.

SSL Configuration:

The SSL Connection with Nexus Dashboard Insights is enabled by default. Here the user need to provide SSL certificate in Splunk. To do this follow the below steps:

If your script uses python2.7 for data collection:

Navigate to folder $SPLUNK_HOME$/etc/apps/TA_cisco-NI/bin/ta_cisco_ni/aob_py2
Add your content at the end of the cacert.pem file.



If your script uses python3.7 for data collection:

Navigate to folder $SPLUNK_HOME$/etc/apps/TA_cisco-NI/bin/ta_cisco_ni/aob_py3
Add your content at the end of the cacert.pem file.



If you want to disable SSL Connection, then follow the below steps:

Navigate to folder $SPLUNK_HOME$/etc/apps/TA_cisco-NI/bin
Change the value of VERIFY_SSL from True to False in the cisco_ni_constants.py file (Line Number 4).

DATA GENERATOR
This app is provided with sample data that can be used to generate dummy data. To simulate this sample data, first of all, download the Splunk Event generator, which is available at https://github.com/splunk/eventgen, & needs to be installed at $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/. This app generates the dummy data for the NI environment and populates the dashboards of the main app with the dummy data.
By default eventgen is disabled, you can follow the below steps to enable it:
  * Navigate to folder $SPLUNK_HOME$/etc/apps/TA_cisco-NI/default
  * Change the value of disabled from true to false for both the stanzas.
  * Restart Splunk
Troubleshooting


If the error message SSL certificate verification failed. Please add a valid SSL Certificate or Change the VERIFY_SSL flag to ""False"" is faced while configuring the account.
  Please set the value of the VERIFY_SSL parameter as ""False"" in file $SPLUNK_HOME$/etc/apps/TA_cisco-NI/bin/cisco_ni_constants.py Line Number 4.


If you get any error messages in the Configuration tab on the UI, have a look at the messages coming on the config screen. You can also check logs for validation by using the below query:
index=_internal source=""ta_cisco_ni_account_validation.log""


The main app dashboard can take some time before the data is returned which will populate some of the panels. A good test to see that you are receiving all of the data we expect is to run this search after several minutes:
index=""<your index>"" | stats count by source type


In particular, you should see these source types:

cisco:ni:anomalies

cisco:ni:advisories


If you don't see these source types, please check the logs generated in the Add-on log files. Here is a sample search that will show all the logs generated by Add-on:
index=_internal source=""ta_cisco_ni_cisco_ni.log""


Binary File Declaration
The files having binary code in the addon package, are used and generated by AoB.

Enable API calls to Lacework through custom search command and view vulnerability data through built-in dashboards.
Before you start
The Alerts page only works for those who have a Lacework connector set up (see here). However, you can still use all other existing dashboards in the App without this page if you do not need it.
If you wish to use the alert page: Currently, the app only accepts index=lacework for the alerts data input.
Additional feature to change the index is coming up soon.
How to use

Upon installation, navigate to the app and finish setup by completing the setup form. This will help us fetch your Lacework API token and enable all functionalities of the app.
The custom search command ""lacework"" sends a GET request to a Lacework endpoint.
Example: | lacework target=""/api/v1/...""



Supported custom endpoints
The following endpoint allows you to get or update the current domain without going through the setup page. This is useful in case the setup page does not work and direct modification on configuration files is not viable.
Note: Make sure you provide username and password in Basic Authorization.
GET https://localhost:PORT/services/apiDomain/APIDomainHandler has an optional parameter of domain
- GET https://localhost:PORT/services/apiDomain/APIDomainHandler gets the current domain
- GET https://localhost:PORT/services/apiDomain/APIDomainHandler?domain=exampleDomain to update the current domain to exampleDomain.lacework.net

Q: My dashboard is showing empty results/ no accounts found/ no CVE IDs found
A:
- Re-do your setup from the setupage (""Manage Apps"" -> ""Lacework"" -> ""Set up"") to ensure that the credentials are valid.
- Refresh the page to reload your dashboard. 
- If this still does not work, please restart the server OR the setupReload.sh script from ""Settings"" -> ""Data Inputs"" -> ""Scripts"" by toggling the Enable/Disable status buttons. This script will reload your setup configuration.
- Note: Dashboards may also take a while to load, so please give it up to a minute to load the data in.
Q: How do I change my setup credentials outside of setup page?
A: You can either modify the file(s) directly as an admin, or use Splunk's endpoint and our EAI endpoint.
- For keyId and secret, please use Splunk's storage passwords endpoints to modify the passwords.conf file.
- For API domain, please use the https://localhost:PORT/services/apiDomain/APIDomainHandler endpoint. See 'Supported custom endpoints' section.
Q: How do I change the index that stores the logs from the scripts?
A: ""Settings"" -> ""Data Inputs"" -> ""Scripts"" -> Find setupReload.sh -> Click on the name -> Change fields from the ""Source type"" section.",Version 1.1.4,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/8910a53e-e663-11eb-9d18-02860ecfd319.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,237,0,splunk,0,0,Amy Ying,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/amyying,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

Splunk on Splunk installation instructions for Splunk 5.x/6.x
Please consult Splunk Answers to learn about best practices to deploy the S.o.S app in a distributed environment.
1) If Sideview Utils version 1.1.7 (or later) is not installed, please install or update it before installing S.o.S.
Download Sideview Utils from Splunkbase
2) Install the S.o.S app:
If you have a distributed search environment, make sure you install S.o.S on the search-head(s) only. From the search-head the app can discover search-peers present in the distributed deployment.
3) Download and install the Splunk on Splunk add-on (S.o.S TA) on search peers to provide resource usage information to S.o.S.

Download the S.o.S add-on for Unix and Linux
Download the S.o.S add-on for Windows

This add-on provides data inputs that gather memory and CPU usage for Splunk Web, splunkd, and search processes as well as other system resource information. For more information, see the README file available with the S.o.S TAs.
Note: You do not need to install the S.o.S add-on on a Splunk instance were the S.o.S app is already installed.

Two Dashboards and six saved searches/reports:

Rails Request Overview provides charts and tables that show requests over time, average, min, and max request times by Controller#action, and breakdowns by render and db time
Rails stats show basic stats around top action, method, and clients

Permissions
By default, permissions are set at the app level - users in the 'admin' role have read and write permissions.
You can change the app level permissions by navigating to Manager >> Apps >> Rails ""Permissions"". Use caution!
Field Extractions
To ensure that field extractions are working properly, you will need to ensure that the correct source type is linked to the field extractions.
By default, the app will already work if your rails events are coming in under the source type ""rails"".
Otherwise, you should copy $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/rails/default/props.conf to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/rails/local/props.conf, and change the existing rails stanza to the source type that contains your Rails production data.
For example, to set the field extractions to work with the source type foobar, $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/rails/local/props.conf should look as follows:
[foobar]
#field extractions
EXTRACT-rails-db = ((ActiveRecord:)|(DB:))\s(?<db_time>[\d.]*)
EXTRACT-rails-render = ((Views:)|(View:)|(Rendering:))\s(?<render_time>[\d.]*)

EXTRACT-rails-response = Completed in.* \| (?P<response_code>\d{3})\s(?<response_msg>\S+)\s\[(?<response_uri>\S*)\]

KSCONF is a command-line tool that helps administrators and developers manage their Splunk environments by enhancing control of their configuration files.  The interface is modular so that each function (or subcommand) can be learned quickly and used independently.  While most users will probably only use a subset of the total capabilities of this tool, it’s reassuring to have a comprehensive toolbox of powerful assets ready to be utilized at a moment's notice.  Ksconf works with, rather than replace, your existing Splunk deployment mechanisms and version control tools.
KSCONF is open source and an open development effort.  Check us out on GitHub
Pronounced:   k·s·kȯnf
Design principles

Ksconf is a toolbox.  - Each tool has a specific purpose and function that works independently.  Borrowing from the Unix philosophy, each command should do one small thing well and be easily combined to handle higher-order tasks.
When possible, be familiar. - Various commands borrow from popular UNIX command line tools such as “grep” and “diff”.  The overall modular nature of the command is similar to the modular interface used by “git” and the “splunk” cli.
Don’t impose workflow. - Ksconf works with or without version control and independently of your deployment mechanisms. If you are looking to implement these things, ksconf is a great building block.
Embrace automated testing. - It’s impractical to check every scenario between each release, but significant work has gone into unit testing the CLI to avoid breaks between releases.

Common uses for ksconf

Promote changes from “local” to “default”
Maintain multiple independent layers of configurations
Reduce duplicate settings in a local file
Upgrade apps stored in version control
Merge or separate configuration files
Push .conf stanzas to a REST endpoint (send custom configs to Splunk Cloud)

What's in the KSCONF App for Splunk?
This Splunk app comes bundled with a CLI tool that helps manage other Splunk apps.  While this is not a traditional use case for a Splunk app, it is a very quick and easy way to deploy ksconf.
Why did we make this a Splunk app? While ksconf is technically just a Python package that can be deployed in a variety of ways, we found that the logistics of getting it deployed can be quite difficult due to a packaging issues, legacy cruft, and OS limitations. This approach avoids all that mess.
Getting Started
Full documentation for ksconf, including this app, is hosted at read-the-docs.  A full copy of the ksconf documentation is also included, similar to how Splunk ships with a full copy of the docs in the system/README folder.

Simply install through the UI (or extract into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps) and the visualization will be available as an option alongside the default Splunk or other custom visualizations:

(I found the method for the integer->dotted quad IPv4 segment of this search in this Splunk Answer
The visualization has two tabs of configurable properties. The first tab handles the globe rendering, background, zoom, and UI. You can enable or disable both the control panel in the upper left and the legend in the lower right. If you have selected ""Starfield"" as the background, the background color option will have no effect. There are eight zoom levels (0-7).

The second tab handles the globe's animation. Static disables rotation whereas Animated rotates the globe at a frequency defined in the rotation period option (number of seconds for the globe to make a complete rotation along its vertical axis). The rotation period option does nothing if ""Static"" is selected.

In the UI, the controls in the upper left pan and tilt the globe, and provide zoom control. You may also drag the globe with the mouse (even if animated!) to pan/tilt/zoom. The legend in the lower right is build dynamically based upon the <by-clause> of the | geostats command. For more information on geostats, view the Splunk Geostats Documentation

Compatability
The app and TA extracts information and knowledge from Zeek (formerly known as Bro) via Corelight Sensors or open-source Zeek, resulting in powerful security insights through key traffic dashboards such as:

Intel: Find IOCs from external sources matched in network traffic.
Notices: See situations flagged by the Notice policy for further investigation.
IP Interrogation: Identify anomalies by reviewing top protocol usage, internal vs. external connections, top connections by bytes transferred and more.
Log Hunting: Accelerate your hunt by narrowing down many logs to only the logs that matter.
Detections: Find and respond to off-port protocol usage, IOC matches, and other potentially interesting events.
Connections: Gain situational awareness using lists of top services, ports, dataflows, originators, and responders.
HTTP: Find suspicious HTTP transactions by reviewing a list of top host headers, originators, rare user agents and rare host headers.
DNS: Detect DNS exfiltration by spotting queries to non-existent domains and high connection counts.
Files: Find executables hidden in benign extensions and compressed files.
Corelight Egress Monitor: Find risky North/South user connections to weak SSL versions.

Known Issues
Version 2.0.0 of Corelight App For Splunk has the following known issues:
