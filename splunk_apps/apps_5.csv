OVERVIEW
TA-opd scans for open ports. This app should be installed on your Heavy Forwarder. Nmap will also need to be installed. The app will look for nmap in these paths:
- nmap
- /usr/bin/nmap
- /usr/local/bin/nmap
- /sw/bin/nmap
- /opt/local/bin/nmap
These are the only files that the app may access outside the app directory.
This app uses python-nmap
(https://bitbucket.org/xael/python-nmap) to run Nmap commands. The following modular inputs can be set up:
- Banner Scan (sourcetype=opd:banners)
- Full Scan (sourcetype=opd:full)
- Quick Scan (sourcetype=opd:quick)
- Version Scan (sourcetype=opd:versions)
A separate app called 'Hurricane Labs Open Port Detection' can be installed on your Search Head from which you can utilize
additional saved searches and dashboards along with possible Shodan integration.
SPLUNK VERSION SUPPORT
7.0, 6.6
INSTALLATION

Make sure TA-opd is installed on a Heavy Forwarder and is sending data to sourcetype=opd.

Learn how Splunk Enterprise may be used to detect various forms of fraud using the example scenarios in Splunk Security Essentials for Fraud Detection. Each detection use case includes a description of how it was implemented using the Search Processing Language (SPL) and the Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK). The use cases include example data sets so you may run them yourself. After learning about these examples you should be ready to start experimenting with similar scenarios on your own data using Splunk Enterprise. 
What is the Splunk Security Essentials For Fraud Detection App?
Learn ways to detect fraudsters with Splunk software by examining the example use cases in this free app. This app uses Splunk Enterprise and the power of our Search Processing Language (SPL) to showcase working examples of fraud detection. Each use case includes sample data and searches that can be used as a reference to help implement use cases in your environment. The example use cases give analysts the ability to detect potentially fraudulent activities in healthcare insurance claims, payment card purchases and wire transfers. Each use case includes a description, an explanation of how the search works and pointers to keep in mind when implementing similar use cases on your own data. 
Use Cases:
Healthcare Insurance Billing

Providers with very abnormal prescriptions 
Provider peer group profile 

Payment Cards

High risk cards 
Risky transactions 
Victimized merchants 

Wire Transfer

Customers with abnormal behavior
Account Profiling
Account Behavior Profile

Dependencies:
Splunk Security Essentials for Fraud Detection depends on the following apps
Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit
Python for Scientific Computing
Clustered Single Value Map Visualization
3D Scatterplot
All above apps can be downloaded for free from Splunkbase. When installing these apps please select the appropriate platform.
Make sure these apps are properly installed in your Splunk environment before installing this app.
Data Sources Used
Example Healthcare Insurance Billing logs 
Example Credit Card transaction logs 
Eventgen for wire transfer demo
Performance Impact
The example use cases are intended to demonstrate possible detection logic. These use cases are not necessarily optimized for performance. When implementing use cases in your environment based on this logic please make sure to optimize for your specific deployment and data sets. 
Detection Methods Used by the Searches
Splunk SPL searches
Machine Learning Toolkit
Quick Installation Suggestions
Due to very large size of the app - it may be a challenge to install it via normal, GUI way.
Here are suggested steps to install this app in a faster, more reliable manner:
- Download the app to your computer
- Unzip it manually (via WinRar or 7Zip or related linux utilities)
- If you do not need Healthcare demo - you may delete Healthcare dataset - all files under ./Splunk-SE-Fraud-Detection/DATA/af-cms* - this will greatly reduce the size of the app as well.
- Move ./Splunk-SE-Fraud-Detection tree under ./etc/apps of your Splunk installation 
- Restart Splunk
- If you included (did not delete) healthcare datasets - give app some time (30-60 minutes) to index the complete datasets. Once indexing is finished (af-cms-* indexes stopped growing) - the app is ready for use",Version 1.0.1,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/4d99b9a4-9f19-11e7-baa1-02f13bdc2585.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance, Utilities",http://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-software-license-agreement.html,"4,750",0,splunk,5,3,Splunk Works,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/splunklabs,"Products: Splunk Enterprise

Hive updated their authentication API which broke version v1.0.1 of this add-on.  The authentication code has been updated to used AWS Cognito SRP and is now working again.  
Pre-requisites
This add-on is only useful for owners of the Hive Active Heating System - https://www.hivehome.com
In order to configure the add-on you need to enter your Hive username and password.  These credentials are stored locally on your Splunk server and the password is encrypted.
The system running the add-on will need to be able to hit the API, so an internet connection either direct or through an HTTPS proxy is required.
OS Support
This add-on has been developed using the Splunk Add-On builder.  It has been developed and tested on Mac OSX but should work on other OS as well.
Notes
This app is provided for those interested in monitoring and optimising their home heating system.  It is entirely dependent on the Hive Home API, which does not appear to be supported by Centrica.  Further development of the add-on is planned and feedback is welcome.
If a more industrial version of this add-on is required, e.g. for commercial or high end usage, please contact us via the developer email listed.
Setup
Once the add-on is installed, setup is straightforward:
1. From the Configuration screen click 'Add' then choose a name (e.g. HiveAccount) and enter your Hive account username and password
2. From the Inputs screen click 'Create New Input' then choose a name for the input (e.g. getNodes), enter a polling interval to instruct the add-on how often to collect data (e.g. 120), select the index that the data is to be written to and finally choose the account that you setup in step 1
3. The add-on should start to poll the Hive API and collect your data
Troubleshooting
The following search checks the add-on log: 
index=_internal source=*hive* source=""*/var/log/splunk/ta_add_on_for_hive_hive_nodes.log""
The following search checks splunkd type log files for messages relating to the add-on:
index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd hive
Usage
Once data is indexed the following search can be used to provide a timechart of the data.  The screenshot shown in this add-on listing is a stats version of this search displayed as trellis single value visualisations.
index=main sourcetype=""hivehome:nodes"" protocol=ZIGBEE

APT3.

It shows data and dashboards from the JSON data published in the MITRE ATTACK evaluations
Why does this Splunk app exist?
To make it easier to play with the EDR evaluation results. The JSON files from MITRE weren't that friendly for slicing and dicing in Splunk, so I write a Python script to transpose them for APT3 and APT29 here, and included that data in this app for onboarding in Splunk.
How do I use this app?

Install from Splunkbase (or git clone from Github, if you download the .zip file please remember to rename the directory to ""EDRevals"")

Splunk platform component
Supported
Required
Comments




Search Heads
Yes
Yes
This add-on contains search-time knowledge. It is recommended to turn visibility off on your search heads to prevent data duplication errors that can result from running inputs on your search heads instead of (or in addition to) on your data collection node.


Heavy Forwarders
Yes
No (but recommended)
It is recommended to install this add-on on a heavy forwarder for data collection.


Indexers
Yes
No
Not required as the parsing operations occur on the forwarders.


Universal Forwarders
No
No
Universal forwarders are not supported for data collection because the modular inputs require Python and the Splunk REST handler.



Configuration
Call Records
Collecting call record data is a 3-step process:
1. Create a Teams Webhook input
Microsoft Teams will push call record header data to Splunk via HTTPS.

From the add-on, select Inputs > Create New Input > Teams Webhook
Specify a name for the webhook
Specify an interval for the webhook - the webhook will run continuously, but the interval will be used for a health check and restart the webhook if necessary.
Specify an open port for the webhook

Note: The Teams Webhook is not available for Splunk Cloud installations.  Consider Azure Functions as an alternative.
2. Create a Teams Subscription input
A subscription instructs Microsoft Teams to start sending call record header data to a specified HTTPS webhook.

From the add-on, select Configuration > Account > Add
Enter a name, client ID, and client secret for the account
Required permission for the subscription account = Subscriptions.Read.All (Delegated)
Select Inputs > Create New Input > Teams Subscription
Specify an interval for the subscription - 86400 (24 hours) is a typical interval for this field.
Select an account
Enter your tenant ID
Enter the URL for the webhook created above

Notes:

The Webhook URL must be publicly accessible and HTTPS.
It is recommended to use a load balancer, reverse proxy, or tunnel in front of your Splunk Heavy Forwarder running the add-on.
Updating the Webhook URL after creating the subscription is not supported.  Please create a new subscription input with a different name if you need to update the Webhook URL.

3. Create a Teams Call Record input
The call record input uses the call record header received by the webhook to retrieve a complete call record from the Teams REST API.

Select Inputs > Create New Input > Teams Call record
Specify an interval - specifies how often the input will enumerate call record headers received by the webhook and issue GET requests to the Teams REST API.
Select an account
Required permission for the call record account = CallRecords.Read.All (Application)
Enter your tenant ID

Note: Teams Webhook inputs and Teams Call Record inputs should run on the same system.  A load balancer may be used to scale out multiple systems.
Aggregated User Reports

From the add-on, select Configuration > Account > Add
Enter a name, client ID, and client secret for the account
Required permission for the user report account = Reports.Read.All (Delegated and Application)
Select Inputs > Create New Input > Teams User Report
Specify an interval for the subscription - 86400 (24 hours) is a typical interval for this field.
Select an account
Enter your tenant ID
Select a report period

Disabling Access
Splunk uses an Azure Active Directory application registration to access Microsoft Teams data. Access to Microsoft Teams data may be disabled from the Azure portal by modifying the Azure Active Directory application registration permissions or removing the Azure Active Directory application. 
Privacy
Use of this add-on is permitted subject to your obligations, including data privacy obligations, under your agreement with Splunk and Splunk's Privacy Policy.

As an Okta customer, your Okta instance captures valuable information regarding user activities, and application access over time – including details about devices, location, browser information, etc.  This app collects data through the Okta platform APIs with the primary focus on system log events.  The app can also present the “latest snapshot” on users, groups and apps.
Out-of-the-box dashboards are provided to give immediate insights on your Okta data based on events.  
Here is a high-level architectural diagram of the integration.

Prerequisite:
Before setting up Splunk App for Okta, the following is needed from an Okta administrator:
An Okta administrator must create an appropriate Okta API key which will be used by the Splunk App to import data from Okta.  The API key should ideally belong to a system user as opposed to an actual “human” user.  A recommended approach is the following:
a.  Create a new Okta user as a dedicated Splunk App account.
b.    Assign the appropriate admin role to give this account the right level of privileges.  If Splunk app is used in a read-only mode without the callbacks to Okta, the account should be given read-only access.  If callbacks are planned, then a higher privileged admin role should be granted.
c.  Remember that an API key should be carefully protected as it can be used in a malicious manner especially when it has access to Okta beyond read-only.
d.  To create an API key
   i.    Log in as the Okta user you intend to associate the API key with.
   ii.   Go to Security->API and create a Token

You can test the API key using the following cURL command:
curl -H ""Authorization:SSWS <token>"" -H “Accept:application/json” -H “Content-type:application/json”  https://<your_okta_org>.okta.com/api/v1/events?startDate=2015-01-01T00%3A00%3A00.000Z&limit=1
The “startDate” and “limit” parameters are optional – but should be considered if your Okta org has been LIVE for some time and contains a large amount of log data.
Installation and Configuration
a.  Install the Splunk Add-on for Okta
b.  Install the Splunk App for Okta 
Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Can I use a read-only API key for this integration
A: Yes.  A read-only API key will suffice for all the out-of-the-box dashboards in Splunk.  However, to leverage the Okta Commands which will modify user status/group membership within Okta, the API key will need to be associated with a user with ""super admin"" privileges.
Q:  Can I associate multiple Okta orgs with a single Splunk App for Okta instance?
A:  Yes. As part of the Splunk Add-on for Okta, each modular input entry can be pointed to a new Okta instance. Just Add as many modular input entries as needed. 
Q:  Is there a dashboard capturing LDAP (non-AD) agent activities?
A:  The out-of-the-box dashboard only supports AD agents.  We will enhance the out-of-the-box dashboard in the future to include generic LDAP agent activities.  However, the data is imported under ""index=okta"".  You can build custom queries/dashboards on top of that.
Q:  As an Okta customer, is SAML supported between Splunk Cloud and Okta (as part of the Okta Application Network)?
A:  This currently being worked on.  Stay tuned.
Q:  It has been more than 24 hours and the data is still coming in.  Is that normal?
A:  The ""24 hours"" window is an estimate.  The time for the initial import really depends on the amount of data that is coming in.  Again, the best gauge is to look at ""index=okta"" and see if the latest event has caught up with the current time.",Version 1.0.1,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/34ef0d00-e6a3-11e8-a33c-02f13bdc2585.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAAFA,"2,413",0,splunk,4,6,Splunk Works,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/splunklabs,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

Splunk App that auto updates the max-mind database (used for iplocation command)
Find Sourcecode on GitHub - https://github.com/VatsalJagani/Splunk-App-Auto-Update-MaxMind-Database
OVERVIEW
The Splunk app auto updates MaxMind database. The database update happens automatically every week. Also, user can update database just by running a search query. This is automation of steps mentioned here - https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.1.3/SearchReference/Iplocation#Updating_the_MMDB_file

Compatible with:
OS: Platform independent
Browser: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari

TOPOLOGY AND SETTING UP SPLUNK ENVIRONMENT
This app can be set up in two ways: 
  1. Standalone Mode: 
     * Install the Auto Update MaxMind Database.
     * App setup is required.
  2. Distributed Mode: 
     * Install the Auto Update MaxMind Database only on the search head.
     * App setup is required on SH.
     * App installation is not required on any other instance.
INSTALLATION
Follow the below-listed steps to install an App from the bundle:

Download the App package.
From the UI navigate to Apps > Manage Apps.
In the top right corner select Install app from file.
Select Choose File and select the App package.
Select Upload and follow the prompts.

CONFIGURATION

Open the App and perform the configuration.
The complete details about configuration is present on the dashboard directly.
See troubleshooting for more details.

INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION FOR INDEXER CLUSTER

iplocation is distributed command, so based on search queries Splunk will decide whether the command is executed on SH or indexers. So it is recommended to deploy the App on Search Head as well as on indexers.
Follow below steps to deploy App on indexers.

Way-1: Deploy on all indexers from cluster master.
Note - If you do not want to add Max Mind License key in plain text, use Way-2.

App will be pushed from cluster master so, you don't have to deploy App manually on each indexer separately.
Download the App build from Splunkbase.
Extract the downloaded app build on Cluster master's $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/master-apps/ directory.
Create local directory under $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/master-apps/splunk_maxmind_db_auto_update/.
Add app.conf file in the newly created local folder.

[install]
is_configured = 1

Add passwords.conf file in the newly created local folder. And replace <LICENSE_KEY> in the below code with your MaxMind license key.

[credential:splunk_maxmind_db_auto_update:max_mind_license_key``splunk_cred_sep``1:]
password = <LICENSE_KEY>
Way-2: Deploy on each indexer manually
Follow INSTALLATION and CONFIGURATION section from above to install and deploy app on indexer. The process is same as hwo you deploy App on Search Head.
UNINSTALL APP
To uninstall app, user can follow below steps:
 SSH to the Splunk instance
 Go to folder apps($SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps)
 Remove the splunk_maxmind_db_auto_update folder from apps directory
 Restart Splunk
KNOWN LIMITATION

NA

OPEN SOURCE COMPONENTS AND LICENSES

NA

TROUBLESHOOTING

Update database manually.
Run | maxminddbupdate search from the Auto Update MaxMind Database App.
In ideal scenario, it should show message Max Mind Database updated successfully..
Confirm that the database location has been updated:
Run | rest /services/configs/conf-limits splunk_server=local | search title=""iplocation"" | table title, db_path.
The results should show /opt/splunk/etc/apps/splunk_maxmind_db_auto_update/local/mmdb/GeoLite2-City.mmdb. Where /opt/splunk is your Splunk home path, it could be different in your environment.

• The overview dashboard’s purpose is to give a general, high level overview over the sessions recorded by Balabit PSM and analyzed by Balabit PAA. It contains aggregated counters of sessions, line charts showing trends, maximum score values over time, as well as a table showing sessions in the selected time period. It builds on data that is constantly being updated, in near real-time.
• The user profile dashboard shows the behavioral profile or baseline of individual users. It is fed by the balabit_profiles index, and shows various information, including:
  • Name of user
  • LDAP/Windows AD groups the user is a member of
  • Login time probability distribution
  • Hosts most frequently accessed
  • Commands that have been most frequently issued by the user
  • Window titles that have been most often observed in the user’s RDP sessions
• The detailed session analytics dashboard shows detailed information about a single selected session only, including not only general information about the session, but the aggregated risk score and individual algorithm scores as well.
Customers can customize Balabit PAA to their specific needs by fine-tuning the algorithms.",Version 1.0.1,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/abae302a-df0a-11e7-8850-02f13bdc2585.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT,227,0,splunk,5,1,One Identity,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/krasznay,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

Add-on to monitor and parse Splunk configuration files. This TA is adapted tom use on Splunk Enterprise Servers.
You need to install the Splunk-App_Confversion to see the results.
Installation and configuration
Splunk Components

This TA can be installed on all Splunk components including Universal Forwarders.
This TA should be installed and configured on all components where configuration change tracking is desired.
This TA must be installed on Indexers and intermediate HFs, as it contains index-time transforms. 
This TA must be installed on Search Heads, as it comes bundled with important KOs for viewing the indexed configuration data.

Configuration

Note: The app in this repo comes pre-configured with files in local/. The version on SplunkBase is not preconfigured, and requires the following manual steps.
You can use local/*.conf files in this repo as templates to cofngiure the app in your environment.

Create an index called splunk_confchange (local/indexes.conf) if you do not wish to ingest these logs into. (recommended).

Optional: Create local/macros.conf and override the conf_files_index to point at the index you prefer to chose instead of the one in the step above. 

...
[conf_files_index]
definition = (index = splunk_confchange)
...

Optional: Create local/inputs.conf to designate the index you prefer to chose and enable the inputs.

...
index = splunk_confchange
...
File change monitor polling interval
By default, Splunk logs changes in the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/ directory every 10 minutes.
In some cases, it may be desirable to do this more frequently, to ensure that no filechanges are missed.
If this is desired, add the following to local/inputs.conf:
...
[fschange:$SPLUNK_HOME/etc]
#poll every 30 seconds
pollPeriod = 30
...
This change can cause added load on the system on the beguining. Ensure you are comfortable with that before implementing this change. 
Optional Changes to get more results
In fact wihtin this release you are able to see all changes, even also those in dahsboards (.xml files).
If you don't want to see all changes by default, then you need to adapt the props.conf and remove the xml value on the following extractions:

A collection of ultra-configurable, single-statistic visualizations for Splunk.  Contains three main types of viz: Gauges, Spinners and SVG shapes (Square, Rectangle, Hexagon, Rings and donuts). Similar to Graphana singlestat panel.

Known issue: Splunk  can be laggy (causing formatting options to not apply) with visualizations that have many formatting options. Please be patient when the formatting form is opening and when switching formatting tabs. If the form opens twice and overlaps, then the settings won't save properly.

Getting started
This app is not ""visible"" in the Splunk UI app menu. After installing the app, follow this process:
1. Do a search of any data and switch to the visualisation tab
2. In the top left, in the visualisastion menu, select ""Number Display viz""
3. Open the ""Format"" menu then select ""Help""
4. There will be a link to the in-app documentation, which includes working examples

Usage
This visualization can deal with most datasets you want to throw at it. However for the most reliable results, use a search where the field names are exactly ""value"", ""title"" and ""sparkline"".
|stats sparkline(avg(SOME_VALUE)) as sparkline latest(SOME_VALUE) as value
For multiple items do this: 
| rename SPLIT_CATEGORY as title | stats sparkline(avg(SOME_VALUE)) as sparkline latest(SOME_VALUE) as value BY title
The configured viz formatting can be overridden in data by havign specifically named fields.
Here is an example where the subtitle is supplied in the data:
| rename SPLIT_CATEGORY as title | stats sparkline(avg(SOME_VALUE)) as sparkline latest(SOME_VALUE) as value latest(SOME_VALUE2) as subtext BY title
another way of doing the same thing is like so: 
| rename SPLIT_CATEGORY as title | stats sparkline(avg(SOME_VALUE)) as sparkline latest(SOME_VALUE) as value BY title | eval subtext = ""something""
These are the fields that can be overridden in data:



Field
Type
Description




value
Numeric
The value which will be used for threshold calculation and to set the gauge position or spinner speed. Viz will attempt to autoguess this field if not explicity supplied.


title
String
The title of the metric which will be shown as a text overlay. Viz will attempt to autoguess this field if not explicity supplied.


sparkline
sparkline array
The sparkline field to use as the area or line chart overlay. Viz will attempt to autoguess this field if not explicity supplied.


color
HTML color code
Set the base color, ignoring the thresholds. By using this field you can use any threshold logic you like in the search query


primarycolor
HTML color code
Similar to above but will only override the primary color. The threshold color can still be used by other components. The primary color is only used by the main element (the gauge, spinner or shape background) in the viz.


secondarycolor
HTML color code
As above.


text
String
If supplied, this field enables overriding what would be shown as the numeric value


subtitle
String
Override the subtitle value. Note that subtitle must be blank in the formatting options


min
Number
Overrides the ""min"" limit


max
Number
Overrides the ""max"" limit




Formatting options


Set the height. Since most Styles have a fixed aspect ratio this also sets the width. When blank it will automatically determine the size so that all items can fit on a single line. Items will split onto multiple lines when using a hardcoded size if there is not enough space.
Set the minimum horizontal spacing between items. 
The data limits are important for the gauge and spinner styles only.
Set thresholds and leave any blank that are not needed. If you need more thresholds or non-numeric thresholds then compute them in the search query and pass the color as the color field.

The primary and secondary fields are the colors that are used by the main style component such as the gauge, spinner, or the shape color. This allows the color to be set to a static color and the threshold color to be used for the textvalue overlay, the sparkline or other places. Exactly what the primary or secondary color affects is different for each style, however it is typically a gradient range. If the Primary and Secondary color are set exactly the same then some of the shape textures will not be visible. 


To show a sparkline, then be sure to pass in sparkline data. use | stats sparkline(AGG_FUNCTION(VALUE))


The Text, Title, Subtitle tabs allow for configuring how text overlays are applied. They are all kind of the same except the text value can have animations on change, and a unit prefix/suffix.

If the data has a sparkline field but no value field then the last value of the sparkline will be used.
The Title and Subtitle options should be left blank to use values from the data instead.
Advanced font styles are hosted by Google Fonts so these won't work unless the viewer has an internet connection.




Icons
The title, text, or subtitle fields allow for HTML injection. This allows icons to be used in place of text or numbers. 
Any icon from the FontAwesome v5 Free icon sets can be used, the complete list is here: https://fontawesome.com/cheatsheet/
There are also some Splunk built-in icons that can be used. See the list at the following page of your Splunk environment: /en-GB/static/docs/style/style-guide.html#icons
Here is an example search query to display an icon:


Custom fonts
It is possible to use custom fonts (hosted on the internet) by overriding specific CSS classes in a HTML panel: .number_display_viz-font1 .. font5. 
Example: https://git.io/fjz5B

Version: 6.0
Developed by: Mike Wilson (mwilson at splunk.com)
Noteworthy

The latest version of Splunk seems to have changed something in the way LD_LIBRARY_PATH is handled.  If you are not receiving scan data and you're sure that everything is enabled and setup properly, it's quite possible that you're just being affected by this.  More information and a fix can be found here: http://answers.splunk.com/answers/105439/no-port_scan-data.  Please let me know if you encounter this issue.
Notes on the Windows scripted input, nmap.cmd (which calls nmap.vbs): You must create the file bin\nmap.path which contains the full path to your nmap.exe (i.e. C:\Program Files\Nmap\nmap.exe). There is an example_nmap.path in the bin directory. If you do not do this, the input will fail. The Windows scripts are lightly tested, please report bugs.
General

This app utilizes its own ""asset_discovery"" index. All searches have been created to use eventtypes which reference index=asset_discovery which can easily be overriden depending on your needs.
This app utilizes the nmap command, but does not provide it. It assumes that the command is available and in the path. Additionally, the nmap binary works best if it is run as root. Running as a standard user will most likely yield unexpected results.
This app utilizes a scripted input, nmap.sh or nmap.cmd, to execute nmap scans of (hopefully) any type. The included scripted input will automatically include the necessary argument for ""Grepable"" output format as defined by nmap.org.
The scripted input will attempt to find the current host's IP address and, if no other target is given, use that IP to perform a scan of the local subnet. In this way, the app can be deployed to remote forwarders to regularly scan the forwarder's subnet, without having to configure the target for each individual forwarder. This behavior can be overriden by passing a ""-t target_spec"" argument to the script.
With no arguments given, the scripted input will perform a ping scan of the local subnet of the current system:
nmap -oG - -v -R -sP -PE 192.168.1.158/24
You may pass standard nmap arguments through in order to perform a port scan. An input of ""nmap.sh -A -O"" will yield:
nmap -oG - -A -O 192.168.1.158/24
In order to set a target, use the ""-t"" option (not a standard nmap option). ""nmap.cmd -t 10.159.1.100-150"" will yield:
nmap -oG - -v -R -sP -PE 10.158.1.100-150
Customizing scan targets

In the event that you'd prefer to have a small number of scan points which will scan multiple networks you'll need to create some custom data inputs. There are 2 types of inputs for this app: ping scans and port scans. Knowing that, from your Splunk instance (i.e. the scan point) head to Manager -> Data Inputs -> Scripts and search for ""nmap"". There should be 4 results, a ping scan and port scan for *nix, and the same for Windows. Find the appropriate input and ""Clone"" it. Enter the proper command for your situation (e.g. For a port scan of 2 subnets, something like: /opt/splunk/demo/etc/apps/asset_discovery/bin/nmap.sh -A -O -t 10.159.26.0/24 -t 10.59.27.0/24) and leave the remaining fields alone, click ""Save"".
You can have a single scan which has many targets, per the previous example, or you may create new inputs for each in the event that you'd like to stagger their execution, etc. You should be able to pass in any standard nmap arguments. A ""-oG"" option will be automatically inserted in order to force the ""Grepable"" format. Targets should be prefixed with a ""-t"" switch per the example.
Connections

Internal:
Only those network connection which are initiated by nmap for the purpose of scanning.
External:
None
Troubleshooting

The nmap.sh or nmap.cmd scripted input can be run directly from the command line for testing.  However, nmap's stderr is redirected to null, so you may want to comment that out when testing (e.g., change 2>/dev/null to #2>/dev/null)
Known Issues

The latest version of Splunk seems to have changed something in the way LD_LIBRARY_PATH is handled.  If you are not receiving scan data and you're sure that everything is enabled and setup properly, it's quite possible that you're just being affected by this.  More information and a fix can be found here: http://answers.splunk.com/answers/105439/no-port_scan-data
Port Signature chart will be empty when drilling down from an ""OS Signature"" chart to the
port overview. This is because of quoting issues in a match operation which I don't have
an elegant fix for currently

Background
This app includes GeoLite data created by MaxMind, available from http://www.maxmind.com/
The Add-On is based on Will Hayes @ Splunk's MAXMIND Geo Location Lookup Script, but it has been rewritten to use the native Maxmind C libraries, for increased speed and functionality. GeoASN requires that you build the Maxmind C SDK and Python SDK, and copy the resulting libraries to $SPLUNK_HOME (see detailed instructions in the README file).
The GeoASN lookup commands scales better, and can thus be used from within props.conf to provide automatic Country, Organization and ASN information for any search where an IP address is encountered.
Example Searches
If you have logs with a single IP address field:

| lookup ga ip  
| lookup ga ip AS the_name_of_your_ip_addr_field

If you have logs with two IP address fields:

| lookup geoasn src_ip dest_ip  
| lookup geoasn src_ip AS your_1st_field dest_ip AS your_2nd_field

Example props.conf
If you always want your searches to lookup the Country, Organization and ASN for IP addresses, you can configure props.conf to do this:
LOOKUP-geoasn = geoasn src_ip dest_ip
We typically use this for sourcetypes that have field extractions for src_ip and dest_ip, e.g., firewall logs.
It produces the following fields:

src_country : The Country as found in the Maxmind GeoCity database
dest_country : The Country as found in the Maxmind GeoCity database
src_asn : The AS number and Org as found in the Maxmind ASN database
src_as : The AS number, without the 'AS' prefix 
src_org : The Organization, without the AS number
dest_asn : The AS number and Org as found in the Maxmind ASN database
dest_as : The AS number, without the 'AS' prefix 
dest_org : The Organization, without the AS number

If the IP address being looked up is within the ranges defined in RFC 1918 (Private IP addresses), the Country and Organization is set to 'RFC1918', to make it easy to filter on Private IP addresses. AS number is set to 0.
If the address was not found in the database, and it is not an RFC 1918 address, the Country and Organization is set to 'Unknown', and the AS number is set to 0.
Performance
Benchmarking from Maxmind has shown that the native C libraries are capable of doing 400.000 IP address lookups per second, when memory caching is not used. The C implementation is capable of more than 1 million lookups/s when memory caching is used. GeoASN uses both the native C libraries and memory caching for maximum performance.
Another optimization is the lookup of the Country, Organization and ASN for both the src_ip and dest_ip in one single command. Instead of executing multiple lookup commands, we only execute once.
Typical Use Cases
All logs containing IP addresses will be easier to analyze if you, for each IP address, can tell which Country and Organization it belongs to. This is especially relevant for security analysis, where one can perform queries and reports to e.g., show all foreign communications.

This empowers security teams with a complete view of their external threat landscape and ensures their cybersecurity posture is robust, resilient, and able to counter emerging cyber threats. 
CYFIRMA’s core platform, DeCYFIR, gives security leaders a unified view into six threat pillars – attack surface discovery, vulnerability intelligence, brand intelligence, digital risk discovery, situational awareness, and cyber-intelligence. Based on analysis of threat indicators collected from the deep web, dark web, hacker forums and other closed communities, as well as CYFIRMA’s own research, attacks can be predicted using probability prediction models and analytics engines. By providing threat intelligence from the outside, CYFIRMA can share early warning information when signs of cyber-attacks are detected, enabling cyber teams to take rapid action to thwart attempts at intellectual property theft, ransomware attacks, and other malicious activities.
With UI App for Splunk, security operations team are equipped to search for malware, campaigns, threat actors and more, and create their personalized dashboards.
CYFRIMA’s DeCYFIR detects malware, viruses, malicious payload in the wild, hackers’ methods, techniques to infiltrate, infect and exfiltrate so security can detect an attack targeting them before it impacts their environment.  
Our unique ability to combine additional IOCs for a malware with active hacking campaign, cybercriminals groups and next-action planned by cybercriminals gives security operations team the ability to respond back to malware better and more effectively. 
Organization can take identified malwares in the wild, their behavioral pattern, and apply on EDR, XDR, NDR, perimeter security controls to proactively defend against unseen threats. 
DeCYFIR can identify newly created malware that is being used in cybercrime communities before it is seen by any cybersecurity controls.

OVERVIEW
QSentry is a consumable feed of anonymization and threat actor IP addresses sourced from the Deep and DarkWeb and Qintel’s proprietary research. The IPs in the feed are associated with infrastructure actively utilized or abused by cyber criminals, including VPN/Proxy services and IP addresses linked to the malicious infrastructure of criminal and nation-state actors. With this integration, users can fetch a daily list of newly compiled indicators from QSentry’s collections.
The Qintel QSentry Feed Add-on for Splunk allows you to ingest the Qintel QSentry feed into a key value store in Splunk so that your logs data can be enriched automatically or at search time.

Deployment
Single Server Deployment:
In a single server deployment, single instance of Splunk Enterprise functions as data collection node, indexer and search head. In such deployment, install the add-ons Proofpoint Email Security Add-On and Proofpoint TAP SIEM Modular Input. After that, install Proofpoint Email Security App For Splunk.
Distributed Deployment
In a distributed deployment, typically a combination of forwarders are deployed for data collection, separate indexer nodes for data injection and search heads for data visualization are deployed. We recommend installing our TA's on both Forwarder and Search heads and the App on the search head.

Source code |  Questions, Bugs or Suggestions | My Splunk apps


Getting started
This app is not ""visible"" in the Splunk UI app menu. After installing the app, follow this process:
1. Do a search of any data and switch to the visualisation tab
2. In the top left, in the visualisastion menu, select ""Region Chart viz""
3. Open the ""Format"" menu then select ""Help""
4. There will be a link to the in-app documentation, which includes working examples

Usage
This visualisation should work with any data that works with the Splunk built-in line chart. The first column (which is often ""_time"") will be the X-axis and subsequent columns will be rendered as lines (so they should be numeric values). A column with the specific name ""regions"" should be supplied which defines the regions to draw behind the chart.
This is how the data should look:

Regions are drawn per-column vertically, from bottom to top. Horizontal regions can be drawn by setting the same region value on multiple columns. See the examples below.
The format for the region field is comma-seperated key-value pairs and best explained with examples:









""regions"" field
Result


red
The most basic example that creates a region. A red column of data will be drawn from the bottom of the chart to the top of chart. Region colors can be specificed as valid HTML colours (RBG, Hex, named colours, etc..).


Out of hours=#ccccc
Create a named region in a grey color for the chart column. This name will be seen on the tooltip when hovering the chart.


green,1000,orange,1500,red
Create a green region from the bottom of the chart to 1000, an orange region from 1000 to 1500 and a red region from 1500 to the top of the chart.


,1000,Warning=orange,1500,Critical=red
Create a orange region from 1000 to 1500 and a red region from 1500 to the top of the chart.




Examples:
Charting ITSI Time-Based Policies
Especially useful for visualizing the adaptive thresholds that were set by ITSI (also works with ITSI static thresholds). Requires add-on Get ITSI Thresholds - custom command

Show business hours
Over a 24 hour chart, show the hours that are important.
... search ...
| timechart span=1h avg(series1) as avg
| eval hour = strftime(_time, ""%H"")
| eval regions = if(hour > 17 OR hour < 9,""Out of hours=#009DD9"","""") 
| fields - hour



Show static thresholds
Hardcoded simple static thresholds.
... search ... 
| timechart span=1m avg(series1) as avg
| eval regions = ""normal=#99D18B,5000,Warning=#FCB64E,7000,Error=#B50101""



Show that data might be incomplete
Add a gray region to highlight the area of the chart that is less than 15 minutes old. Can easily be adapted to show a maintinance window.
... search ... 
| timechart span=1h avg(series1) as avg
| eval regions = if(_time > (now() - 900),""Data still arriving=#aaaaaa"","""")



Show 2/3 standard deviations above/below the average, for same time last week
Calculate the historical average and standard deviation of the data. Then mark regions based on the standard deviations.
... search over 2 weeks of data ... 
| timechart span=1h avg(FIELD) as avg stdev(FIELD) as stddev 
| timewrap w series=short align=now 
| where _time > now() - 86400 
| eval regions = ""3 standard deviations below=#B50101,"" + tostring(avg_s1 - stddev_s1 * 3) + "",2 standard deviations below=#FCB64E,"" + tostring(avg_s1 - stddev_s1 * 2) + "",normal=#99D18B,"" + tostring(avg_s1 + stddev_s1 * 2) + "",2 standard deviations above=#FCB64E,"" + tostring(avg_s1 + stddev_s1 * 3) + "",3 standard deviations above=#B50101"" 
| table _time avg_s0 avg_s1 regions



Formatting options
There are two modes of rendering the lines when there are multiple series of data. ""Lighter/Dashed"" is best suited when the data series are historical trend lines. E.g. Comparing CPU performance this week against last week and the week before. ""Coloured"" is best suited when the data series are peers. E.g. The average CPU of three servers in a cluster.


There are some text overlays that can be enabled. Note that these overlays are only for the primary data series.

SML (Security Management with Logging) is a comprehensive security software suite for realizing security countermeasures.
PC operation logs (such as e-mail, application usage, network usage, file operations, etc) are logged by SML. SML also has various additional functions, such as data loss prevention via application whitelisting, external device restriction controls, and PC time usage controls, business process evaluation via file distribution tracking and usage analysis, productivity improvements via application and web filter controls, as well as malware infection route back/forward tracing.
""Security App for SML"" is a new security solution that joins the PC logging functions of SML and the analytics base of Splunk, leveraging their respective strengths to reduce the risk of information leakage. By importing SML logs to Splunk, a convenient dashboard and search features can be used easily.
The main dashboard menu consists of;
1. External outbound e-mail counts, classification, destination domain list, etc.
2. Files written to external storage devices, by filename or PC ranking, etc.
3. Blocked application process list, by process name or PC ranking, etc.
4. Internet file uploads, by time or filename or file count, etc.
5. Miscellaneous
Installation Summary
A) Install ""Security App for SML"" in your Splunk server.
B) Install the ""Splunk import tool"" in your SML main server.
C) Perform an import setup from the configuration screen of your Splunk server.

Overview


The UMFA App for Splunk is a forwarder monitoring app bringing together and enhancing multiple 
disjointed monitoring functions already in use in Splunk. This monitoring tool will provide details on 
any system that has sent an event to your indexer(s) including reporting on full instances of Splunk, 
Universal Forwarders, Heavy Forwarders, and even independent Stream forwarders. It also brings deployment
server information to your forwarder monitoring. At the click of a button see volume and connection stats,
find out exactly which apps and server classes are deployed to a forwarder, or see if there are inactive 
apps or server classes that may be cleaned from a deployment server. This app aims to be a one stop shop
for your forwarder monitoring needs.
Support
Questions or feature requests may be sent to Madison.Moss@jhuapl.edu and support may depend on availability. 
Support is to only include bug fixes in the case any feature or process does not work as described within
documentation. In this case I will work to resolve the issue and update the app with the fix in place. Feature 
requests may be sent but are not guaranteed in any future releases of the app.
Installation
The UFMA App for Splunk is an app that provides searches and visualizations and should be installed on a 
search head. The app will work in a standalone, distributed, or clustered environment. On a standalone 
search head place the app in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ and refresh Splunk
(https://<your_searchHead>:8000/en-US/debug/refresh)  or install from file directly from the web GUI. In 
a clustered environement place the app in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/shcluster/apps/ on the Deployer and apply 
the cluster bundle to the search head cluster (splunk apply shcluster-bundle -target <shcluster-captain>:8089).
After installation it is recommended to manually run ""Rebuild Asset Table"" under All Configurations to get
an initial table of forwarders.
Requirements
Users of UFMA must have permissions to view _internal index and access to REST capabilities. The recommended
role is ""admin"". In order to enrich your data with deployment server information your deployment server(s)
must be added as search peers on the search head where UFMA will be run. This is not required for forwarder
alerting but for functionality is recommended. Follow Splunk recommended requirements for OS and hardware
guidelines.
App Components


Many components in the app have customized drilldowns for filtering and to provide quicker deep dives.
Forwarders - Forwarder Summary
The Forwarder Summary dashboard is a complete overview of everything forwarding in your environment. It
will provide everything from a total count of forwarders to event stats and sending volume for individual
forwarders for the time range selected. This view may help you identify your most active forwarders, if your 
forwarders are load balancing properly, or if a once active forwarder is not active at all.  It will also tell 
you exactly where your forwarders are checking into if you use multiple deployment servers. Please note any 
deployment server information will appear as ""N/A"" if a forwarder is not configured to use a deployment server 
or the deployment server it is checking into has not been added as a search peer. Other information may appear 
as ""N/A"" if no data has been received for the forwarder within the selected time range.
Forwarders - Forwarder Detail
The Forwarder Detail dashboard is a deep dive into a single forwarder in your environment. It will provide
forwarding statistics for a forwarder for the selected time range as well as provide deployment server details
as to exactly which apps and server classes are on the forwarder. Please note, if an app has been deployed
directly to the forwarder and not through a deployment server the app will not appear in this information. It
also provides and overview of which sourcetypes the forwarder has sent over the selected time range. New in 2.0.0
there is now a hidden panel that will appear if _introspection has been enabled for the selected forwarder. This
will provide a deep dive into how Splunk is utilizing system resources and allow you to optimize forwarder
performance. Look for things like if entire CPU cores are consumed by Splunk and see whether those resources are
going to scripted input, registry monitoring (baselining can be CPU intensive), or other Splunk actions. Details
on how to enable this additional monitoring are available on the Forwarder Resource Usage Dashboard.
Forwarders - Forwarder Resource Usage
The Forwarder Resource Usage dashboard adds even more granularity into monitoring your forwarders. It dives into
resource usage of different Splunk components and helps enable you to look for anomalous systems that Splunk
may be consuming more CPU or RAM on for whatever reason. Drill down into different systems and it will direct you
to the Forwarder Detail dashboard for more details on a specific system.
Deployment Server Summary
The Deployment Server Summary provides details on apps, server classes, and every forwarder checking into your
deployment server(s). See what apps or server classes are deployed and which ones are inactive and might be able
to be cleaned from the deployment server. Also quickly be able to tell which forwarder and app or server class 
is deployed to.
All Configurations - Rebuild Asset Table
Tired of having to completely rebuild your asset table in the Monitoring Console and losing missing forwarders
that may still be important? Now you have the option to selectively remove missing forwarders from your asset
table while retaining your alerting for other missing forwarders. Select the default ""All"" to completely rebuild
the table or use the multiselect to pick missing forwarders to remove from the current list. Please note if a
selected forwarder has recorded activity within that timerange selected it will still appear in the table. Also,
the total forwarder number on this page may differ from that on the Forwarders - Forwarder Summary page as this
page accounts for all GUIDs which may have duplicate hostnames. The Forwarders - Forwarder Summary page will dedup
over hostname only taking the latest/active GUID.
All Configurations - Reports
A collection of all saved reports for UFMA. By default there is a single scheduled search, ""UFMA - Complete Asset 
List"",set to run every 5 minutes to update the forwarder asset table. You may adjust these settings to your 
environment's needs. Larger environments may want to reduce the frequency in which the report runs.
All Configurations - Alerts
A collection of all alerts for UFMA. By default there is a single alert, ""UFMA - ALERT - Missing Forwarders"",
checking for any missing forwarder set to run every 5 minutes. The alert action is currently set to list in 
triggered alerts. You may update this to your needs such as email alerting. This alert corresponds with the 
scheduled report ""UFMA - Complete Asset List"". A forwarder is considered missing if it has not connected to an 
indexer in the last 15 minutes. Using this combination of search and alert you should know if a forwarder is 
offline in about 20 minutes or less from the time the forwarder stops connecting. You may adjust this time by 
changing the ""900"" seconds used in ""UFMA - Complete Asset List"" to alter the 15 minute missing classification and 
may change the run frequency of the scheduled search and alert to reduce or increase the additional up to 5 minutes 
of lag in reporting. Please do take into account the ""UFMA - Complete Asset List"" search can be an intensive search 
and may need to be adjusted to work well depending the size of your environment. You may customize your forwarder 
alerting further by filtering what you want to report on. Some examples below will help layout how to exclude 
specific forwarder hostnames or forwarders checking into specific deployment servers from alerting on missing
forwarders. You may disable the default alert and create your own or modify the existing alert to insert your
environment details.
Custom Alert - Exclude Deployment Server(s)
| inputlookup ufma_asset_list 
| search status=""missing"" deployment_server!=<deploymentServer> ... deployment_server!=<deploymentServerN>
| eval last_connected = strftime(last_connected, ""%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S %z"") 
| fields hostname forwarder_type version last_connected deployment_server
Custom Alert - Exclude Hostname(s)
| inputlookup ufma_asset_list
| search status=""missing"" hostname!=<hostname1> hostname!=<hostname2> ... hostname!=<hostnameN>
| eval last_connected = strftime(last_connected, ""%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S %z"")
| fields hostname forwarder_type version last_connected deployment_server
All Configurations - Dashboards
A collection of all views contained in UFMA
Search
A basic search function to use within the UFMA context
Macros
If you look at the macros contained within UFMA you will see a variety of macros used to drive the app. One macro
called ""exclude_hosts"" contains some dummy hosts by default but can be editted if you would like to exclude certain
hosts from being populated in your asset table. A use case for this may be where certain VMs are continuously spun
up and destroyed. Rather than having a quickly growing asset table that needs to be rebuilt to remove these system
they can be called out in this macro to exclude them from the start.",Version 2.0.3,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/639c61f4-372a-11ec-802c-6a80fa660673.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance, Utilities",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,"2,500",0,splunk,5,5,Madison Moss,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/mdsnmss,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

RRD database is used by MRTG, collectd, ntop, ganglia, munin and many other monitoring tools to record time series data.
With this add-on, you can use these tools to collect performance data from many nodes, and use Splunk for searching and graphing the collected data.
Customization
Some parameters can be changed by directly editing the script.
See the head part of the scirpt:  
FETCH_INTERVAL = 600 # in seconds
STEP = 10
CONSOLIDATION_FUNCTION = ""AVERAGE""
TIME_FORMAT = ""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S""

FETCH_INTERVAL is the interval you run this script. This value must be the same as the value of ""interval"" in your input.conf.
STEP is from RRD files. The value to be set varies depending on the creators of the RRD files. To know a value for your RRD file, you can use the following command:  
rrdtool info PATH_TO_YOUR_RRD_FILE

This command prints information of your RRD file.  
filename = ""cpu-system.rrd""
rrd_version = ""0003""
step = 10
last_update = 1298883682
header_size = 3504
...

Look at the line that starts with ""step ="". That is the value to be set to STEP. In this case, it is ""10"".
CONSOLIDATION_FUNCTION is the function that is applied to values recorded in RRD files to calculate the final input to the script.
TIME_FORMAT controls how the script formats timestamps. Python's strftime-style format string can be used.",Version 1.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/image/default_icon.png,Utilities,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,775,0,splunk,0,0,Kohei Takeda,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/takeda,"Products: Splunk Enterprise

This is an app powered by the Splunk Add-on Builder.
OVERVIEW
GreyNoise Splunk app provides multiple dashboards to effectively analyse and visualize the contextual and statistical data provided by GreyNoise. It also includes custom commands and alert actions which can be used along with Splunk searches to leverage GreyNoise APIs for custom use cases. It periodically scans the Splunk deployment through saved search to indicate the noise and RIOT IPs in the complete Splunk deployment. Along with this, the workflow action provided can be used to obtain live context information of any CIM compliant field containing an IP address.

TOPOLOGY AND SETTING UP SPLUNK ENVIRONMENT
Standalone Mode

Install GreyNoise App for Splunk. See INSTALLATION section for more details.
Configure the API key and log level. See CONFIGURATION section for details.

Search Head Cluster

In case of Search Head Clustering, make sure that the GreyNoise Setup and Scan Deployment is configured on only single search head. In such cases, the configuration will not be visible on other search heads. In case if user wants to configure the Logging (default is INFO), user can configure individually on every search head. This is recommended.
If user wants to replicate the configuration settings, follow these steps:
On search head deployer, extract the app at $SPLUNK_HOME$/etc/shcluster/apps.
Create stanza shclustering at path $SPLUNK_HOME$/etc/shcluster/apps/SA-GreyNoise/local/server.conf and add following information to the stanza: conf_replication_include.app_greynoise_settings = true
Push the bundle to search head.
Configure the API key and log level. See CONFIGURATION section for details. Following these steps will replicate the configuration on all search heads.

Time to live: Time period (in hours) to configure the cache’s time to live. Responses whose age is greater than the TTL, will be removed from the cache by a savedsearch which will run every hour.
Purge Cache: Checkbox to purge the cache of all responses.



Note: Configuration can only be done by admin but other custom commands can be used by admin and the users with list_storage_passwords capability.
CUSTOM COMMANDS
The following commands are included as a part of the app:

gnip
Search format: | gnip ip=""<ip_address>""
Purpose: Retrieves context information for a given IP address from the GreyNoise.


gnquick
Search format: | gnquick ip=""<ip_address1>,<ip_address2>,<ip_address3>"" [OR] SPL_QUERY | gnquick ip_field=""<ip_field>""
Purpose: Retrieve the noise and RIOT status of all the IP addresses as separate events [OR] Retrieve the noise and RIOT status for all the given IPs returned by the SPL_QUERY for specified ip_field. 


gnquery
Search format: | gnquery query=""<GNQL_query>"" result_size=""<result_size>""

Search format: | gnstats query=""<GNQL_query>"" count=""<stats_count>""
Purpose: Fetch the aggregate statistics for the top organizations, actors, tags, ASNs, countries, classifications, and operating systems of all the results for a given GNQL query. count denotes the number of stats to be retrieved. count is an optional parameter.


gnmulti
Search format: SPL_QUERY | gnmulti ip_field=""<ip_field>""
Purpose: Retrieves noise and RIOT status of the IP addresses represented by ip_field parameter present in each event, and adds the noise and RIOT information to each event.


gncontext
Search format: | gncontext ip=""<ip_address>""
Purpose: Retrieves context information for a given IP address from the GreyNoise.


gnfilter
Search format: SPL_QUERY | gnfilter ip_field=""<ip_field>"" noise_events=""<true/false>""
Purpose: Filter Splunk events returned by given SPL_QUERY based on the noise status of IP address present in ip_field of the events. noise_events is an optional parameter with default value true. So, it will return events with noise IP addresses by default. 


gnenrich
Search format: SPL_QUERY | gnenrich ip_field=""<ip_field>""
Purpose: Enrich the Splunk events returned by given SPL_QUERY with the context information of IP address represented by ip_field in Splunk Search.


gnriot

Note : While executing the transforming commands from Splunk search UI, ensure that the event count passed to the command is less than 50,000, as per standard limits of Splunk. If the event count is higher than this number, user can create a Saved Search and pass higher number of Splunk statistical data to the command. 
ALERT ACTIONS
The following alert actions are included as a part of the app:

GreyNoise Quick Check: Returns noise information from GreyNoise for given IP addresses.
GreyNoise Context Check: Returns context information from GreyNoise for given IP Addresses.

These alert actions can be used independently as well as with Splunk Enterprise Security in the form of Adaptive Response Actions. Results from these actions can be found in index=main sourcetype=greynoise
The two sources for these adaptive response actions are: source=greynoise_context and source=greynoise_quick.
Usage with Splunk Enterprise Security:
 - These actions can be executed from Incident Review, and results can be accessed directly by refreshing the ""Adaptive Responses"" panel and clicking the appropriate link.
WORKFLOW ACTION
Identify Noise workflow action is enabled for all the CIM compliant IP fields which can be used to fetch the context information for the corresponding IP addresses.
DASHBOARDS
This app contains the following three dashboards:

Overview: This dashboard represents an overall visualization of the statistics provided by GreyNoise platform as well as the statistics of the noise IPs and the RIOT IPs in the Splunk deployment.
Noise IP Addresses: This dashboard displays all the IP addresses along with their noise and RIOT status scanned by GreyNoise through Scan Deployment feature in the current Splunk deployment. This dashboard will be populated when Scan Deployment feature is enabled.
Live Investigation: This dashboard can be used to obtain context information fetched dynamically from the GreyNoise platform based on the form input provided.

Note : In Overview, Percentage of RIOT IPs is calculated only for the new IPs scanned after the App was upgraded. Also in the Noise IP Addresses, the RIOT status won't be shown for those IPs that were scanned before the App was upgraded. 
SAVED SEARCHES
This app contains the following saved searches, which are used for populating data in the dashboard:

greynoise_scan_deployment_once: Used to populate gn_scan_deployment_ip_lookup lookup and is triggered after configuring Scan Deployment feature.
greynoise_scan_deployment: Used to populate gn_scan_deployment_ip_lookup lookup and is triggered at an interval of 60 minutes and scans the data of previous 70 minutes.
greynoise_overview_once: Used to populate gn_overview_lookup lookup, and is triggered after configuring the API key.
greynoise_overview: Used to populate gn_overview_lookup lookup, and is triggered at an interval of 6 hours.
greynoise_cache_maintenance: Used to remove those responses whose TTL is expired from the Cache for all the custom commands, and is triggered at an interval of 60 minutes.

Note : greynoise_scan_deployment_once and greynoise_scan_deployment savedsearches are used for scanning the data indexed in Splunk. So, in case when these saved searches are skipped, the data indexed during that interval will not be scanned for noise and RIOT status. 
UNINSTALL APP
To uninstall app, user can follow below steps: 

SSH to the Splunk instance 
Go to folder apps($SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps) 
Remove the SA-GreyNoise folder from apps directory 
Restart Splunk

TROUBLESHOOTING

Alerts fail to write to index=main sourcetype=greynoise and Enterprise Security is not installed.
Ensure that the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) Add-on has been installed. No configuration of this add-on is necessary.


Data in Overview dashboard is not being populated.
Ensure that greynoise_overview Saved Search is enabled.


Data in Noise IP Address dashboard is not being populated.
Ensure that the Scan Deployment feature is enabled. The data must populate in an hour. In case the issue still persists, make sure that greynoise_scan_deployment Saved Search is enabled.
Ensure that the KV store is enabled. 


Custom commands are not being executed and failing with unknown exception. For example: Exception occurred while fetching the context of the ip=<ip>. See greynoise_main.log for more details.
Ensure that the user executing custom command has list_storage_passwords capability. 


Noise and RIOT information of some of the IP addresses is being missed in Noise IP Address dashboard.
Ensure that the corresponding index and fields are entered as per the format while enabling Scan Deployment feature.


Custom commands exited unexpectedly.
Ensure that maximum 50000 results are passed to the custom command while executing search from the Splunk Search Interface, as Splunk supports maximum 50000 results. For processing more results, Saved Searches can be used.


Scan Deployment feature is not working as expected.
Check for the messages in Splunk UI. If message like KV store not in ready state. Make sure it is enabled. is shown, ensure that KV store is enabled.
Check in splunkd.log for messages like External command based lookup 'gn_scan_deployment_ip_lookup' is disabled because KV Store is disabled.
If such messages show up, then ensure that the KV store is enabled.


In search head clustering, configurations are visible on only one search head and not on others.
This is the expected behaviour when replication is not enabled. The functionalities will work on all the search heads.


If any of the transforming command is not working as expected, ensure that the events have IP field extracted which is passed to ip_field parameter in the transforming command.
Getting following error while using transforming custom commands.
Events might not be returned in sub-second order due to search memory limits.
Create a file 'limits.conf' in the following directory $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/SA-GreyNoise/local.
Add the following stanza in the file:
[search]
  max_rawsize_perchunk = 500000000

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4633,2022-01-10,08:21:57 AM,Snort 3 JSON Alerts,,"Dec. 24, 2020","Technology Add-On for Snort3 Json Alerts
Overview
The Snort 3 for JSON Alerts Technology Add-On (TA_Snort3_json) is a Splunk Technology Add-On for ingesting and normalizing alert and OpenAppID data created by a Snort 3.
This Technology Add-On (TA) normalizes Snort 3 alerts that are written with Snort 3s alert_json plugin to make it compliant with the ""Network Intrusion Detection"" model of the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM).  This TA also injests OpenAppID data from Snort 3 from the appid_listener plugin.
The public repository for this TA is: https://github.com/NDietrich/Splunk-Snort3-TA.
IMPORTANT
Snort 3 is currently a Beta product. It should not be used in production or mission-cricical environments, and is available primarily for testing purposes.  Because of this, it is possible that future modifications to Snort 3 will break this plugin. This plugin has been released before the final version of Snort 3 has been finalized to solicit feedback, including feature requests and bug reports.
Installation & Configuration
More detailed configuration instructions for Snort 3 can be found at https://SublimeRobots.com/.
Configuring Snort 3 json_alerts Output Plugin
Ensure that you have installed Snort 3, and it is correctly outputting alerts in JSON format.  Please see https://snort.org/documents for installation guides (make sure to install Snort 3 instead of Snort 2).  If you are unsure what platform to install Snort on (Linux, Windows, BSD), choose the platform you are most comfortable using.  I have authored some in-depth installation guides for Ubuntu, available on Snort's website, or alternately available at https://SublimeRobots.com/.
In your json output files, make sure that 'seconds' field is the very first field output for each alert.  The alert_json plugin is configured in the snort.lua file.  In the example below, you can see the following output options:

fields:  The 'seconds' field is the first field listed (and thus the first field in the output).  The example below outputs every possible field.  You can probably remove some of these fields after testing to determine if they are necessary, such as the vlan or mpls fields.
file:  We are outputting to a file (the alert_json.txt file).
limit: Each json file will be 100 MB before it rolls over to a new file (named alert_json.txt.epochtime).

--- in your snort.lua file
alert_json =
{
    fields = 'seconds timestamp action class b64_data dir dst_addr dst_ap dst_port eth_dst eth_len eth_src eth_type gid icmp_code icmp_id icmp_seq icmp_type iface ip_id ip_len msg mpls pkt_gen pkt_len pkt_num priority proto rev rule service sid src_addr src_ap src_port target tcp_ack tcp_flags tcp_len tcp_seq tcp_win tos ttl udp_len vlan',
    file = true,
    limit = 100,
}
Configuring Snort 3 appid_listener Output Plugin
Make sure to install the latest OpenAppID detector package and the Snort Extras package. Add the following to your snort.lua file:
appid =
{
    app_detector_dir = '/usr/local/lib',
}

appid_listener =
{
    json_logging = true,
    file = ""/var/log/snort/appid-output.log"",
}
Installation of this TA
This TA should be installed on all servers in your infrastructure, but most important it must be installed and configured on the server where the log files are ingested.  Failure to also install this plugin on Indexers, Heavy forwarders, or Search Heads may result in data that is not normalized correctly.
Configuration of this TA
The TA must be configured wherever Snort 3 JSON logs are collected (usually on your UF).  You do not need to modify this TA on any Splunk servers that are not actively collecting logs (you don't need to modify this TA on your indexers or search heads, it just needs to be installed for CIM normalization).
On the Splunk servers where you will be collecting log files, you must modify this plugin to specify the location of your Snort 3 JSON files.  This can be accomplished by creating a new 'inputs.conf' file in the TA_Snort3_json application 'local' folder. Do not modify the ./default/inputs.conf file directly.
Create a new ./local/inputs.conf file in the TA_Snort3_json folder. This file should be located at:
  $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA_Snort3_json/local/inputs.conf
For alert data: you must place a 'monitor' stanza in the local inputs.conf file that contains the path to the folder containing the Snort 3 alert JSON files. For example, if your files are located in /var/log/snort (a common location), your ./local/inputs.conf file should contain the following two lines:
[monitor:///var/log/snort/*alert_json.txt*]
sourcetype = snort3:alert:json

These lines are required, and will allow Splunk to index all Snort 3 json alert log files in the /var/log/snort folder (and sub-folders).
For OpenAppID data, add the following section to the same ./local/inputs.conf:
[monitor:///var/log/snort/*appid-output.log*]
sourcetype = snort3:openappid:json

Restart Splunk on the server where you created this inputs.conf file. Splunk will index existing Snort 3 json files in this folder and sub-folders.
Optional Input Configuration Options
The following settings for you local inputs.conf file are available if you have specific needs.  For example, if you want to save these events to a different index, add the following line specifying the index name:
# in your $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA_Snort3_json/local/inputs.conf file
[monitor:///var/log/snort/*alert_json.txt*]
sourcetype = snort3:alert:json
index = another-index-name

If you do not want to monitor sub-folders of the initial folder (say if you're rotating logs to a sub-folder), you can disable recursion:
# in your $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA_Snort3_json/local/inputs.conf file
[monitor:///var/log/snort/*alert_json.txt*]
sourcetype = snort3:alert:json
recursive = false

Searching Snort 3 Alerts:
Once your indexer is collecting Snort 3 events, you can search for them simply by searching by sourcetype:
search sourcetype=snort3:alert:json

you can also use the following tags (this could return normalized events from other NIDS's if you have them):
search tag=ids AND tag=attack

Searching OpenAppID data
Once your indexer is collecting Snort 3 OpenAppID data, you can search for them simply by searching by sourcetype:
search sourcetype=snort3:openappid:json

Recommended supporting Add-ons:

CyberChef:  https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5348/
This TA provides the ability to convert the packet data (stored in the b64_data field) into readable info.  in the example below, the 2nd line takes advantage of this new TA to display the URI data from web reqests:

    sourcetype=snort3:alert:json b64_data = * dst_port=80
    | cyberchef infield = b64_data outfield=decrypted operation=""FromBase64"" 
    | table gid, sid, priority, class, msg, decrypted
This becomes very helpful when looking at the contents of alerts containing URIs, SMTP and FTP data, web URI's, and shell code.
Additional Notes:
The b64_data data field is responsible for most of the data created by the plugin. If you are worried about Splunk license usage, and don't need the packet data, then you can omit this field in the alert_json Snort configuration file snort.lua.  In my testing, I have found that the b64_data field increases the event size by 50%.

The Splunk App for NSS Labs CAWS enables consumers of the CAWS API to simply injest CAWS threat and device efficacy into Splunk and view this data using helpful charts and KPI panels.  Users can also integrate CAWS organization statistics and KPIs into custom dashboards using various saved searches.
Features
1. NSS Labs' CAWS API Data Modular Input
Allows Splunk users to receive threat details and device efficacy notifications from NSS Labs' Cyber Advanced Warning System.  Event sourcetypes are caws:threat and caws:bypass.
Notes About Modular Input Data

sourcetype=caws:threat - Results provide details about threats found in the wild.  Please see the full documentation for information on how fields are aliased to the Splunk CIM Malware_Attack model.
sourcetype=caws:bypass - Results provide basic details about threats that bypassed a security product in a CAWS Profile.  Data can be joined to caws:threat events using the NSSId field.

2. CAWS Metrics/KPI Saved Searches
Allows the querying of an organization’s statistics/KPIs in Splunk using custom search commands and saved searches.  These saved searches are scoped to the application by default.  Please see Searches, reports, and alerts under the Settings menu or the full documentation for more detail.
3. Dashboards
Splunk for CAWS includes several simple dashboards to provide users with examples of the data provided by the modular inputs, custom search commands, and saved searches.
Requirements
The application requires access to the CAWS API with integration features enabled.
Gettting Started
After installing the app, it can be configured using its setup page.  This will configure a default NSS Labs’ CAWS API Data modular input and securely store CAWS API credentials to allow the included custom search commands to authenticate against the CAWS API.
Note:  If users chose to manually configure the NSS Labs’ CAWS API Data modular input, the password will be encrypted and masked automatically when events are streamed for the first time.

Differentiators in the market


The primary USP of our solution is that:
a. It can analyse and visualize all the error data from all apps installed on the device
     AND
b. It can do this for all the devices that have our APK installed


Unlike the competitor tools which target Android App Developers/Companies, The target customers here are OEMs & Operators. It is not restricted to log collection for failures from 1 particular app or one particular user. 


Analytics on Collective Data from many devices (multiple Android Versions, Device Models, and releases) is potentially able to give a bigger insight, than accessing individual app's performance provided by competitor tools.


Big Data techniques of Data Mining and Searching are not applied to Android Log data till now by any open source or commercial tool at device level. 


Key Components
These are the Device and Server side components required for the Actual / Wi-Fi Router based deployment of this Solution:
• INTELLIPRETER - Splunk Enterprise SDK based Application
• Splunk Forwarder
• ACRA STORAGE - Log & Report Collection Server
• Crash Reporter - Android APK to be installed on Devices for tapping the Error Instance, Data Collection and Upload

***Installation:
Install Splunk and these Splunk app prereqs:
dnslookup
Google Maps
TA-peoplesoft_architecture
windows * if you have Windows PeopleSoft servers
Splunk_TA_nix * if you have Linux/UNIX PeopleSoft servers

Install the PeopleSoft app on the Splunk Server(s)
Install Technology Assistant apps appropriate to your environment included in the appserver/addons directory:
TA-peoplesoft_linux_app
TA-peoplesoft_linux_oracle
TA-peoplesoft_linux_weblogic
TA-peoplesoft_windows_app
TA-peoplesoft_windows_psched

Install the Appropriate apps on the PeopleSoft servers.
Copy the default inputs.conf from default to local.  Fix the paths and enable the inputs in the local copy of inputs.conf.
Including either windows or Splunk_TA_nix, any TA apps that apply to the server's platform.  (Consider implementing deployment server.)
Notes about specific platforms:
I only made TA apps for platforms I use.  Hopefully you can adapt what is there to your platform.  If you do, let me know what you did and we can roll it into future releases.
Linux Application Server:
In TA-peoplesoft_linux_app/bin/psapp.sh edit your PS_HOME and PS_CFG_HOME.
You may need to add stanzas in inputs.conf if you have multiple application server domains installed.
Linux Oracle server:
Copy the default/inputs.conf to local.  Fix the paths and enable the inputs.  Copy stanzas as needed if you have multiple instances per server.
Linux Weblogic Server:
NOTE: there is a Splunk Weblogic app and I'm not using it.

In TA-peoplesoft_linux_weblogic/bin/psweb.sh edit your PIA_HOME.
In the weblogic console enable the PIA_access.log and set the Log File Buffer to 0 (If you don't do this data won't roll to Splunk until the buffer fills.)
You may need to add stanzas in inputs.conf if you have multiple weblogic domains installed.
Windows Application and Process Scheduler servers:
On your Windows PeopleSoft servers, enable the inputs in perfmon.conf, and change the index to windows, or change the windows_index search macro.
On Windows Application Servers and Process Scheduler servers I've had to run the SplunkForwarder service as the same domain user that runs the PeopleSoft services.
You may need to add stanzas in inputs.conf if you have multiple application server domains installed.  I've seen memory issues when I tried to replace the  name with a wildcard.
Uses Gnu sed.
Same with Windows process schedulers:
You may need to add stanzas in inputs.conf if you have multiple process scheduler domains installed.  I've seen memory issues when I tried to replace the  name with a wildcard.
Uses Gnu sed.
Configure search macros:
Configure the servers selection macros listed below to select the hosts that handle the function listed below.  For instance, if your production database servers are proddb1, proddb2, and proddb3, set ps_prd_db_servers to a search string that selects them such as:
        host=proddb1 OR host=proddb2 OR host=proddb3

*Configure these macros:
ps_dev_app_servers
ps_dev_db_servers
ps_dev_web_servers
ps_prd_app_servers
ps_prd_db_servers
ps_prd_web_servers
ps_dev_psched_servers
ps_prd_psched_servers

If you are using different indexes than the defaults, edit these search macros:
linux_index
windows_index
ps_app_index
ps_db_index
ps_psched_index
ps_web_index

Configure the local IP lookup (optional):
If you want your private IP addresses to show up at your location on the maps, you can modify the peoplesoft.csv lookup, or add your own file and modify the ps_local_ips search macro.  If you leave it the default, all private IPs show up in Pleasanton, CA.",Version 1.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/image/default_icon.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/,556,0,splunk,3,1,Erich Donze,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/edonze,"Products: Splunk Enterprise

What does the app do?
The Departures Board Viz is a single value animated visualization in the style of airport departure boards. Drop it into your own dashboards to display places, users, timestamps or any other important information in an eye catching and fun way
Who is this app for?

This app is for anyone who wants a single-value panel display for both text and numerical search results.

How does the app work?

This app provides a visualization that you can use in your own apps and dashboards.
To use it in your dashboards, simply install the app, and create a search that provides the following fields: _time, name, value, status

Usecases for the Performance Analysis Visualization:

Displaying current server names, locations, or user names
Flipping between a list of items
Displaying numbers or time fields - eg incident ticket numbers, timestamps for events

The following fields can be used in the search:

(field 1): required: The first field will be used to display text on the visualization.
(field 2): optional: An ID associated to the text. Will be used for the ID token each time the visualization changes.
(remaining fields): optional: all remaining fields will be ingnored.

Example Search
| makeresults count=10 | streamstats count as id| eval text=case(id==1,""Canberra"",id==2,""Wellington"",id==3,""Washington"",id==4,""London"",id==5,""Tokyo"",id==6,""Ottawa"",id==7,""New Delhi"",id==8,""Beijing"",id==9,""Paris"",id==10,""Berlin"") | table text, id
A sample data set is included with the app:
| inputlookup departures-board-cities-lookup.csv
Tokens
Two tokens are generated by the visualization - one for the text which is displayed, and one for an associated id field. By default the tokens are called:

dbv_term: The currently displayed value
dbv_id: An ID field to assist further searches

Token names are customizable.
Limits
The visualization is bound by the following limits:
- Total results: 100
- Total characters: 50
- Auto Refresh duration: 1s to 999s (anything outside these bounds will cause it to default to 5s)
Possible Issues

No issues have been raised. If you have a bug report, please contact daniel@spavin.net

DECRYPT is a set of Splunk commands which provide encryption and
   decryption routines commonly used in malware communication and data
   exfiltration.
Installation
DECRYPT is a standard Splunk App and requires no special configuration.
Usage
DECRYPT is implemented as a single search command which exposes a number of data manipulation functions. It takes the required field to manipulate and then one or more functions as arguments.
Usage: decrypt [field=<name>] FUNCTIONS...
The following example will transform the sourcetype field into its hex representation:
... | decrypt field=sourcetype hex() emit('sourcetype')
Note: Fields must be output via the emit function. The input field is not modified in place.
If the emit function is not mentioned, an emit('decrypted') is automatically added so the data is output
Arguments
field
The field argument specifies the Splunk field to use as input.
... | decrypt field=""hostname"" ...
If no field argument is passed then _raw will be used by default.
If a field argument is passed and the field does not exist in the current record being processed, no error or warning will be given.
FUNCTIONS
Each function passed as an argument will be executed in order, with the output of the previous function provided as input to the next.
... | decrypt field=hostname b64 xor('s\x65cr\x65t') hex emit('decrypted')
The above example can be explained as:
Pass the value of the hostname field to b64 as input
Pass the output of b64 to xor as input with the argument 's\x65cr\x65t'
Pass the output of xor to hex as input
Pass the output of hex to emit with the argument 'decrypted'
Functions
btoa()
Encodes input to a Base64 string.
b64(), atob()
Decodes a Base64 encoded string.
b32()
Decodes a Base32 encoded string.
rotx(count)
Implements Caesarian shift. The count argument specifies the amount to shift and must be an integer.
rol(count)
Implements rotate-on-left to each character within the string using an 8 bit boundary. The count argument specifies the amount to rotate and must be an integer.
ror(count)
Implements rotate-on-right to each character within the string using an 8 bit boundary. The count argument specifies the amount to rotate and must be an integer.
xor(key)
Implements basic XOR cipher against the field with the supplied key. The key can be provided as a string or integer.
rc4(key)
Implements the RC4 cipher against the field with the supplied key. The key provided must be a string.
hex()
Transforms input into its hexadecimal representation.
unhex()
Transforms hexadecimal input into its byte form.
save(name)
Saves the current state to memory as name.
load(name)
Recalls the previously saved state name from memory.
ascii()
Transforms input into ASCII output. Non-printable characters will be replaced with a period.
emit(name)
Outputs the current state as UTF-8 to the field name.
substr(offset, count)
Returns a substring of the input, starting at the index offset with the number of characters count.
Function Arguments
Strings
Strings can be specified by encapsulating values in apostrophes (single quote). Strings accept Pythonic escape sequences, so hexadecimal and octal values can be specified with \xhh and \ooo respectively.
'This is a valid string'
'This is also \x61 valid string.'
Quotation marks (double quotes) cannot be used.
""This is not a valid string""
Integers
Integers can be specified numerically or as hexadecimal representations by prefixing values with a 0x.
The value 256 could be passed as is or as its hexadecimal representation 0x100.
Field References
The value of Splunk fields can be used in function parameters by passing the field name as an argument. All referenced fields must be complete words unbroken by whitespace.
... | decrypt field=_raw xor(sourcetype) ...
The above example demonstrates passing the sourcetype field as the key to the xor function.
Fields saved using the save command can also be referenced.
... | decrypt field=_raw substr(0,1) save('1byte') substr(1, 4096) xor(1byte) ...
Style
Functions which take no arguments do not need parenthesis in order for syntax checking to pass. The following examples will pass syntax checks and execute the same.
... | decrypt field=_raw b64 hex unhex
... | decrypt field=_raw b64() hex() unhex()
... | decrypt field=_raw b64() hex unhex
New lines can be used to break up command sequences for easier readability.
... | decrypt field=_raw
b64
hex
unhex
Recipes
XOR
... | decrypt field=data xor('secret') emit('result')
ROT13 cipher
... | decrypt field=data rotx(13) emit('result')
Base64 decode, XOR
... | decrypt field=data b64 xor('secret') emit('result')
Base64 decode, XOR with first byte
... | decrypt field=data
b64
save('bin')
substr(0, 1) emit('key')
load('bin')
substr(1, 9999) xor(key) emit('result')
Brute force RC4
... | decrypt field=data

The intent of this app is to provide a simple interface for sharing knowledge in Splunk through editing a simple CSV file, the app can generate a set of standard dashboards and navigation. 
Description and Use-cases
Have you ever wanted a centralized location to direct users to so they can find what they need? Example: What special index do we store our firewall data? This app provides a simple interface for both administrators (to catalog data locations) and users (to find the data they need).
Depending on how Splunk is managed, finding data for a new (or even experienced) user can be challenging. The primary use-case of this app is for a Splunk adminstrator to be able to easily catalog (using a CSV file) where specific types of data (that an end user may have interest in) would be found on the given system and provide the end user an interface to quickly find this data (using Splunk’s built in menu system). Even though there exists the CIM, not all data is CIM compatible, nor is a user necessarily familiar with CIM. This can be especially helpful as new data types become available in Splunk that are not complying with CIM.
How to use
Adminstrator
The app comes with an example CSV lookup file with sections, subsections and searches that should be universal. Using the built-in dashboard to add searches, an administrator can fill the catalog with the necessary content for the users. The CSV can also be edited directly or the app contains links to open the file in the Lookup File Editor app (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1724/ requires 2.x), especially useful if searches need to be deleted. While it is not required, it is recommended to fill out the Notes section of each search so that both the generated dashboard will give some helpful context and a user may find the search based on keywords in the notes (using the search dashboard called “Not Sure Where to Look?""). The administrator should either copy the example CSV found in the samples directory to the lookups directory or use the add searches dashboard to create the file. The add searches dashboard includes help information.
Once the lookup/CSV file has been populated with searches, the app has a custom command to generate menus, dashboards, and links based on the data in the lookup (“Generate Dashboards”). Each search can be given it’s own dashboard with notes, events, and some basic info and statistics of it’s primary fields. There are also links to open the search up in the normal search window (in the regular Search app not the Search Catalog) from the dashboard as well as a time range picker. The other option is send the user to a specific link (like an existing dashboard) or convert the search into a link and skipping the generated dashboard and only adding a menu item.
Each generated dashboard includes a panel titled “Most Populated Fields”. If an admin wants to filter specific fields out of this (i.e. date_*) the most_populated_filter.csv file must be created and filled. Similar to the search_catalog.csv the app contains an example most_populated_filter.csv, and again the administrator should either copy the example CSV found in the samples directory to the lookups directory or use the add searches dashboard to create the file.
End User
From the Welcome screen a user is introduced to the number of searches that exist in the search catalog along with an idea of how those searches are dispersed. The user is given instructions to browse through the Search Catalog’s menus, search or see what are the latest searches that have been added.",Version 1.2.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/f0bd5082-8cba-11ea-8650-0281150c11dc.png,Utilities,https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/,794,0,splunk,0,0,Nathan Worsham,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/worshamn,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise

Welcome to the OpenIntelligence Natural Language Interface for Splunk.
Our natural language interface allows both novices and experienced Splunk users to search for information or define complex correlation rules in their own language. 
The interface uses an entity driven approach (e.g. devices or accounts) to incrementally build complex natural language queries (a subset with a very precise and unambiguous semantic) and translate them to the Splunk SPL query language. These entities also help to identify suitable queries and automatically generate joining attributes between different event types.
This initial version of the App offers two different natural language wizards. Later version will complement these wizards with a natural language search bar.
For additional documentation or access to the latest version of this app, please visit openintelligence-nli-app or visit the public github project openintelligence_nli_app.
Technology
The OpenIntelligence Natural Language Interface for Splunk enables any end user to create plain English queries, avoiding the need to learn the Splunk Processing Language (SPL). The patented (pending) OpenIntelligence Natural Language technology parses these English queries to logical expressions specifying their full semantic (i.e. meaning including intent and context) on the fly and then translate these logical statements to optimized SPL queries.  This approach enables the user to select/confirm a very precise meaning for each query and generates highly efficient queries, accurate results, and powerful visualizations.
Dependencies
This app has the following dependencies:
- Licensed access to the Rest API of an OpenIntelligence Natural Language Rules Engine instance. This REST API provides access to our sophisticated Rules Engine and its capability to translate natural language statements to Splunk queries. 
- The Webtools Add-on.  This Add-on includes a curl command and is used to access the Rest API above. This Add-on may be downloaded at Webtools Add-on.
Our App works best  when the Splunk Common Information Model App (Splunk_SA_CIM) is installed. This App is available at Splunk_SA_CIM.
Rest API Licenses
OpenIntelligence offers three different Rest API/SW licenses:
-  A Trial Licence  provides temporary access to the Rest API of our Rules Engine development instance. The trial license is for evaluation purposes only and provides limited functionality. 
-  A Shared Production License  provides access to the Rest API of our shared Rules Engine Production instance and includes OpenIntelligence standard support. 
-  A Custom Production Licence  provides access to a dedicated and customized Rules Engine Production instance with several hosting and support options.
Please visit licenses for more details and how to request any of these licences.
Install Instructions
This App depends on a valid Rest API license that will provide you with the Rules Engine URL (host/port) and initial user credentials (user/password).
Please Install the App and above dependencies and then configure the apps macros oi_host, oi_port and oi_user with the values provided by your license (remember to insert all values between double-quotes).
You will also need to setup a user and password in passwords.conf (please follow the template provided in the default folder) and reload the settings (e.g. restart the server).
The password may be entered in plain test or encoded (""encrypted"") using Splunk standard encoding of credentials.
To obtain an encoded version of your password, please run the following command in your Splunk instance:
For NIX instances:
/opt/splunk/bin/splunk show-encrypted --value YOUR_PLAIN_TEXT_LICENSE_PASSWORD
For Window instances:
C:\Program Files\Splunk\bin> .\splunk.exe show-encrypted YOUR_PLAIN_TEXT_LICENSE_PASSWORD
This App includes two saved searches: CacheEntities and CacheEvents that synchronize cached entities and events with their latest definition in the Rest API server.
If you have installed the latest version of the Splunk App you will only need to run theses searches each time a new version of the Rest API has been released (we will notify you of any release date in advance). Alternatively, you could download the latest version of this App that will include updated versions of cached entities and events.
For Customized Production instances is recommended to schedule both searches to run daily or maybe more often depending on the frequency of your changes to the entities, data-models and events tables.
Available Versions
The trial and shared versions of the rule engine generate both simple and complex correlation and statistical queries that could be run in any platform where the CIM Model App is available. They also generate queries using some common events like Windows events (you will not need the CIM Model App in this case).
Custom versions extend these capabilities with optimized queries using organisation specific data-models, events, and lookups.  It also enables the organizations to extend the product natural language capabilities by defining new entities, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs.
Main Menu

The Event Wizard enable building simple and complex correlations and statistical operations over CIM data-models/common events. 
The Entity Wizard extends the Event Wizard with entities (e.g. device, account) driving the generation of the natural language statements.
The search option give you access to Splunk standard search bar (to be replaced by a natural language search bar in the next version of this tool).
The Entities Mapping displays list of identified entities and their mapping to local lookups/queries (to update available entities and associated mappings you will need a valid Custom licence).

Troubleshooting
If the Webtools Add-on is not installed or the App is unable to connect to a licensed OI-Rest API, the App will return an error message.
If the Splunk_SA_CIM App is not installed, many of the generated queries will not be able to be executed in this Splunk environment (but they could be copied to run in other environments where this App is available).

Synopsis
This TA represents a collection of diverse Splunk visualizations packed all into one app. The advantage of this is the ease of installation and management of all visualizations through one TA. The Repository contains all Data in /opt/splunk/etc/apps/Splunk_TA_common-viz. The installed versions of the visualizations are listed below.
Install this TA on all Search Heads you want to use with more than the standard Visualizations.
Visualizations make it easier to analyze and interact with data during investigations or within dashboards and reports.
The right visual goes a long way to understanding the results of the analysis of your most complex data.
With rich visualization you can easily find the right diagram to make your results known across your organization—in the boardroom or in the war room.
Splunkbase contains a wide array of Splunk-built visuals, and a development framework that makes it simple for customers and partners to create new visuals and make them available to the community.

Who is this app for?
This app is for anyone who wants to display seVersional metrics on a small area of a dashboard.
How does the app work?
This app provides a visualization that you can use in your own apps and dashboards.
To use it in your dashboards, simply install the app, and create a search that provides the values you want to display.
Limits
Some visualization are bound by the follwoing limits:
- Total results: 1000
Dependencies
Once you have installed the TA, you can delete all other additionally installed visualization Addons like timeline visualization.
Compare the List shown in chapter Active Visualization addons and remove all additional installed.
After uninstalling all old visualization addons, you may need to adapt the path of the visualization in the dashboards.
Otherwise Splunk cannot find the correct path where the Visualisation is installed.
In our case the path where the new app Splunk_TA_common-viz is installed.
Here an example what to migrate in case that you used the timeline visualization in the past.

Background
This TA will collect metrics from the docker host using commands such as docker stats and docker ps.
It is called ""docker simple"" because it is suited for small, simple docker environments. 
I created this app becuase I needed to monitor my home docker environment and I couldn't figure out how to do it in a simple manner.
The app is a fork of this: https://github.com/splunk/docker-itmonitoring/tree/master/ta-dockerstats
If you have docker swarms, use kubernetes or have anything remotely complex then you should instead consider using a different solution, such as:
- Outcold add-on here: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3723/  (Note: this is a paid app)
- CollectD to a HTTP Event Collector input  (More info in Marc's 2017 .conf talk at bottom of this page)
- Splunk official: https://github.com/splunk/splunk-connect-for-kubernetes
- Whatever else you can find...
Contents and requirements
This app contains a couple of shell scripts for data collection, some inputs that are disabled by default, some parsing properties and some search-time field extractions. 
This app does not require python.
The shell scripts call docker commands and by default these are restricted to root. As such you will need to run the UF as root or come up with your own creative solution (such as using cron and redirecting to a file, or see note below about running in a container).
This TA does not require changing the default container logging agent and reads the JSON logs directly. There is a disabled input to read the default docker logs from the default location of /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*json.log. 
Installation
Typically you would run this TA on a universal forwarder, probably via a deployment server. In any case, like most other TA's you should do this:
1. Create an index to receive your data
2. Install this TA onto your Search Head(s), 
3. Install this TA and onto your Indexer/s or heavy forwarder/s (That is, if your data goes through a heavy forwarder)
4. Create a local/ folder in this TA
5. Copy default/inputs.conf.example to local/
6. Rename it to ""inputs.conf""
7. Edit the file and set:
   - Which inputs will not be disabled
   - The index to send the data to
   - Your desired polling rate
8. Save the TA (if necessary deploy it) and restart the UF.
9. Optionally get and install the pre-canned dashboards in the ""Docker Simple"" app: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4467/
Collecting metrics from within a container
It is possible to collect metrics from within a docker container if you mount the docker socket like so: -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock and also install the docker CLI tools into the container. 
Thanks
Thank you to Marc Chéné who did most of the original work on which this TA is based.

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2689,2022-01-10,08:23:07 AM,Dell EMC Isilon Add-on for Splunk Enterprise,,"May 15, 2020","ABOUT THIS APP
The Dell Isilon Add-on for Splunk Enterprise is used to gather data from Isilon Cluster, do indexing on it and provide the indexed data to the ""Dell Isilon App for Splunk Enterprise"" app which runs searches on indexed data and build dashboards using it.
REQUIREMENTS

Splunk version 7.2.x, 7.3.x and 8.0.0
Dell Isilon cluster with oneFS version 7.1.x, 8.0.x and 8.1.x
If using a forwarder, it must be a HEAVY forwarder(we use the HF because the universal forwarder does not include python)
The forwarder system must have network access (HTTPS) to one or more Isilon nodes which are to be Splunked.
Admin user ID and password for collecting data from the Isilon node.

RECOMMENDED SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

Splunk forwarder system should have 4 GB of RAM and a quad-core CPU to run this app smoothly.

TOPOLOGY AND SETTING UP SPLUNK ENVIRONMENT

This app has been distributed in two parts.

1) Add-on app, which runs collector scripts and gathers data from Dell Isilon node, does indexing on it and provides indexed data to the Main app.
  2) The main app, which receives indexed data from the Add-on app, runs searches on it and builds dashboard using indexed data.


This App can be set up in two ways:
  1) Standalone Mode: Install the main app and Add-on app on a single machine.

Here both the app resides on a single machine.
The main app uses the data collected by Add-on app and builds dashboard on it



2) Distributed Environment: Install main app and Add-on app on search head, Only Add-on on the forwarder system and need to create index manually on Indexer.
 * Here also both the apps reside on search head machine, but no need to configure Add-on on the search head.
 * Only Add-on needs to be installed and configured on the forwarder system.
 * On Indexer, Create index from menu Settings-> Indexes-> New, Give the name of an index (for eg. isilon), which has been used in TA setup form on the forwarder system.
 * Execute the following command on the forwarder to forward the collected data to the indexer.
   $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk add forward-server <indexer_ip_address>:9997
 * On Indexer machine, enable event listening on port 9997 (recommended by Splunk).
 * The main app on the search head uses the received data and builds dashboards on it.

INSTALLATION OF APP

This app can be installed through UI using ""Manage Apps"" or extract zip file directly into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ folder.

CONFIGURATION OF APP


After installation, go to the Apps->Manage Apps->Set up TA_EMC-Isilon. A new set up screen will open, which will ask for Isilon node credentials. Provide ip address, username, password for any one Isilon node of your cluster. There is an option to provide an index. The default value of the index is isilon. A user has to make sure, the provided index has already been created from the menu Settings->Indexes. After providing these details, click save on Setup form. Once the setup has completed successfully, go to Settings->Advanced search->Search macros. Open entry 'isilon_index' from the list and modify the definition of macro according to index provided in setup form. The default definition is index=isilon.


If you want to collect data over encrypted network then please follow below steps:

Copy isilonappsetup.conf to the local folder within an app
Keep verify=True as is
Add certificate path where you have stored the certificate pem file.
Restart Splunk


If you want to collect data over unencrypted network then please follow below steps:
Copy isilonappsetup.conf to local folder within an app
Change verify=False on the [setupentity] stanza in the local/isilonappsetup.conf file
Restart Splunk
After restart configure the Isilon host through the gui.


Splunk REST API will encrypt the password and store it in Add-on folder in encrypted form, REST modular script will fetch these credentials through REST API to connect to the Isilon node.
Restart the Splunk

To enable forwarding syslog data in any Isilon Cluster version, perform the following step:
    1) Make following changes in file /etc/mcp/override/syslog.conf (copy from /etc/mcp/default/syslog.conf if not present) :
          * Put @<forwarders_ip_address> in front of the required log file and !* at the end of the syslog.conf file.
          * Restart syslogd using this command - /etc/rc.d/syslogd restart.

In some cases, syslog.conf file is already placed at /etc/mcp/override directory location but it is empty. In that case,  just put the log file name and the forwarder ip in that file.
     Below is the cotent of sample syslog.conf:
              auth.    @<forwarders_ip_address>
              !audit_config
.    @<forwarders_ip_address>
              !audit_protocol
.*    @<forwarders_ip_address>      !*



2) Run the following commands to enable protocol, config and syslog auditing according to Isilon OneFS version:
    * For Dell Isilon cluster with oneFS version 7.x.x - 
        isi audit settings modify --protocol-auditing-enabled Yes
        isi audit settings modify --config-auditing-enabled Yes 
        isi audit settings modify --config-syslog-enabled Yes
* For Dell Isilon cluster with oneFS version 8.x.x -
    isi audit settings global modify --protocol-auditing-enabled Yes
    isi audit settings global modify --config-auditing-enabled Yes 
    isi audit settings global modify --config-syslog-enabled Yes
    isi audit settings modify --syslog-forwarding-enabled Yes



Enable receiving the syslog data at forwarder. To do that, go to Settings -> Data Inputs -> UDP -> New. Provide the port number(514 is recommended by Splunk), sourcetype as emc:isilon:syslog and index same as provided in setup form of TA for same isilon cluster to this data input entry.  

Make sure while receiving syslogs on you have set following metadata - index=Name of index, same as defined in above UDP data input, sourcetype=emc:isilon:syslog.

External Data Sources
We are using Dell Dell Isilon API for data collection purpose.
CIM COMPATIBILITY
This app is compatible  with ""Authentication"",""Inventory"" and ""Performance"" datamodels of Splunk CIM (Common information model).
TEST YOUR INSTALL
The main app dashboard can take some time to populate the dashboards Once data collection is started. A good test to see that you are receiving all of the data we expect is to run this search after several minutes:
search `isilon_index` | stats count by sourcetype

In particular, you should see these sourcetypes:
 emc:isilon:rest
 emc:isilon:syslog
If you don't see these sourcetypes, have a look at the messages for ""emc:isilon:rest"". User can see logs at $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/isilon/emc_isilon.log file.
For ""emc:isilon:syslog"", check the syslog file in /etc/mcp/override/syslog.conf - it should have @<forwarders_ip_address> in front of the required log file and !* at the end of the syslog.conf file. Also, run following command to see whether the syslog forwarding is enabled or not:
For Dell Isilon cluster with oneFS version 7.x.x - isi audit settings view
For Dell Isilon cluster with oneFS version 8.x.x - isi audit settings view, isi audit settings global view
Dell Isilon forward syslog and audit logs on 514 UDP port by default. Please make sure port 514 is open and reserved for Isilon syslogs only.
SAMPLE EVENT GENERATOR
The TA_EMC-Isilon, comes with sample data files, which can be used to generate sample data for testing. In order to generate sample data, it requires SA-Eventgen application.
The TA will generate sample data of rest api calls and sys logs at an interval of 10 minutes. You can update this configuration from eventgen.conf file available under $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA_EMC-Isilon/default/.
UPGRADE TA (v2.2 to v2.3)
Follow below steps to upgrade Dell Isilon Technology addon from version 2.2 to 2.3
 Download tar of Dell Isilon Technology addon from splunk base (v2.3)

Uninstallation of App
This section provides the steps to uninstall App from a standalone Splunk platform installation.


(Optional) If you want to remove data from Splunk database, you can use the below Splunk CLI clean command to remove indexed data from an app before deleting the app.

$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk clean eventdata -index <index_name>



Delete the app and its directory. The app and its directory are typically located in the folder$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/<appname> or run the following command in the CLI:

$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk remove app [appname] -auth <splunk username>:<splunk password> 



You may need to remove user-specific directories created for your app by deleting any files found here: $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/etc/users/*/<appname>


Restart the Splunk platform. You can navigate to Settings -> Server controls and click the restart button in Splunk web UI or use the following Splunk CLI command to restart Splunk:

$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk restart



TEST YOUR INSTALL


Once the Add-on app is configured to receive data from ACI, The main app dashboard can take some time before the data is populated in all panels. A good test to see that you are receiving all of the data is to run this search after several minutes:
index=""<your index>"" | stats count by sourcetype


Troubleshooting APIC configuration:

In particular, you should see these sourcetypes:
cisco:apic:health
cisco:apic:stats
cisco:apic:class
cisco:apic:authentication
cisco:apic:cloud



If you don't see these sourcetypes, have a look at the messages output by the scripted input: collect.py. Here is a sample search that will show them:
    index=_internal component=""ExecProcessor"" collect.py ""ACI Error:"" | table _time host log_level message


Troubleshooting MSO configuration:

You should see this sourcetype: cisco:mso
If you don't see this sourcetype, have a look at the messages output by the scripted input: collect_mso.py. Here is a sample search that will show them:
    index=_internal component=""ExecProcessor"" collect_mso.py ""MSO Error:"" | table _time host log_level message

You can also see $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log file to check if any error has occurred.
Data Model
This app stores the indexed data in accelerated datamodels and build dashboards by fetching data from datamodels. Below is the list of datamodels that have been created in the app.

Auth - Maps authentication details from the ACI Environment.
Health - Maps health and fault information for all the MOs of given classes.
Fault - Maps to defects or faults present on APIC.
Systems - Maps to general information for all the MOs of given classes.
Counters - Maps to general information for all the MOs of given classes.
Statistics - Maps to statistical data for all the MOs of given classes.

Events - Maps to general information for all the MOs of class=eventrecord.


If you want to improve the performance of dashboards, you must need to enable the acceleration of datamodel. Please follow the below steps:

Go to Settings -> Data Models
Filter with Cisco ACI App For Splunk Enterprise
In Action tab, Click on Edit and click Edit Acceleration
Check Acceleration checkbox and select the appropriate summary range and Save it
Warning: Acceleration may increase storage and processing costs.

Additional Features
In addition to out-of-the-box reporting and analytics capabilities for your ACI environment, the app includes a set of pre-defined dashboards for specific user roles:


Helpdesk admin: Enables Help desk operator to analyze various faults in the system and escalate them to tenant or fabric admin accordingly. He will have access to only ""Home"", ""Authentication"" and ""Helpdesk"" dashboards.


Tenant admin:  Enables Tenant admin to analyze and drill down faults and health related issues to a particular tenant. He can drill down into Applications, EPGs, and VM endpoints to identify a single point of failure within the admin. He will have access to only ""Home"", ""Authentication"" and ""Tenants"" Dashboards.  


Fabric admin: Enables Fabric Admin to analyze physical network related issues. It gives visibility into fabric components of networks e.g. leaf, spine and it's physical components like chassis, ports, fan tray, line card, etc.


Tenant user: Enables Tenant User to manage a specific tenant and all of its components like Application, EPGs ,and VMs. To create a Tenant user for tenant ""ABC"", follow the steps given below.


1) Create a role with name ""tenant_ABC"". In search criteria put ""dn=uni/tn-ABC/*"".
2) Create a new user with the name user-ABC and apply the role of ""tenant_ABC"" to this user.
3) Edit the permission of Tenant Dashboard to provide read access to a user with the role ""tenant_ABC"".

vmware admin: This app has been integrated with the Splunk App for VMware to get the VM details of your datacenter as a client endpoint of APIC. A separate dashboard is provided which can be accessed by splunk_vmware_admin and splunk_vmware_user. Both of these roles are configured with the Splunk App for VMware. You can get a VMware app at https://apps.splunk.com/app/725/ and its documentation https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/VMW/3.0.1/Install/SplunkforVMwareArchitecture.

The app also includes a set of MSO dashboards for specific use cases:
New Dashboards


Sites: Information about sites associated with MSO and the fault count of various severity levels. Drill-downs are provided in Site Information, Site Health graph, and panels consisting of fault counts, so users can get a detailed view of the same.


Schemas: Information about schemas configured with MSO. Drill down into No. of Schemas Associated With MSO single pane visualization will show schema details, drill-down on Application Profiles, Bridge Domain, External EPGs, and VRF single pane visualization to get insights about particular health and fault details and drill-down on contracts will show contracts health details.


Tenants: Graphical representation of tenants associated with sites, schemas, and users. Drill down on table showing Tenant Details for a particular site will re-direct to Tenant Details dashboard giving more description about the selected tenant. 


Users: Information about MSO users and their roles. More details about user and roles are given by drill down on Users and Roles panel.


Policy: Information about policies configured in MSO. Drill down on Policy SubType Breakdown panel will show details of specific subtype.


All the MSO dashboards have Audit Logs panel showing Audit Logs of a particular type, for example, schemas dashboard have audit logs only of type schema.
Troubleshooting

If any warning displayed in dashboards of the app stating excessive memory usage of mvexpand command like: output will be truncated at xxx results due to excessive memory usage... , user can manually increase the memory limit in limits.conf
Default value of max_mem_usage_mb parameter is 500 MB. to increase the limit follow below steps.
create limits.conf file under $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/cisco-app-ACI/local

Overview
This app provides dashboards and reports based on events from anti-malware systems. To do this, the app relies on the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) for malware detection events. This means that the app can report on any malware/av data, as long as it has been on-boarded properly, and is available through the Malware data model.
A note on Splunk Data Model Acceleration and Disk Space
This app requires data model acceleration, which will use additional disk space. If you are using the Splunk App for Enterprise Security, this is already enabled, and should have been factored into your retention policies. If not, you should review the documentation on data model acceleration, how it uses disk space, and how to plan for it.
A note on the Splunk Common Information Model
As mentioned above, the app uses the CIM for malware events. The CIM allows you to take events from a number of sources or products, and report on them in one cohesive manner, using a common set of names for fields and event types.
Available Dashboards
Malware Overview
Provides a starting point for exploring your malware detection events. Most panels will drill-down to other pages in the application.
Signature Profile
Panels around a particular signature detected. Note that there is no normalization for the values of this field, so this will be dependent on the naming used by the vendor for the individual anti-malware products.
Destination Profile
Panels around a malware detected on a particular destination. The destination field in the Malware data model is the system on which the malware has been detected. This dashboard also contains a panel which shows malware operations (such as signatures being updated).
Category Profile
Panels with reports on category of malware. As with signature names, category names are not normalized across vendors.
File Name Profile
Reports on individual file names.
Malware Search (Advanced)
A form for finding events based on various field values.
Malware Sourcetypes (Advanced)
Information about the sourcetypes which are present in the accelerated data.

Prerequisites
Because this App runs on Splunk Enterprise, all of the Splunk Enterprise system requirements apply.
This app depends on data models included in the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on, specifically the Malware data model. Please review the information on installing and using the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on and information on configuring the acceleration on the data model.
The Splunk Common Information Model Add-on can be downloaded from Splunkbase.
This app has been tested with versions 4.9 of the CIM add-on.
In order to make the app respond and load quickly, accelerated data models are used to provide summary data. For this data to be available, the Malware data model must be accelerated. Information on how to enable acceleration for the Malware data model can be found here. The data model must be accelerated for the length of time for which you would like to see reporting.
The Breakdown of Sourcetypes in Indexes in Dataset panel on the Data Transparency Overview dashboard will only be seen if the Sankey Diagram visualization is installed.
The Sankey Diagram Visualization can be downloaded from Sankey Diagram Custom Visualization.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
1. Please try installing the App on your own instead of requesting it to be installed for a better experience.  Simply Browse for more Apps, search for chargeback and then click on Install next to the Chargeback App for Splunk Cloud.  You can refer to this guide: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/latest/Admin/SelfServiceAppInstall#Install_an_app
2. Please add a new column to the chargeback_app_2_bunit_csv.csv lookup table and call it perc_ownership
3. Please watch this video to learn how to configure the app on your own: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LFRlkfEJFlCzyXiIUvjPSmL7uT0_T1ma
Please install the following Apps on the same Cloud Search Head or Search Head Cluster you are intending to install and use the Chargeback App for Splunk Cloud:
1. Lookup File Editor
2. Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit
Please note that you must install the Python for Scientific Computing Add-on before installing the Machine Learning Toolkit. Please download and install the appropriate version here:

chargeback_identities_custom_kv_store_lookup_gen ""Custom Identities Enrichments CSV Lookup Gen Job (Daily)""
chargeback_summary_identities_kv_store_lookup_gen ""Chargeback Identities KV Store Gen Job From Summary Index (Daily)""

II. Configure Chargeback Summary Job Weights and Summary Index:

Adjust the chargeback_summary_index and enter in the Definition box an index name you would like to use to store the summary data generated by the above jobs .  It's recommended to use an index called chargeback_summary with a retention of at least 13 months but ideally 2 years.  Make sure this index was created before saving.

After you are done enabling the Jobs above and configuring an index to use, click on the Save button at the bottom of the screen to complete the setup and then close the Setup Screen tab in your browser,
Perform the following steps for the first time to get the necessary Chargeback Identity enrichments working:
Step 1
Run the Splunk Cloud Stack Search Head Info Job  for the first time and make sure the job produced data.  The job creates the chargeback_cloud_stack_info_csv_lookup Lookup Table used in later jobs to populate the label field to accurately store user information in later steps.
Step 2
From the App Navigation Menu select App Configuration and then Select App Setup.
Under section 3 Chargeback App for Splunk Cloud Jobs click on the Chargeback Custom Identities Gen Job (Edit and customize this Job) to open the job for editing.
Configure the Job to collect the following information about users in your organization that are using Splunk Cloud today or potentially may use it in the future:
    1. user_name
    2. name
    3. type
    4. title
    5. email
    6. biz_unit
    7. biz_dep
Step 3
Click on the Chargeback Identities - Summary Index - Gen Job - From REST to collect all the users defined on the Search Head you are running this job on.
This job must be configured on every Search Head in your stack including your Input Data Manager (IDM).
Step 4
Login to every Standalone Search Head and Search Head Cluster in your stack and create the following Job:
Job Name: chargeback_rest_identities_summary_data_gen
Job Schedule: Edit the Job and Schedule it with the following Cron Expression: 18 3 * * * 
Job Search:
| rest /servicesNS/-/-/authentication/users splunk_server=local timeout=0
| rename title As user_name , realname As name roles As splunk_role_map type As auth_type
| eval Splunk_Instance = lower(splunk_server), user_name = lower(trim(user_name)), email = lower(email)
| stats Last(name) As name , Last(email) As email , Values(splunk_role_map) As splunk_role_map , Values(auth_type) As auth_type By Splunk_Instance, user_name
| eval _time = now() | foreach splunk_role_map, auth_type [ eval <<FIELD>>=mvjoin(mvsort(mvdedup('<<FIELD>>')), ""|"") ]
| table _time, Splunk_Instance, user_name, name, email, splunk_role_map, auth_type
| collect index=chargeback_summary source=splunk_rest_identities_summary_data sourcetype=stash testmode=false | stats count

Finish by running the Job for the first time on the Search Head or Search Head Cluster you configured it on.
Step 5
Go back to the App Setup Dashboard and click on the Chargeback Identities - KV Store - Gen Job - From Summary Index Job to create the chargeback_rest_identities_kv_store_lookup KV Store Lookup for the first time.
Step 6
Click on the Chargeback Tracker Job link and make sure the job produces data and runs without any errors.

App Terminology

Splunk Cloud Virtual Core (SVC) is a unit of capabilities that includes these resources in Splunk Cloud: compute, memory, and I/O.
Dynamic Data: Active Searchable(DDAS) is used for searching ingested data. DDAS is also commonly known as searchable storage or Local Storage including Splunk Cloud SmartStore.  For further information see: Dynamic Data: Data Retention Options in Splunk Cloud
Dynamic Data: Active Archive(DDAA) is Splunk Cloud Index Archiving in AWS S3 Glacier.  Its an optional Splunk Cloud subscription.  DDAA offers a lower cost option for long term storage of your ingested data.  DDAA Can be restored to DDAS to be searched.
Dynamic Data: Self-Storage(DDSS) is your own Index Archiving Self Storage AWS S3 Bucket.  It allows you to export your aged data from Splunk Cloud Platform. If you enable DDSS to export your aged ingested data, the oldest data is moved to your Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage account in the same region as your Splunk Cloud Platform deployment before it is deleted from the index.
-- Please Note the following about DDSS:  You are responsible for payments for your use of Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage. Aged data is exported unencrypted to your Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage account.  For further information see:
Dynamic Data: Self-Storage - Compliance, Cloud and Data Lifecycle and Splunk Cloud Platform Service Description

Tips and tricks for growing your Splunk instance from 50GB/day to 1TB/day
The conf 2017 presentation recording is available here, and PDF only here. The powerpoint presentation is available here
Introduction
This application accompanies the Splunk conf 2017 presentation ""How did you get so big? Tips and tricks for growing your Splunk installation from 50GB/day to 1TB/day""
The overall idea behind this application is to provide a variety of alerts that detect issues or potential issues within the splunk log files and then advise via an alert that this has occurred
This application was built as there were a variety of messages in the Splunk console and logs in Splunk that if acted upon could have prevented an issue within the environment.
The original presentation is available as a recording or PDF
The powerpoint should it be required is available here
There are many potential alerts that might cause an issue so this application has all alerts disabled by default, post-installation once the required macros are configured you can enable the alerts you wish to use and add the required actions
There are also dashboards for investigating indexer performance, heavy forwarder queue usage, data model acceleration issues among other items that may be of interest to a Splunk admin
Please note that the all alerts & dashboards were tested on Linux-based Splunk infrastructure, with AIX, Linux and Windows forwarders
If you are running your Splunk enterprise installation on Windows or have customised your installation directory you will need to customise some of the macros such as splunkadmins_splunkd_source to point to the correct splunkd log file location
Also note that this application contains a very large number of alerts which you can use, you may wish to utilise the allow_skew in savedsearches.conf to allow the scheduler to balance out the scheduled alerts execution times
Finally, the application has evolved over the years, more recent releases have resulted in very generic alerts such as AllSplunkEnterpriseLevel - Splunkd Log Messages Admins Only, this is designed as a ""catch all"" to cover many splunkd log messages. The older alerts are very specific as the team I worked in was new to Splunk and required a more specific outcome/action based on each alert
Feel free to use either, and feedback or contributions via github or email are always welcome
Macros - required configuration
The various saved searches and dashboards use macros within their searches, you will need to update the macros to ensure the searches/dashboards work as expected
To check the contents of the macros in Splunk 7 or newer, use CTRL-SHFT-E within the search window
The macros are listed below, many expect a host=A OR host=B item to assist in narrowing down a search while others expect only a single value...note that for splunk_server values they are always lower-case and case-sensitive!
indexerhosts - a host=... list of your indexers (for example host=indexer1 OR host=indexer2)
heavyforwarderhosts - a host=... list of your heavy forwarders (for example host=heavyforwarder1 OR host=heavyforwarder2)
searchheadhosts - a host=... list of your search head(s) (for example host=searchhead1 OR host=searchhead2)
localsearchheadhosts - a host=... list of your search head(s) within the cluster that these alerts are running on
splunkenterprisehosts - a host=... list of any Splunk enterprise instance (for example host=indexer1 OR host=searchhead1 OR ...)
deploymentserverhosts - a host=... list of deployment server(s) (for example host=splunkdeploymentserver)
licensemasterhost - a host=... entry for the license master server (for example host=splunklicensemaster)
searchheadsplunkservers - a splunk_server=... list of any Splunk search head hosts (for example splunk_server=searchhead*)
splunkindexerhostsvalue - a splunk_server=... list of any Splunk indexer hosts (for example splunk_server=indexer*)
splunkadmins_splunkd_source - this defaults to source=*splunkd.log, for a slight improvement in performance you can make this a specific file such as /opt/splunk/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log
splunkadmins_splunkuf_source - this defaults to source=*splunkd.log, you may wish to narrow down this location if your splunkd logs on universal forwarders have consistent installation directories
splunkadmins_mongo_source - this defaults to source=*mongod.log, for a slight improvement in performance you can make this a specific file such as /opt/splunk/var/log/splunk/mongod.log
splunkadmins_clustermaster_oshost - a host=... entry for the cluster master server (for example host=splunkclustermaster)
The macros are used in various alerts which you can optionally enable, the alerts will raise a triggered alert only as emails are not allowed for Splunk app certification purposes
The macros are also used in the dashboards for this application
The vast majority of the alerts also have a macro(s) which you can customise to tweak the search results, for example the macro splunkadmins_weekly_truncated allows the alert, IndexerLevel - Weekly Truncated Logs Report, to be customised without changing the alert itself. This will make upgrading to a new version of this app more straightforward
I have attempted to provide an appropriate macro in any alert where I deemed it appropriate, feedback is welcome for any alert that you believe should have a macro or requires further improvement
Installation
The application is designed to work on a search head or search head cluster instance, installation on the indexing tier is not required
There are a few searches that use REST API calls which are specific to the search head cluster they run on. These alerts will have to be placed on each search head or search head cluster, alternatively any server with the required search peers will also work, the relevant alerts are:
- SearchHeadLevel - Accelerated DataModels with All Time Searching Enabled
- SearchHeadLevel - Realtime Scheduled Searches are in use
- SearchHeadLevel - Realtime Search Queries in dashboards
- SearchHeadLevel - Scheduled Searches without a configured earliest and latest time
- SearchHeadLevel - Scheduled searches not specifying an index
- SearchHeadLevel - Scheduled searches not specifying an index macro version
- SearchHeadLevel - Scheduled Searches Configured with incorrect sharing
- SearchHeadLevel - Saved Searches with privileged owners and excessive write perms
- SearchHeadLevel - User - Dashboards searching all indexes
- SearchHeadLevel - User - Dashboards searching all indexes macro version
- SearchHeadLevel - Users exceeding the disk quota (recent jobs list uses a REST call so you may need to adjust the search), the SearchHeadLevel - Users exceeding the disk quota introspection is a non-search head specific alternative
The following reports also are specific to a search head or search head cluster:
- SearchHeadLevel - Alerts that have not fired an action in X days
- SearchHeadLevel - Data Model Acceleration Completion Status
- SearchHeadLevel - Macro report
- What Access Do I Have?
The following dashboards are search head or search head cluster specific:
- Data Model Rebuild Monitor
- Data Model Status
The following reports / alert must either run on the cluster master or a server where the cluster master is a peer:
- ClusterMasterLevel - Per index status
- ClusterMasterLevel - Primary bucket count per peer
Using the application
Once the application is installed, all alerts are disabled by default and you can enable those you require or want to test in your local environment.
If you choose not to customise the macros then many searches will search for all hosts, which will make the alerts and dashboards inaccurate!
Which alerts should be enabled?
The alerts are all useful for detecting a variety of different scenarios which may or may not be applicable within your Splunk environment
The description field has an (extremely) simple way of determining if an alert will require action, there are three levels:
  - Low - the alert is informational and likely relates to a potential issue, these alerts may produce false alarms
  - Moderate - the alert is a warning, most likely further action will need to be taken, a moderate chance of false alarms
  - High - the alert is likely relating to something that requires action and there is a very low chance that this will create false alarms
I do not have a nice way to auto-enable various alerts excluding editing the local/savedsearches.conf or via the GUI, any contribution of a setup file would be welcome here!
How is this application used?
In the current environment the vast majority of the alerts are enabled to detect issues, they raise automated tickets or email depending on the urgency of the specific alert.
There are a few environment characteristics that may require changes to the way the app is used, and feedback is welcome if there is a nicer way to structure the alerts/application
The overall assumption is that the admin(s) are not carefully watching the splunkd logs or the messages in the console of the monitoring server/Splunk servers
How is this application tested?
Before 2019 the universal forwarders in use are installed on a mix of Windows, Linux & AIX servers, in 2019 and beyond the testing scope has been vastly reduced to focus primarily on Splunk enterprise servers
All heavy forwarders, and Splunk enterprise installations are Linux based, while I expect the alerts will work with only changes to the macros.conf for a Windows based environment this remains untested
The test environment for this application has a single indexer cluster and two search head clusters
Why was this application and associated conf talk created?
Inspired by articles such as ""Things I wish I knew then"" and knowledge collected from various conference replays, SplunkAnswers, 200+ support tickets & nearly four years of working on a Splunk environment I decided that I would attempt to share what I have learned in an attempt to prevent others from repeating the same mistakes
There are many Splunk conf talks available on this subject in various conference replays, however my goal was to provide practical steps to implement the ideas. That is why this application exists
Which alerts are best suited to automation?

SearchHeadLevel - Scheduled searches not specifying an index
SearchHeadLevel - Scheduled Searches Configured with incorrect sharing
SearchHeadLevel - Splunk login attempts from users that do not have any LDAP roles
SearchHeadLevel - Scheduled Searches That Cannot Run
SearchHeadLevel - Scheduled Searches without a configured earliest and latest time
SearchHeadLevel - Users exceeding the disk quota
SearchHeadLevel - Users with auto-finalized searches
SearchHeadLevel - User - Dashboards searching all indexes
SearchHeadLevel - Detect Excessive Search Use - Dashboard - Automated
SearchHeadLevel - WLM aborted searches
SearchHeadLevel - Dashboards with all time searches set
SearchHeadLevel - SavedSearches using special characters
SearchHeadLevel - Dashboards using special characters
SearchHeadLevel - Dashboards using depends and running searches in the background
= SearchHeadLevel - Summary searches using realtime search scheduling
SearchHeadLevel - Searches dispatched as owner by other users
SearchHeadLevel - Search Messages user level
SearchHeadLevel - audit logs showing all time searches

Are all well suited to an automated email using the sendresults command or a similar function as they involve end user configuration which the individual can change/fix
Custom search commands
Due to the current SPL not handling a particular task well, and the lookup commands not supporting regular expressions, I found that the only workable solution was to create a custom lookup command.
Two exist:
- streamfilter - based on a single (or multivalue) field name, and a single (or multivalue) field with patterns, apply the regular expression in the pattern field against the nominated field(s)
- streamfilterwildcard - identical to streamfilter except that this takes a field name with wildcards, and assumes an index-style expression, so * becomes (?i)^[^_].*$, and example* becomes (?i)^example.*$
Search help is available and these are used within the reports in this application. The Splunk python SDK version 1.6.5 is also included as this is required as part of the app, an example from the reports is:
| streamfilterwildcard pattern=indexes fieldname=indexes srchIndexesAllowed
Where indexes is a field name containing a list of wildcards (_int*, _aud*) or similar, indexes is the output field name, srchIndexesAllowed is the field name which the indexes field will be compared to.
Each entry in the pattern field will be compared to each entry in the srchIndexesAllowed field in this example
To make this command work the Splunk python SDK is bundled into the app, if the bin directory is wiped due to issues with other applications this only disables the two commands which are used in Search Queries summary non-exact match so far
KVStore Usage
Some CSV lookups are now replaced with kvstore entries due to the ability to sync the kvstore across multiple search head or search head cluster(s) via apps like KV Store Tools Redux
Lookup Watcher
The Lookup Watcher is a modular input designed to work in either search head clusters or standalone Splunk instances to determine the modification time and size of all lookup files on the filesystem of the Splunk servers.
In a search head cluster the input will run on the captain only by running a rest call on each run, on a non-search head cluster it will always run.
To use this, on a non-search head cluster simply go to Settings -> Inputs and create the Lookup Watcher modular input, the name of the input does not matter, you just need to create 1 input.
Note that the debugMode is optional and defaults to false, enabling this generates more logs for troubleshooting.
Under the more settings button choose an index to send the data to and an interval to run the script
On a search head cluster you will need to push an inputs.conf via the deployer server (if you are unsure of the syntax create one on a standalone server first)
Once done the additional logs can be used to determine how often lookups are updated and how big they are
Lookup Watcher generates a log file is created in $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/ and will also be in the internal index with the name lookup_watcher.log
platform_stats reports
There are a number of reports with the keyword ""platform_stats"" in the title, these were designed to run mcollect commands and to collect data into a metric index
The metrics then contain detailed information around the number of users using Splunk per-search head cluster, data indexed at the indexing tier, resource usage per user et cetera.
There is plenty of detail in here but dashboards were not included for the information built from them, contributions welcome
Detecting which indexes are searched by Splunk users
As of version 8.0.8 there is still no accurate way to detect which indexes were searched by a user based on their level of access, the audit logs simply do not record which indexes were accessed
Therefore the following searches are part of this app to help achieve this goal:
- SearchHeadLevel - Search Queries summary exact match
- SearchHeadLevel - Search Queries summary non-exact match
As per the searches description they both require other reports such as SearchHeadLevel - Macro report, the description of each search details the various reports they rely on to make them work.
However these complicated searches are not 100% accurate, alternative searches exist in this app to work at the indexing tier:
- IndexerLevel - RemoteSearches Indexes Stats 
- IndexerLevel - RemoteSearches Indexes Stats Wildcard 
The remote_searches.log at the indexing tier does not (usually) need to perform macro substitution but instead you do not have information around the user that ran the searches so this search is more likely to overcount index access than the search tier version, it is also less likely to miss an index due to macro usage or similar...
In more detail, the challenges with the search head level's audit.log searches are:
- You cannot determine which index was used if multiple indexes were specified, for example a search such as index=A OR index=B, if this search results in more than 0 results, then you cannot be sure which index returned the results so both are recorded by searches in this app
- macros, eventtypes, tags and datamodels are recorded in the audit.log so you need to substitute the macro/eventtype/tag to correctly determine if an index is in use, to make this more complicated, macros can be nested so a macro may refer to another macro and the 2nd or 3rd macro may contain the index= information
- There are many ways to search an index, such as index= """", index IN (...), the regex'es attempt to deal with the various straightforward scenarios such as NOT index=A index=B, but it is not straightforward to correctly extract index names from the audit.log in all scenarios
- The audit.log information for ad-hoc searches does not record app-context, therefore even if you know the macro and user information, you cannot be sure which app the search was run from and therefore you cannot correctly substitute the macro/tag/eventtype information
At the indexing tier the remote_searches.log file has different challenges:
- While macros, eventtypes and tags are expanded (in most cases, there are bugs that allow macros to reach the indexing tier), you instead lose the user context in cases such as ad-hoc searches. This means that a search like index=* run by a user with permissions to access 1 index to these searches will appear to be accessing all indexes. The current implementation of the RemoteSearches queries in this app assume access to all indexes if the username is unknown (which may result in excess matching rather than missing searches)
- app context is again missing for ad-hoc searches, although this is less important at the indexing tier
- You cannot determine which index was used if multiple indexes were specified, for example a search such as index=A OR index=B, if this search results in more than 0 results, then you cannot be sure which index returned the results so both are recorded
The following ideas relate to this issue:
Better audit logs
Provide index access statistics to assist in capacity planning of the indexing tier

 Install the main app (Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights App for Splunk) and add-on app (Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights Add-On for Splunk) on a single machine.

 * Here both the app resides on a single machine.
 * The main app uses the data collected by the Add-on app and builds dashboards on it.

 Install the main app and add-on app on a distributed clustered environment.
 * Install the App on a Search Head or Search Head Cluster.
 * Install and configure the Add-on on a Heavy forwarder or an Indexer. (Heavy forwarder recommended)

Installation
Follow the below-listed steps to install an Add-On from the UI:


Download the add-on package.


From the UI navigate to  Apps -> Manage Apps.


In the top right corner select Install the app from file.


Select Choose File and select the App package.


Select Upload and follow the prompts.


OR

Directly from the Find More Apps section provided in Splunk Home Dashboard.

Uninstallation and Cleanup
This section provides the steps to uninstall App from a standalone Splunk platform installation.


(Optional) If you want to remove data from the Splunk database, you can use the below Splunk CLI clean command to remove indexed data from an app before deleting the app.

$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk clean eventdata -index <index_name>



Delete the app and its directory. The app and its directory are typically located in the folder $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/<appname> or run the following command in the CLI:

$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk remove app [appname] -auth <splunk username>:<splunk password>



You may need to remove user-specific directories created for your app by deleting any files found here: $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/etc/users/*/<appname>


Restart the Splunk platform. You can navigate to Settings -> Server controls and click the restart button in Splunk web UI or use the following Splunk CLI command to restart Splunk:

$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk restart



Macros

get_nexus_insights_index
If you are using a custom index in Add-on for data collection then kindly update the ""get_nexus_insights_index"" macro in the app.


summariesonly
If you want to visualize only accelerated data then change this macro to summariesonly=true.
Default value of the macro is summariesonly=false.



Alerts


Email Alert for Advisory

This alert will be triggered if at any point severity is critical for advisories data in Nexus Dashboard Insights.
By default, the alert will be disabled.



Email Alert for Anomaly

This alert will be triggered if at any point severity is critical for anomalies data in Nexus Dashboard Insights.
By default, the alert will be disabled.



Alerts Configuration


Enable Alert

Go to Alerts under Notification on the navigation bar.
Click on Edit for Email Alert for Advisory or Email Alert for Anomaly
In the dropdown click on Enable



Email ID on which the mail is intended should be set in the App, to do that follow the steps

Go to Alerts under Notification on the navigation bar.
Click on Edit for Email Alert for Advisory or Email Alert for Anomaly
In the dropdown click on Edit Alert
Under the Trigger Action section write your Email ID in the To field
Click on Save



DATA MODEL

The app consists of one data model ""Nexus Insights"" and two datasets:
Advisories - Maps advisories details from the Nexus Dashboard Insights Environment.
Anomalies - Maps anomalies details from the Nexus Dashboard Insights Environment.


The acceleration for the data model is disabled by default.
As all the dashboards are populated using data model queries and real-time search doesn't work with the data model, all the real-time search filters are disabled.
If you want to improve the performance of dashboards, you must need to enable the acceleration of datamodel. Please follow the below steps:
On Splunk menu bar, Click on Settings -> Data models
Filter with Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights App for Splunk
In the ""Actions"" column, click on Edit and click Edit Acceleration. This will display the pop-up menu for Edit Acceleration.
Check or uncheck Accelerate checkbox to ""Enable"" or ""Disable"" data model acceleration respectively.
If acceleration is enabled, select the summary range to specify the acceleration period. The recommended acceleration period is 7 days. The acceleration period can be changed as per user convenience.
To save acceleration changes click on the Save button.


Warning: The accelerated data models help in improving the performance of the dashboard but it increases the disk usage on the indexer.

REBUILDING DATA MODEL

In case there is no need to use the already indexed accelerated Data Model, the Data Model can be configured to rebuild from scratch for the specified acceleration period. Data Model can be rebuilt by the following steps:
On the Splunk menu bar, Click on Settings -> Data models.
Filter with Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights App for Splunk
From the list for Data models, expand the row by clicking the "">"" arrow in the first column of the row for the ""Nexus Insights"" Data model. This will display extra Data Model information in the ""Acceleration"" section.
From the ""Acceleration"" section click on the ""Rebuild"" link.
Monitor the status of ""Rebuild"" in the field ""Status"" of the ""Acceleration"" section. Reload the page to get the latest rebuild status.



Troubleshooting

If dashboards are not getting populated:
Check ""get_nexus_insights_index"" macro is updated if you are using the custom index.
Check either data model is accelerated or ""summariesonly"" macro is updated with summariesonly=true.
Make sure you have data in the given time range.
To check data is collected or not, run the ""get_nexus_insights_index | stats count by sourcetype"" query in the search. In particular, you should see these source types:
cisco:ni:anomalies
cisco:ni:advisories


Try expanding Time Range.



Additional Features
In addition to out-of-the-box reporting and analytics capabilities for your Nexus Dashboard Insights environment, the app includes a set of pre-defined dashboards for specific use cases:


Anomalies: Graphical representation of anomalies that provides a segregated view of anomalies overall sites with all configured NI instances or segregated view of anomalies overall sites for any specific NI instance or information about a single site for NI instance.


Advisories: Graphical representation of advisories that provides a segregated view of advisories overall sites with all configured NI instances or segregated view of advisories overall sites for any specific NI instance or information about a single site for NI instance.


Workflow Action: The app provides a workflow action ""Explore Anomaly Details on ND Insights Dashboard"" for event type cisco_ni_anomalies to explore details about a specific anomalyID on Nexus Dashboard Insights Instance.

OVERVIEW
About the TA-mailclient



Author
Oluwaseun Remi-Omosowon




App Version
1.5.4


Vendor Products
poplibimaplibSDK for Python 1.6.14



The TA-mailclient add-on fetches emails for Splunk to index from mailboxes
using either POP3 or IMAP, with or without SSL.
The modular input also stores takes the password from inputs.conf in plain text,
and replaces it with a place holder, while storing it encrypted within Splunk.
This is built using the Splunk SDK for Python, should work on any Splunk
installation with Python available including SHC.
Passwords should also get replicated between search heard peer members.
This only fetches emails from the 'inbox' folder when using POP3. Additional mailbox folders can be indexed when using IMAP.
Be sure to set the interval to run this as frequently as required.
It supports all 'text/*' content types and several well known scripts (.bat, .js, .sh) detailed below:
'application/xml'
'application/xhtml'
'application/x-sh'
'application/x-csh',
'application/javascript'
'application/bat'
'application/x-bat'
'application/x-msdos-program'
'application/textedit'
Images, videos and executables are not indexed.
Scripts and binaries
Includes:
- Splunk SDK for Python (1.6.14)
- Six python 2/3 compatibility (1.15.0)
- mail_lib - supports the calculation of vincenty distances which is used by default
    - constants.py - A number of constants / defaults used throughout the mail_lib module.
    - mail_common.py - Shared functions used to parse emails and attachments
    - exceptions raised by functions used in the mail_lib module.
Release notes
About this release
Version 1.5.4 of the TA-mailclient is compatible with:



Splunk Enterprise versions
8.x, 7.x




CIM
Not Applicable


Platforms
Platform independent


Lookup file changes
No lookups included in this app



This version removes support for unencrypted connections to mailboxes to allow the app pass Splunk Certification. 
The is_secure is no longer required and should be removed from the config.
The administrator is responsible for setting the sourcetype to whatever is desired,
as well as extracting CIM fields for the sourcetype.
This app already includes several extractions for different parts of the message that can be reused.
This app will not work on a universal forwarder,
as it requires Python which comes with an HF or a full Splunk install.
Note: Travis CI includes tests for both secure versions of POP3 / IMAP.

INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
Hardware and software requirements
Hardware requirements
TA-mailclient supports the following server platforms in the versions supported by Splunk Enterprise:

Linux
Windows

The app was developed to be platform agnostic, but tests are mostly run on Linix.
Please contact the developer with issues running this on Windows. See the Splunk documentation for hardware
requirements for running a heavy forwarder.
Software requirements
To function properly, TA-mailclient has no external requirements but needs to be installed on a full Splunk
install which provides python and the required libraries (poplib and imaplib).
Splunk Enterprise system requirements
Because this add-on runs on Splunk Enterprise, all of the Splunk Enterprise system requirements apply.
Download
Download the TA-mailclient at one of the following locaitons:
- Splunkbase
- Github
Installation steps
Deploy to single server instance
To install and configure this app on your supported standalone platform, do one of the following:

Install on a standalone Splunk Enterprise install via the GUI. See Link
Extract the technology add-on to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ and restart Splunk

Deploy to distributed deployment
Install to search head - (Standalone or Search head cluster)

Deploy the props.conf and transforms.conf from TA-mailclient to the search head. 
If using search head cluster, deploy the props.conf and transforms.conf via a search head deployer.

Install to indexers

No App needs to be installed on indexers

Install to forwarders


Follow the steps to install the TA-mailclient on a heavy forwarder.
More instructions available at the following URL


Configure an email input by going to the setup page or configuring inputs.conf.


Deploy to Splunk Cloud
For Splunk cloud installations, install TA-mailclient on a heavy forwarder that has been configured to forward
events to your Splunk Cloud instance. 
The sourcetype is set by the administrator of the heavy forwarder when configuring the inputs.
You can work with Splunk Support on installing the Support add-on on Splunk Cloud for parsing the mails collected.
Configure TA-mailclient
This app adds a mail:// modular input and supports a variety of parameters in inputs.conf.
[mail://email_address@domain.com]
interval = 600
mailserver = imap.domain.com
password = mypassword
protocol = IMAP|POP3
disabled = 0
mailbox_cleanup = delete
additional_folder = test,rfc,spam
Once the input is read, the password gets replaced and shows as 'encrypted'.
As such, the password for the mailbox must not be set to 'encrypted'.
The input can be edited if the password needs to be updated, and the password stored in a password
storage endpoint would get updated automatically. Passwords are never stored in clear text.
A different sourcetype can be specified for each input, thus making it possible to have different sourcetypes
for every mailbox. Mailbox cleanup is also managed automatically, and emails are deleted once it has been
indexed.
Parameters
mailserver - This is a mandatory field and should be the hostname or
IP address for the mail server or client access server with support for retrieving emails via POP3 or IMAP
protocol - This must be set to either POP3 or IMAP
password - Passwords must be set for every account,
or the input will get disabled.
mailbox_cleanup = This indicates if every email should be deleted as it is read,
  or delayed until the next interval.
  Setting this to readonly prevents mails from being deleted.
The default is readonly. Supported options are:
delayed|delete|readonly
interval - This should be configured to run as frequent as required
to retreive emails. This modular input retrieves up to 20 emails at each run.
A future release to this input might allow the limit to be configured as a parameter to the modular input.
This modular input supports multiple instances, and each input runs at separate intervals.
include_headers -  This determines if email headers should be included.
additional_folders - This is an optional parameter containing a comma-separated list of additional folders to be indexed if IMAP is configured for the mailbox.

USER GUIDE
Data types
Data is indexed using a sourcetype specified by the administrator when configuring the inputs.
If nothing is specified, events will get indexed with a sourcetype of mail. 
Troubleshooting
Once an email is indexed, it will not be re-indexed except the checkpoint directory is emptied.
This can be achieved by running the following command:
splunk clean inputdata mail
Diagnostic & Debug Logs
Logs can be found by searching Splunk internal logs
index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd (component=ModularInputs OR component=ExecProcessor) mail.py
Additional logging can be enabled by turning on debug logging for ExecProcessor and ModInputs.
set the logging level of the ExecProcessor to Debug
/opt/splunk/bin/splunk set log-level ExecProcessor -level DEBUG
/opt/splunk/bin/splunk set log-level ModInputs -level DEBUG
You can find additional ways to enable debug logging on

This empowers security teams with a complete view of their external threat landscape and ensures their cybersecurity posture is robust, resilient, and able to counter emerging cyber threats. 
CYFIRMA’s core platform, DeCYFIR, gives security leaders a unified view into six threat pillars – attack surface discovery, vulnerability intelligence, brand intelligence, digital risk discovery, situational awareness, and cyber-intelligence. Based on analysis of threat indicators collected from the deep web, dark web, hacker forums and other closed communities, as well as CYFIRMA’s own research, attacks can be predicted using probability prediction models and analytics engines. By providing threat intelligence from the outside, CYFIRMA can share early warning information when signs of cyber-attacks are detected, enabling cyber teams to take rapid action to thwart attempts at intellectual property theft, ransomware attacks, and other malicious activities.
The CYFIRMA Data Integration Add-On for Splunk helps security teams detect cyberattack campaigns targeting their organization before an intrusion occurs by delivering the following insights:

External attack surface discovery into technology used, process and people to understand the path of attack which cybercriminals can take
Vulnerability intelligence to identify weaknesses in your external facing systems, and connect these to campaign, threat actor, IOCs and more
Brand and digital risk management help defenders understand the digital footprint which could be used to exploit cyber risk in the organization
Situational awareness to understand cyber threat trends in industry, technology and geolocation
Cyber intelligence which can deliver early view into upcoming cyber-crime being planned by cybercriminals (answering who, why, what, when and how)
DeCYFIR would automatically deliver identified threats and alerts into Splunk SIEM and SOAR platform cybersecurity controls to make them more accurate and work more efficiently.

We monitor many active cybercriminals groups and hacking campaigns to provide insights on the intent of cybercriminals such as lateral movement into your environment before a cyberattack happens. This is very key as traditional tools would identity lateral movement only after a threat have entered the environment i.e. network, endpoint, servers and application.
All the above can be directly delivered to your Splunk platform so you can proactively take corrective actions on your various tools such as EDR/NDR/XDR/Intrusion Detection/Perimeter security.",Version 1.0.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/5ad00f24-4866-11ec-9f7e-3221051fe5be.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,23,0,splunk,0,0,Cyfirma Holdings Pte Ltd,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/cyfirmasplunk,"Products: Splunk Enterprise

Splunk App for Corda relies on having direct access to the environment where your Corda nodes are running. As such, you'll need to modify the start up command for your Corda nodes. The startup command is illustrated here. Take note of the new dependencies you'll have, mentioned above. You can find an example of how to obtain and install them here.
In addition to the two java agents, make sure you install the following on your corda node host:
- collectd
- Splunk Universal Forwarder
Refer to the example node dockerfile for how to accomplish the above, or if you already have Splunk App for Infrastructure installed on your Splunk instance, follow the instructions in the App to add more data sources.
Corda Logging Spec (IMPORTANT!)
Splunk App for Corda relies on the Corda node logging in JSON. One of the most important updates you'll need to make to your Corda node startup is to specify a new logging configuration for Log4j2. You can see the full command here. Specifically, you'll find the logging config here, and will specify it like this:
java -Dlog4j.configurationFile=logging.xml -jar corda.jar
Logging arbitrary data
We have implemented a pattern for logging arbitrary data that is illustrated in the CorDapp used in the Docker example. This involves using ThreadContext to put additional strings into your logging context.
You'll need to:
- include log4j2 core in your project.
- import ThreadContext in your workflow.
- put values into your logger ThreadContext.
- remove values from ThreadContext when done.
Splunk considerations
Specify your Splunk host in the following locations:
- On your node host, in the Universal Forwarder outputs.conf
- In the Otel Collector config, here and here.
Specify your Splunk HEC token in the following locations:
- In the Otel Collector config, here and here.
On your Splunk instance
You'll need to add 3 indexes to your Splunk installation.
- name: corda, type: event
- name: traces, type: event
- name: metrics, type: metric
You will want to install our Splunk Apps and Add-ons to make sense of all of the new data being sent to your instance. You can read more about infrastructure monitoring using our Infrastructure Monitoring Tooling here and IT Essentials here.
Architecture / Getting Data In

If you're installing manually in your environment, please consider GDI architecture outline below.
Splunk Configuration

props.conf
You'll need to add an entry in /opt/splunk/etc/system/local/props.conf to tell splunk where to find the timestamp in the Corda JSON logs.
Relevant files: props.conf

Corda Environment

Corda Log4j2 JSON config
Splunk App for Corda relies on the Corda node logging in the JSON format. You will need to specify a log4j2 config to the corda node at runtime.
Relevant files: logging.xml, start_node.sh


OpenTelemetry JavaAgent
The OpenTelemetry JavaAgent (otel-agent.jar) exposes full-fidelity trace data from Corda (operation, timespan). Examples of this include database performance traces and custom traces in CorDapps. The Otel Agent relies on environment variables for configuration and connection info for the Otel Colletor that should be supplied at runtime.
Relevant files: fetch_javaagents.sh, start_node.sh (note the OTEL_* environment variables)


Prometheus JMX JavaAgent
The Prometheus JMX JavaAgent (prometheus-jmx-agent.jar) exposes the JMX metrics from Corda in Prometheus format. The Prometheus JMX JavaAgent relies on a local yaml file for configuration that should be available at runtime. This is mainly formatting rules.
Relevant files: fetch_javaagents.sh, jmx_prometheus_config.yaml, start_node.sh



Additional Services

Splunk Universal Forwarder
The Splunk Universal Forwarder forwards specified log files from the Corda node to Splunk on the port 9997.
Relevant files: install_collectd_and_splunk_uf.sh, fwdr_inputs.conf, start_splunk_uf.sh
Note: Ignore the collectd install if you do not want to collect and send host machine metrics.


OpenTelemetry Collector
The OpenTelemetry Colector (Otel Collector) collects metrics and traces from the OpenTelemetry JavaAgent and the Prometheus JMX JavaAgent running in the JVM with Corda, on ports 4317 and 8080 respectively. The Otel collector sends to Splunk via HEC on port 8088.
Relevant files: install_otel_collector.sh, otel-collector-config.yml, start_otel_collector.sh

This App provides filtering logic (whitelisting) for events in Splunk. It has been originally
developped to migrate from Alert Manager Suppression rule (https://github.com/alertmanager/alert_manager) to Splunk Enterprise Security and not losing the whitelisting work that has been done previously, but you can use Event Masker on every dashboard or query in Splunk search bar.
Event Masker consists in multiple components:

A custom search command (mask). The command take three arguments :
the scope of the mask rule, the scope on the command must match the scope defined in the Event Masker Rules
the log argument (true/t or  false/f) that specifies whether to log or not the masking made by the command. It is true by default.
the timefield argument used only when you set a startDate and endDate to mask events on a specific timerange.
A kv store lookup that contains the masking rules
A masking rules editor
Audit logs to track events that were masked by the command. These logs are pushed daily from the _internal index
   to the _audit index with the help of a scheduled report (mask_command_logs_audit) to benefit from a longer
   retention.
Dashboards to audit the masking and check the masking rules
A workflow action from Enterprise Security to facilitate whitelisting from a notable. It will extract fields from the notable raw in order to fill Event Masker form. 

For documentation, see https://github.com/scrt/event_masker
We also published articles about Event Masker and its features on our blog, see https://blog.scrt.ch/category/analytics-2/
Configuring Splunk
Install this app into Splunk Searh Head (standalone) by doing the following:

Log in to Splunk Web and navigate to ""Apps » Manage Apps"" via the app dropdown at the top left of Splunk's user
   interface
Click the ""install app from file"" button
Upload the file by clicking ""Choose file"" and selecting the app
Click upload

When update this app, please restart Splunk. Some time, you need to refresh Splunk cache (https://<your_splunk_url>/en-US/_bump)
Command usage
Once the app is installed, you can open ""Event Masker"" app from the main launcher. You need to create at least 1 rule to use it.
Once the masking rule has been created, just add the following command at the very end of the Splunk Savedsearch/Correlation search. Transforming command must be used at the left of this command.
index=<index> | table <field1>, <field2> | mask scope=<the_scope_of_the_created_masking_rule>
If you have set startDate and endDate fields, you must set timefield option. You should write the name of your time field with the format %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f.
Example :
index=<index> | table <field1>, <field2>, _time_ | eval _time=strftime(_time,""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f"") |mask scope=<the_scope_of_the_created_masking_rule> timefield=""_time""
The search will be launched and if everything is correct, the events that were to be masking should not appear in the set of results. 
To check that the masking rule and the search have been correctly implemented, go to the Event Masker Logs
dashboard. 
You have to know : If conditions, validity perriod or error occurs, Event Masker return splunk search without modification.
Usage information
By default, you need to be Splunk Admin (admin group) or Enterprise Security Admin (ess_admin group) to see Event Masker and make modifications on rules. To give read-only capabilities to a specific user, you have to add it in Enterprise Security Analyst or User groups (ess_analyst or ess_user). 
To ensure that application logging works as expected, the groups mentioned previously (admin and ess_admin) needs to have the right to write in _internal index. This capability will provide logs regarding modifications made by users on Event Masker rules. 
In Event Masker Rules list (default page):
 Add rule need at least title and scope
 Renaming a rule has no impact in mask command
 To use multiple rule as the same time, you can use the same scope as another rule and use it in mask command
 AND rule need at least 2 conditions
 To edit a rule, click on title field
 ""Start Date"" and ""End date"" are available to filter your events with a specific timerange. You must use timefield option to do that. If you not set these fields, your rule will mask events all the time. 
* Import file must have the following JSON format :
   [
    {
      ""title"": ""rule1"",

          ""value"": ""value2"",
          ""iscasesensitive"": false,

          ""comment"": ""My comment on my condition""
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
Do not forget that fields title, scope and match_type are mandatory (and conditions, of course)
In Event Masker rule editor (edit conditions):
 Right click on the table displays a context menu that enables you to add/delete a row or copy/paste data. You can also save as CSV the table and order data by headers.
 Values can be copied from splunk search result and pasted in the table bellow. This add row automatically.
 Use ""fieldname"" (without quotes) to refer to a field from results
 By default, values are case insensitive
Do not forget : All of the conditions must be true for a valid application. Make sure it works by testing your rules (for example : search * | table myfield | mask scope=""rule scope"")
Known Limitations


Splunk multi-value (MV) field are supported by Event Masker but at this time, masking rule hide the whole line when conditions are matched.


It is possible that importing and exporting takes time and freeze the browser. This will be patched in a future version but for now, take the opportunity to have a coffee :coffee:

Contained within the app are dashboards, lookups and a macro.
The 4 dashboards show -

which gaming rigs have sent data to Splunk within the last 24 hours
real time ""In Car"" details as the car goes around the track. This dashboard can be reached by clicking the game rig in the previous dashboard.
raw telemetry generated by F1 2020 add-on
F1 2020 add-on performance by counting processed events by source, port and host

The lookups enrich the F1 2020 data with additional information such as driver names, team names, track names, etc. Lookups created are based on f1-2020-telemetry packets.py version 0.1.0 which in turn is based on Codemasters F1 2020 UDP Specification including the following exceptions -

lookups with 2 or less rows have not been created
f1_2020_driverId with driverId(s) 100-121 as ""Not Set""
f1_2020_nationality with nationality Id 0 as ""Not Set""

The macro decodes which buttons in the game have been pressed.
The app is designed to be minimal to show example F1 2020 data appearing within Splunk.
Assumptions
The F1 2020 app assumes that all gaming rigs can be uniquely identified with a combination of UDP telemetry port, IP name/address of gaming rig, and data collection IP name/address. If any gaming rigs have the same IP name/address and data collection IP name/address combination ensure the UDP telemetry ports are different for each gaming rig. If this is not possible then the SPL will need to be reworked to consider the header.sessionUID field.
Splunk Setup
After the the app has been installed please restart Splunk.

This TA provides an adaptative response/alert action to create an alert on TheHive.
This App is a version for Splunk Cloud (it can be used on Splunk Enterprise without problem).
The main change with TA_thehive_ce is that this version uses only a lookup table thehive_instance_list.csv instead of creating modular inputs to set the parameters to reach your TheHive instances. 
Installation
This app is designed to run on Splunk Search Head(s) on Linux plateforms
1. Download the app directly on splunkbase or this file which is the Splunk TA ( it is an archive containing the sub-directory TA_thehive_ce)
2. Install the app on your Splunk Search Head(s): ""Manage Apps"" -> ""Install app from file"" or ask Splunk to install it on your Splunk Cloud instance.
3. Restart Splunk (for later updates, you may skip this step)
4. At next logon, launch the app (Manage Apps > TheHive CE > launch app)
5. Configure proxy, logging level
6. Save TheHive Api key value under thehive_api_key1, thehive_api_key2 or thehive_api_key3 input fields
7. With lookup editor or other means, import the CSV table of TheHive instances thehive_instance_list.csv.sample with the name being thehive_instance_list.csv (IMPORTANT for script to work). Please note that you can upload another file provided the column names are the same.
8. Edit this lookup table to point to your TheHive instance(s)
    - provide a name under column 'thehive_instance' - this is the name you are going to use in alert form or sendalert command
    - provide the base URL to your TH instance, ( /api/alert will be added to it to reach the endpoint)
    - indicate the name of the container containing the api key (defined in 6.): either thehive_api_key1 or thehive_api_key2 or thehive_api_key3. Select only one of those 3 constant names (otherwise the script doesn't work)
    - check (or not) the certificate of the TheHive server: use only True or False
    - if applicable, provide the path to the certificate of thehive instance (it implies a check of the certificate)
    - use (or not) the proxy for this instance:: use only True or False
    - provide client certificate if required (and check the box to use it - use only True or False)
6. Parameters are saved under TA_thehive_ce/lookups/thehive_instance_list.csv
7. Important: Role(s)/user(s) configuring this app must have the capability to ""list_storage_passwords"" (as API KEYs and proxy password(s) are safely stored encrypted ). It looks like that this capability is not required to set the alert
8. In addition, a CSV file is saved under lookups/thehive_datatypes.csv. It contains a mapping between field names and datatypes
    - standard datatypes are included at first alert if the file does not exist yet.
    - then you can defined additional field (from datamodel) mapping to datatype e.g. on Splunk field src (from datamodel Web) can be mapped to datatype ip, dest to domain etc.
9. This lookup can be edited to add custom datatypes in the same way.
Use Cases
Here some activities you may carry out more easily with this app.
SOC notable event workflow

Define a correlation search in Splunk 
On match it creates an alert on TheHive
In thehive, an analyst can review it and if appropriate create a case (the template mentioned in Splunk will be used first)

Usage
Splunk alerts to create TheHive alerts

To receive this event stream, on a Splunk Forwarder, the TA configures two of Splunk's raw TCP inputs which listen on the following ports:

4567
4568 (for SSL)

The inputs.conf file included does not define a default index for the input nor does the Add-on create any indices.  If you prefer to have Bricata data routed to a specific index you may create a local copy of the inputs.conf file and customize the input's index routing to your liking.
Bricata's Splunk knowledge objects are bound to the sourcetype defined by the input, bricata:raw, so changes to index routing should have no affect on them. Leveraging the power of Splunk's search-time JSON field extractions, the TA provides the following additional enrichments.

Field Aliases
Eventtypes
Tags

Installation
The TA can be installed by extracting the archive into the /opt/splunk/etc/apps directory and restarting Splunk.  Alternatively it can be installed through the Splunk UI.  
If running a distributed Splunk deployment, The TA should be installed on Splunk Forwarders that will receive the network inputs.

Authors: James Donn, Kristofer Hutchinson and Chhean Saur
The analysis_of_splunkbase_apps allows a Splunk® Enterprise administrator to analyze web site content.  This App also provides examples of:
  Multi-search (the entire App is mostly powered by one search)
  Various form options
  Custom CSS and js
  Custom data collection script
  KV Store
After being asked for a list of Splunk Apps in a spreadsheet a few times, I found a need to build this App.  This App provides a simple dashboard with App stats and allows you to search for Splunk Apps within Splunk. It was also designed to work if you are offline, as long as you have been online once to collect data.
Splunk 6.3+ now has most of this built in, but the offline benefits of this App still make it useful.
This was a collaborative effort:
  James Donn - Dashboards and Searches
  Kristofer Hutchinson - Custom CSS and .js
  Chhean Saur - Data Collection script
Installation steps
To install and configure this app on your supported platform, follow these steps:


Configure the following index within your environment, following your best practices:
[apps]
coldPath = $SPLUNK_DB/apps/colddb
homePath = $SPLUNK_DB/apps/db
thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/apps/thaweddb
frozenTimePeriodInSecs = 604800


Allow time for the script to run to gather data.  If you need it right away, you can restart your Splunk Search Head.


The ""Update Splunk Apps KV Store"" scheduled search needs time to run, but you can also run it manually.

$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/analysis_of_splunkbase_apps/bin/getSplunkAppsV1.py runs every four hours to collect the latest list of Splunk Apps by calling Splunkbase's API.  
New features
Splunk_apps includes the following new features:

The App has been re-written to use a single search to populate almost all dashboards.
The script will now work, no matter how many new Apps are published.
A ""Products"" lookup file is populated by the script.
The dashboards look at the first 10,000 events.  This will need to be updated after there are more than 10,000 Apps ;)
A KV Store makes it lightning fast.
Added ""Splunk Cloud Installation Method"" to the analysis
Audit tab now automatically performs version compatibility checks

Darktrace Connector for Splunk combines Darktrace's award-winning Enterprise Immune System technology, uniquely capable of detecting and responding to the most subtle cyber-threats within the network, with Splunk’s leading operational intelligence platform. Powered by advanced machine learning and AI algorithms, the Enterprise Immune System automatically and adaptively learns the ‘pattern of life’ for every user, device and network, in order to detect emerging behaviours that represent real threats.
The app enhances the Splunk UI by populating it with real-time threat alerts from Darktrace’s self-learning technology, allowing corporations to proactively respond to threats and mitigate risk. The alerts link to detailed reports in the Darktrace Threat Visualizer, allowing for a deep analysis of emerging vulnerabilities and early-stage threats. With straightforward installation and an intuitive dashboard, the Darktrace Connector seamlessly integrates with your existing Splunk interface.

Usage:

The app includes three views:

Edit Conf File
This view for editting/adding conf files at the app level.
Edit System Conf
Edit system-level configuration files.
Normalize Fields
This view is for EVAL and EXTRACT fields in props.conf.

Edit Conf File
This is the general purpose for arbitrary conf files that can be saved either at the user namespace etc/users/{user}/{app}/local/... or at the app namespace etc/apps/{app}/local/...
Some configuration files have been excluded from the dropdown as they are only valid to be saved under the system namespace. These can be edited using the System Conf File page. However, the list used is not guaranteed to be exhaustive, so some conf files might fail to save (or not show up at all) using both this app conf editor and the system conf editor. In this case, and any other case of repeated failure to save, assume this app will be unable to edit such files.

The Conf Details page allows for selecting from a list of configuration files available in the Splunk instance (a new file can also be added). All changes are made to the whole stanza at a time. The app context and sharing settings determine the directory and visibility, respectively, of the properties that are modified in the file.
For example, after selecting the following:
- ""tags"" file (tags.conf)
- stanza: ""test""
- app context of ""Conf Editor""
- sharing of ""app""
Changes will be written to the path:
$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/conf_editor/local/tags.conf
And the file will look like so:
...

[host=test]
<key>=<value>
<key2>=<value2>
Notes


It is important to be familiar with the required format for each conf file. The UI does not run any validation on the values. Read the Splunk manual


The editor will allow creating new stanzas that might not be valid (but nevertheless allowed through the Splunk REST api).

For example, the stanza [source*] is not valid, (wild card). No fields will be matched in searches (this is a search-time error) but the editor UI will not report any error during creation.

Normalize Fields
This page allows adding, update and deleting fields (EVAL and EXTRACT only) in props.conf for a specific app or sharing context. 
This app does not support (nor does it make changes to) fields defined using the TRANSFORM directive.
Changes to the props.conf file are made only by calling the respective REST api endpoints (for editing and setting acl) on knowledge objects. 

Configuration
The app includes a custom configuration (conf-editor-settings.conf).
There's currently only one relevant stanza in the configuration file.
[field-list] defines the optional and mandatory fields, it has keys:
- optional - fields to be listed as optional category in the UI.
- mandatory - fields to be listed as mandatory in the UI.
Both keys expect a comma separated list of values. There's a default list that matches the ITSI fields. Read more here.
This list determines the suggested field in the Normalize Fields page.
Notes


The app includes a default web.conf with two expose directives, this is required in order to be able to access the REST endpoints that allow making changes to props.conf. This means a Splunk restart is required (after app installation) before using the Normalize Fields


When a new stanza is created in props.conf under Normalize Fields. Deleting all the keys for the stanza may not automatically delete that stanza.


For example, if the following were created.
[new-stanza]
key=value
And the key=value property was deleted.
The prop.conf file will look like so:
[new-stanza]
This is intentional for now, as there might be other properties created under the stanza that the app does not make changes to (i.e a TRANSFORM-{} property)

Edit System Conf:
This page is specifically for configurations files withing that can only be saved at the system level (instead of app/user namespace).
The configuration selection dropdown is mutually exclusive with that show in the regular conf editor page. The web.conf file is the only configuration file that appears on both.
Using the system conf editor requires a lot more comfort and knowledge with configuration files.
Because they are at the system level some of the conf files control instance-level settings like maximum memory usage. 
Be sure to familiarize yourself with the configuration file you wish to change before using the page. 
Use the Splunk Admin manual when in doubt.

No guidance or guarantee is provided in the UI for valid or recommended values.

Notes

Because of how Splunk loads changes to configuration files, most of the files available to edit here require a restart before the changes will actually be applied within Splunk.

Because of how the api the UI uses for managing conf files. The page might show old/default values for a certain key after it has been updated/saved. This doesn't mean the respective changes in system/local have not been made - it just means Splunk hasn't loaded it yet. Read the documentation for each configuration to determine if a restart is required for Splunk to pick up changes.


To minimize invalid stanzas and key/value pairs. Only pre-existing stanzas and keys will be shown. 

New stanzas cannot be created.
New keys cannot be added and existing key names cannot be changed.

General Notes And Troubleshooting


Changes are never made to default configuration files (in the default directory), edits are only applied to local conf files, the file(s) will be created if it doesn't already exist. Read more about Splunk configuration files


The editor makes use of the current user's authenticated session to make REST api calls. If the current user does not have the proper permissions to view or edit to files, then the file might not appear, be disabled or fail to save, depending on the acl rules. 


Any errors relating authentication requests are also linked to the current browser session. Authenticated sessions might be invalidated when using an ""Incognito/Private"" window. Refreshing the tab should fix the issue, otherwise use a regular browser window when possible to avoid errors with sessions and cookies.",Version 0.3.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/a9924f58-8cca-11eb-92f2-025a6208ee83.png,Utilities,https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-general-terms.html,636,0,splunk,3,4,Splunk Works,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/splunklabs,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/455,2022-01-10,08:24:57 AM,xmlutils,,"Dec. 2, 2020","xmlutils provides a few commands for working with xml documents. xmlkv and xpath can accomplish most tasks, these are simply alternatives.
These commands will work on a field called ""xml"" if found, otherwise _raw.
xmlprettyprint
xmlprettyprint does what you would expect, pretty printing the xml.
xmlsplit
xmlsplit splits nodes into new events, copying other fields on the event to the new events.
Examples:
Given this xml:
<a><b>foo</b><b>bar</b></a>
xmlsplit field=""b""
will create two events:
<b>foo</b>  
<b>bar</b>
xmlkvrecursive
xmlkvrecursive recursively builds fields from the tag and attribute names. The optional boolean flatten determines how repeated fields are treated. By default, repeated field names will be appended into a multi-value field. With flatten=""true"", new fields will be created.
Examples:
sourcetype=* | head 1 | eval _raw=""<a la='sdf'><b>foo</b><b>bar</b></a>"" | xmlkvrecursive
produces:
a-la = sdf  
a_b = [foo,bar]
sourcetype=* | head 1 | eval _raw=""<a la='sdf'><b>foo</b><b>bar</b></a>"" | xmlkvrecursive flatten=true
produces:
a-la = sdf  
a_b = foo  
a_b[2](http://splunkbase.splunk.com/wiki/2) = bar
Most of the time, xpath or xmlkv would be more appropriate. This command is useful if you need to extract multiple fields that are not extracted easily using one of those commands.
xmlstripdeclaration
xmlstripdeclaration removes the <?xml declaration from the beginning of the xml. This is needed if the declaration is incorrect and the parser used by the other commands would refuse to continue.",Version 1.2,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/image/default_icon.png,Utilities,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,"1,872",0,splunk,5,5,Vincent Bumgarner,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/vbumgarner,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

But many organizations are still flying blind, with no easy way to derive operational intelligence from the vast amounts of machine data generated by these critical systems.
It’s time for data streams from the mainframe to be as accessible as your other data streams when it comes to analytics for business intelligence and security monitoring.
Ironstream enables you to collect and forward mainframe log data, including security data, into Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security and Splunk IT Service Intelligence where you can get that true 360-degree view.
Users can then easily search, analyze, and visualize the data for powerful business intelligence reporting -- without needing specialized expertise and different monitoring systems for mainframe.
Make more sense of the valuable machine data hidden away on your mainframe.

This visualisation will show connected arcs on a map. Each arc is defined by two geographic points, and can have a color assigned. Additionally the arcs can be animated, with the pulsing animation being either at the start or the end of the arc.
Globally, the arc thickness, default color and map tileset can be chosen, as well as the starting map position and zoom.
This visualisation is based upon leaflet.migrationLayer by react-map: https://github.com/react-map/leaflet.migrationLayer
Some use cases could be:

Show data replication links between sites and their status
Show a representation of incoming attacks or requests

Note: If any lines are animated this will result in heightened browser CPU usage.
Search and data formatting
The visualisation looks for fields of the following names:

start_lat: The starting point latitude (required)
start_lon: The starting point longitude (required)
end_lat: The ending point latitude (required)
end_lon: The ending point latitude (required)
color: The color of the arc in hex format (optional, default ""#FF0000"")
animate: Whether to animate this arc (optional, default ""false"")
pulse_at_start: When animated, set to true to cause the pulse to be at the start of the arc instead of the end (optional, default ""false"")
weight: The line weight of the arc (optional, default 1).

The fields must be named in this way, but they are not order dependent.
An example dataset is distributed as a lookup to experiment with.
| inputlookup missilemap_testdata
Customisation options
The following options are available to customise:

Lines
Default color: The color to use for a line when no ""color"" field is present in the data (default: #65a637)
Weight: The weight to use for a line when no ""weight"" field is present in the data (default: 1)


Map
Tile set: The map tiles to use
Custom tile set: If you wish to use a tile set not in the preset list (e.g. http://tile.stamen.com/toner/{z}/{x}/{y}.png)
Latitude: Starting latitude to load
Longitude: Starting longitude to load
Zoom: Starting zoom level to load

Q: I'm searching last week, how come my weekly results seem to start on Monday?
A: This is not an error.  Timewap relies on the timeframe of the search.  You are searching for a 7 day window FROM sunday.  That's mon,tues,wed,thurs,fri,sat,sun.  If you want to start on Sunday, end your search on Saturday @w-1.
Q: I searched for day over day for a week, but I get 8 lines charted.  Why not 7?
A: If you are searching last seven 24 hour periods, which will occur on 8 days, unless you start at midnight. If snap to the start of a day, this will go away.
Q: How can I compare Wednesdays to Wednesdays?
A: Do your search as usual, and filter at the end (filtering up-front will confuse timechart):
.... | timechart count span=1h | timewrap w | where strftime(_time, ""%A"") == ""Wednesday""

Q: How can I change the names of the series?
A: There is now a new ""series"" option to determines the naming convention of the series names: 

""relative"" gives values like ""latest_week"", ""1week_ago"", ""2weeks_ago"", etc.; 
""short"" gives short span names like ""s0"", ""s1"", ""s2"", etc., which are useful if you need to modify the values with further search commands; 
""exact"" gives convenient values like ""week_of_dec01"", ""week_of_nov24"",  etc. 

""relative"" is the default ""series"" value.
Q: How can I compare today to yesterday to the avg for the week?
Glad you asked. Search for the last 7 days and run this:
*  
| timechart count span=1h
| timewrap  d series=short
| addtotals s*
| eval 7dayavg=Total/7.0
| table _time, _span, s0, s1, 7dayavg
| rename s0 as now, s1 as yesterday

Basically, we're using timewrap over the last 7 days, and then using addtotals and eval to calculate the average over those 7 days.  We then rename fields and cut out days 3-7, because we only wanted today, yesterday, and the weekly average.
Q: What is this 'drilldown' command you threw in for nothing?
Currently in Splunk you cannot drilldown into ""other"" values from a ""top"" command.  For example, if you searched for ""* | top 10 host useother=t"", clicking on the ""other"" value will try to search for ""host=other""(!), which is wrong.
I added a little search command that adds a _drilldown field that does the right thing -- it will search for ""host=* NOT host=VAL1 NOT host=VAL2 ... NOT host=VAL3"".  It works with 'top' output.

Search head deployer
Yes
Install this add-on on your search head deployer to enable CIM compliance of DMARC aggregate reports on a Search Head Cluster


Cluster Master
No
This add-on should be installed on a heavy forwarder that performs parsing at index time. There is no need to install this add-on on an indexer too.


Deployment Server
Depends
This add-on can be (1) deployed unconfigured to a client or (2) deployed preconfigured with a directory input. Due to the encrypted credentials it cannot be deployed preconfigured for IMAP inputs.



Configure inputs for TA-dmarc
The TA-dmarc supports the following input modes:

Read aggregate reports from an IMAP account. The add-on only ingests mails with ""Report domain:"" in the subject. It leaves the ingested mails on the IMAP server and keeps a record of which mails have already been processed.
Read aggregate reports from a directory. This can be useful to batch load the aggregate reports in non-internet-connected environments.

Directory input
TA-dmarc can watch a folder where you drop DMARC aggregate reports manually or otherwise.
It will read files with .xml, .zip or .xml.gz extention, ingest them into Splunk. Any invalid .xml, .zip or .xml.gz files are ignored. 
TA-dmarc will leave files untouched in the directory: it uses internal checkpointing to skip files that have been previously ingested.

Go to the add-on's configuration UI and configure a new modular input by clicking on the ""Inputs"" menu.
Click ""Create new input""
Select ""DMARC directory""
Configure:
Name: e.g. ""production_dmarc_indir""
Interval: how often to poll the directory where DMARC XML aggregate reports are read from (see below)
Index: what Splunk index to send the aggregate reports to
Directory: Location where DMARC aggregate reports should be read from
Quiet time: Ignore files that have a modification time of less than n seconds ago. You can use this to prevent ingesting large files that are dropped on a network share but take some time to transfer
Resolve IP: Whether or not to resolve the raw source_ip in the DMARC XML aggregate reports
Click add

IMAP input
TA-dmarc can fetch DMARC aggregate report attachments from mails on an IMAP server. It will process attachments in .xml, .zip or xml.gz format and ingest them into Splunk.
TA-dmarc will leave the mails on the server: it uses internal checkpointing to skip mails that have been previously ingested.

Go to the add-on's configuration UI and configure an account to authenticate with:
Account Name: descriptive account name, e.g. google_dmarc_mailbox
Username: the account to identify with
Password: the password to authenticate with
Next, go to the add-on's configuration UI and configure a new modular input by clicking on the ""Inputs"" menu.
Click ""Create new input""
Select ""DMARC mailbox""
Configure:
Name: e.g. dmarc-google
Interval: how often to poll the mailserver for aggregate reports.
Index: what Splunk index to send the aggregate reports to
Global Account: select the account to authenticate with
IMAP server: the imap server to poll
Use SSL: whether or not to use an encrypted connection
Resolve IP: Whether or not to resolve the row source_ip in the DMARC XML aggregate reports

DMARC aggregate reports
This add-on handles the following file formats in which aggregate reports are delivered:

XML (as .xml file)
ZIP (as .zip file)
GZ (as .xml.gz file)

Mitigations are in place against:

ZIP bombs
gzip bombs
various XML attack vectors like billion laughs, quadratic blowup, external entity expansion and so on

Advanced
The DMARC-imap input saves checkpointing data in KVstore.
To see its contents: |inputlookup ta_dmarc_checkpointer_lookup
If you want to reindex an entire mailbox, you can do so by deleting the TA-dmarc KVstore checkpointing data through this Splunk command: 
|inputlookup ta_dmarc_checkpointer_lookup
|search state!=""*input=dmarc_imap, server=imap.gmail.com*""
|outputlookup ta_dmarc_checkpointer_lookup`
If you want to reindex a single DMARC report, you can do so by deleting its corresponding record from KVstore:
| inputlookup ta_dmarc_checkpointer_lookup 
| search state!=""*Report-ID: 3596274322387252907*"" 
| outputlookup ta_dmarc_checkpointer_lookup
Reindexing a DMARC report from a directory input is left as an excercise for the reader.

You can control which issues to index by specifying a JQL query string.
Example:
project = SD AND updated > -15m

this JQL query string matches all issues in the service desk (SD) project that have been updated during the last 15 minutes

Why you should not use Jira Issues Collector Add-on
The Add-on Jira Issues Collector does not support API pagination. That means if your JQL query string returns more than the maximum allowable value defined by the Jira property jira.search.views.default.max, which defaults to 100, you will loose data.
This TA supports API pagination and adds some additional functionalities!
Configuration

Setup the Jira Account by going to the configuration page of the TA-jira_issue_input app: Configuration -> Account

Account Name | Unique name of the account
Jira Server | Jira Server Hostname (without http(s)://)
Verify Jira Server Certificate | Whether the Jira server certificate should be verified
Username | Jira REST API username
Password | Jira REST API password


(Optional) Setup a proxy to use for the requests to the Jira REST API: Configuration -> Proxy


Add your Jira issue input on the app Inputs configuration page


Name | Unique name of the data input (this also represents the source field)
Interval | Time interval of input in seconds
Index | The destination index in which the Jira issue data will be stored
Jira Account | The Jira account configured in step 1
JQL (Jira Query Language) | The JQL query string defines which issues to collect

StreamWeaver on the AWS MarketPlace 
The full-featured dashboard allows you to visualize your AppDynamics, Dynatrace, and New Relic APM data directly inside your Splunk instance where you can apply advanced or predictive analytics. If you want to integrate just one of these tools, there are applications available for them individually. Here are some of the reasons why our customers chose StreamWeaver:

Radically increase service availability by consolidating all your siloed monitoring data together from any cloud and any premise
Integrate monitoring data from anywhere; on-prem, cloud or hybrid to finally achieve AIOps initiatives
Rapidly migrate to the cloud, with confidence, because your monitoring tools will continue to work in a hybrid environment
Reduce the cost and effort of building and maintaining integrations by a factor of 10 (or more)
Free up expensive and overcommitted development resources from low-value integration work
Innovate faster through quicker adoption of new monitoring technologies because you don’t have to worry about integration, and integrating new tools will be significantly easier

Highlighted Features: 

Point-and-click connectivity. No coding required
Data mediation and normalization. Seamless integration of metric, event, log, and topology data between source and destination tools that were not natively designed to work together
Real-time distributed streaming architecture. Bi-directional data flows that ensure all systems are synchronized
Guaranteed delivery and data throttling 
Hybrid-cloud ready. Local data extraction from multiple clouds and secure, reliable data transmission
Enterprise-grade scalability and never the bottleneck
High Availability 
No prior knowledge of source system needed requiring little or no time from the source destination owner

Support
For support and questions, please e-mail analytics@cloudflare.com
Application Requirements


Splunk Enterprise version 8.x-7.x 


Cloudflare logs are expected to be in JSON format with a sourcetype of cloudflare:json


Cloudflare Logs Onboarding Notes


For documentation on the available methods for collecting Cloudflare logs please refer to the Cloudflare Logs developer documentation here.


For ease of onboarding and integration, it is recommended to use Cloudflare’s Logpush Service to push logs to Amazon S3, which can then be pulled into Splunk using the Splunk Add-on for AWS. Instructions on how to install the Splunk Add-on for AWS and configure inputs can be found here – this link also contains details on where to install the Splunk Add-on for AWS as it is dependent on the type of deployment you have.


Please note that if you are performing the data onboarding from a separate instance of Splunk and not where the Cloudflare App for Splunk is located, it is strongly advised to copy the proper section of the props.conf packaged with the Cloudflare App for Splunk to the instance which is collecting the Cloudflare JSON data.


By default, within the application JSON key-value extraction is turned on at search time by setting KV_MODE in the props.conf packaged with the application to json. If you happen to set up INDEXED_EXTRACTIONS for the cloudflare:json sourcetype at the point of which you are onboarding data, then you will need you need to set KV_MODE=none in the props.conf packaged with the application to ensure field values are not extracted twice and thus impacting the dashboards.


Application Installation Instructions
The Cloudflare App for Splunk is easy to install and configure. Please follow the steps below to install and configure the application within your Splunk environment.  


Ensure the Application Requirements documented above are met.


Download the application from Splunkbase.


Install the application on your Search Head or Search Head Cluster using standard application deployment methods. Information on installing applications on Splunk can be found in the Splunk documentation here.


Once installed the application needs to be configured. A Set Up page is bundled with the application. To configure the application following these steps:


Access the application on your Search Head by clicking on the “Cloudflare App for Splunk” from your Splunk launcher home page or from the Apps dropdown menu. You will be prompted with the application Set Up screen.


Enter the Index name where the Cloudflare JSON logs are stored. This value must be entered in the format index=index_name. By default the value is set to index=cloudflare


Choose whether to enable Data Model Acceleration. By default, acceleration is disabled.

The application is now installed and can be found on your Splunk launcher home page or through the Apps dropdown menu to the top left.



Post-Installation Notes:


The Index Name can be changed after initial configuration by accessing the App Set Up page by clicking on Apps dropdown > Manage Apps > Cloudflare Set Up. The Index Name can also be manually found by going to Settings > Advanced search > Search macro within the Cloudflare App for Splunk.


The Cloudflare App for Splunk comes with a custom Cloudflare Data Model which has an acceleration time frame of 1 Day but is not accelerated by default. If you enable Data Model acceleration it is recommended that the Data Model is only accelerated for 1 or 7 days to ensure there are no adverse effects within your Splunk environment. You can enable or disable acceleration after initial configuration by accessing the App Set Up page by clicking on Apps dropdown > Manage Apps > Set Up link to the right of Cloudflare. Data Models can also be manually configured by going to Settings > Data models. More information on data model acceleration can be found here.",Version 1.0.3,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/def65db8-097d-11eb-b511-0281150c11dc.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance, DevOps",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,"2,451",0,splunk,5,5,"Cloudflare, Inc",https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/cloudflare,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

target_field:
 - The field to create and set
 - Required
pointer:
 - The field that contains the name of the field with the value we want to set target_field to.
 - Required
 - If the field doesn't exist on the event the default is used
ptrFieldFilter:
 - This option can accept basic patterns for mattching with a *, no other wildcard characters are available.
 - Multiple field/field patterns can be specified using pipes: ""Field*|OtherPattern*|*_MySuffix""
 - Optional, default value is * (all fields)
 - Warning: Performance over large datasets almost requires you to specify the ptrFieldFilter option.  This list should only contain field names that 'pointer' can point to.
default:
 - Optional, default value is """"

Using this app in conjunction with the Splunk integration snippet on NEQTO devices, you can gain key insights about the incoming data flow from individual devices. It is also possible to visualize the collective flow from a fleet of devices.KEY FEATURES: 1. You can have remote control. NEQTO Console REST API and NEQTO Console put all your deployed IoT devices at your fingertips so that you can control devices whenever, wherever, and in any quantity. Easily reboot devices, reload scripts, send custom commands, and more.2. The NEQTO Console makes managing IoT deployments easy. Time-consuming on-boarding processes, such as managing security certificates and encryption keys for devices/cloud, are handled automatically. We cut development time from years to months, or even days or minutes. 3. Keeping the firmware and scripts on IoT devices up-to-date is an important part of IoT system's operations. Updates can fix security issues or provide new features that make better use of the hardware. NEQTO Firmware can be downloaded and updated remotely. Our machine Driver feature is used to keep all connected devices up to date and secure.

This app provides field extraction, cim mapping(authentication) for CA Privileged Access Manager (PAM) in Splunk.
The field extraction accepts both Splunk native tcp/udp connections and rsyslog style syslog.
CA PAM supports both syslog and xsuite for Splunk, we do recommend use syslog which contains more information for investigation purpose.
Configuring Rsyslog
The timestamp of syslog format from CA PAM is not aligned. If you use rsyslog, you can reconfigure your rsyslog.conf as following:
For Redhat 8:
#module(load=""builtin:omfile"" Template=""RSYSLOG_TraditionalFileFormat"")
$template CustomFormat,""%timegenerated% %HOSTNAME% %syslogtag%%msg:::sp-if-no-1st-sp%%msg:::drop-last-lf%\n""
module(load=""builtin:omfile"" Template=""CustomFormat"")
For Redhat 7:
#$ActionFileDefaultTemplate RSYSLOG_TraditionalFileFormat
$template CustomFormat,""%timegenerated% %HOSTNAME% %syslogtag%%msg:::sp-if-no-1st-sp%%msg:::drop-last-lf%\n""
$ActionFileDefaultTemplate CustomFormat
Configuring Splunk
This app need to install on Splunk Search Head.
Install this app into Splunk by doing the following:

Log in to Splunk Web and navigate to ""Apps » Manage Apps"" via the app dropdown at the top left of Splunk's user interface
Click the ""install app from file"" button
Upload the file by clicking ""Choose file"" and selecting the app
Click upload
Restart Splunk if a dialog asks you to

Configure the input sourcetype as ca:pam:syslog.
Useful macros
We do provided different useful macros which can correlate different logs. This is the most powerful part of this apps. You should explore those macros. Those name of macros are starting with CA_PAM*.
Also, we have provided some example inside macros.conf, you can extend the power by defining the correct lookup files and AD domain.
If there is any performance issues when using those macros, you can consider install this app on Heavy Forwarder/Indexer, create a new index, and enable TRANSFORMS-index_ca_pam inside props.conf and transforms.conf.",Version 1.0.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/716b503e-5d08-11ec-99e9-766bccb1cabb.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,21,0,splunk,5,1,CyberSecThreat Developer,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/cybersecthreat,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

The Iguana Web Analytics Support Add-on for Adobe® Analytics is designed to help users gain insights on Adobe ClickStream data, particularly surrounding traffic dimentions, customers and their shopping activities, and other key web intelligence.
This Support Add-on (SA) contains search time extractions, macros, key-value store collections and other Splunk objects which are required for synthesizing the Adobe ClickStream data and building knowledge objects.
This SA is a support application for its base, Iguana Web Analytics App for Splunk. Hence this application should be installed along with the following apps:

Iguana Web Analytics App for Splunk
Iguana Web Analytics Technical Add-on for Adobe Analytics

Installation
The installation of Iguana Web Analytics Support Add-on for Adobe Analytics follows the standard Splunk app installation procedure. There are no additional post-configuration steps required to have this SA be functional.
Limitations
This SA should be deployed on single-instance installation of Splunk. This instance should also have the base application, Iguana Web Analytics App for Splunk, deployed.
NOTE: Currently, single-instance installation of Splunk is the only supported method. Support for distributed environment will be made available in a future release of the application.
Usages
Once this SA is deployed, navigate to ""Market Intelligence"" from the menu within Iguana Web Analytics App for Splunk. Within this menu, a section called ""Adobe ClickStream"" will now be made available, making specific dashboards and reports now visible.

The events are automatically categorized as follows:
Multisession Analysis
High Priority Events
IDS Events
Network Logs (3rd party logs sent to the sensors)
File Transmission Analysis
User Discovery
Service Discovery
Host Discovery
Mac Discovery
Suspicious URL Transmission Analysis
IPS Notifications
User Rankings
Modsecurity
Events volumes are also broken down by addresses, ports and other important invariants like sensor names, domains types, applications, etc.. It is possible to click on all summary records fileds to either drilldown on Splunk or drill down on the MetaFlows' web application to obtain more detailed forensic information like packets payloads.
Splunk app Installation
-- App Installtion --
The app is available from SplunkWeb[2]. Please download and install the application using your Splunk application manager. The app receives syslog messages on tcp port 3015 encapsulated using SSL. The default installation includes a generic self-signed SSL certificate in the cert directory. This certifcate was generated using the commands:
         export OPENSSL_CONF=$SPLUNK_HOME/openssl/openssl.cnf
        $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/genRootCA.sh -d $SPLUNKHOME/etc/apps/SplunkforMetaFlows/certs
        $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/genSignedServerCert.sh -d $SPLUNKHOME/etc/apps/SplunkforMetaFlows/certs -n splunk -p
We recommend you generate a new SSL ceritificate using your own phassphrase by repeating the commands above.
The passphrase you enter when generating the certificate should then be placed in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SplunkforMetaFlows/default/inputs.conf under the [SSL] stanza as:
        password = <yourpassword>
-- Sensor Configuration --
In order for Splunk to receive MetaFlows's sensors event you need to add the following line to your /nsm/etc/mss.sh startup script
export SYSLOG2=<splunk_host_ip_address>:3015
where <splunk_host_ip_address> is the ip address of the host where Splunk is running. After this, restart your sensor(s) with the command
/nsm/etc/mss.sh restart
Make sure that tcp port 3015 is open and the sensor can communicate with your Splunk host.",Version 1.2,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/e922c5e6-5b8a-11e7-8384-02f13bdc2585.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html,260,0,splunk,0,0,Livio Ricciulli,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/livioricciulli,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

Four Dashboards:

Trends shows four panels with operational overviews of your dhcpd trends, including top and rare MAC address vendors
Templates allows you to search your dhcpd data without getting in to the complexities of the Splunk search language
Trends (RT) shows the same basic visualizations as the above Trends dashboard but updates in real time
Transactions (RT) shows dhcpd transactions grouped together by IP address

MAC Prefix-to-Vendor Mapping

Splunk for DHCPD uses a static lookup built from IEEE information to automatically map MAC address prefixes to MAC address vendors

14 Saved Searches

Splunk for DHCPD comes with fourteen saved searches that power dashboards, alerts, reports, and real-time trends.

26 Event Types

Splunk for DHCPD comes with twenty-six event types that help you understand what each dhcp event means and powers several visualizations

Base-lining and Anomaly Detection

Splunk for DHCPD compiles a lookup of all known MAC address, IP address, and MAC vendor combinations to form a baseline for your network, and will email you every time a previously unseen host appears on the network.

CEF-Ready

Splunk for DHCPD ships with all the plumbing required to output CEF-formatted events in combination with our forthcoming real-time routing framework

Getting Started
To get started with the Splunk for DHCPD, please perform the following configuration:
Permissions
By default, permissions are set at the app level - users in the 'admin' role have read and write permissions, while users in the 'dhcpd' role have read-only permissions.
You can change the app level permissions by navigating to Manager >> Apps >> dhcp ""Permissions"". Use caution!
Field Extractions
To ensure that field extractions are working properly, you will need to ensure that the correct source type is linked to the field extractions and lookups.
By default, the app will already work if your dhcpd events are coming in under the source types ""syslog"" or ""dhcpd"".
Otherwise, you should copy $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/dhcpd/default/props.conf to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/dhcpd/local/props.conf, and change one of the existing stanzas ([dhcpd] or [syslog]) to the source type that your dhcpd data is in while deleting the other props.conf stanza.
For example, to set the field extractions and lookups to work with the source type foobar, $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/dhcpd/local/props.conf should look as follows:
[foobar]
TRANSFORMS-dhcpd=set-dhcpd-sourcetype
REPORT-dhcpd=dhcpack_type1,dhcpack_type2,dhcpnak,dhcprequest,dhcpdiscover,dhcpoffer,dhcpinform,dhcprelease,dhcp_forward_map_failed,dhcp_added_reverse_map,dhcp_added_forward_map,dhcp_removed_reverse_map,dhcp_leases,dhcp_decls,dhcp_deleted_decls,dhcp_dyn_plus_stat_line1,dhcp_dyn_plus_stat_line2,dhcp_dyn_plus_stat_line3,dhcp_rrset_no_exists,dhcp_rrset_exists,dhcp_duplicate,dhcp_abandon_ip,dhcp_icmp_reply_lease_valid,dhcp_xing_on,src_mac_prefix
LOOKUP-dhcpd=dhcpd_mac-vendorname src_mac_prefix OUTPUT src_mac_vendor
LOOKUP-dhcpd=dhcpd_cef-lookup eventtype OUTPUT cef_version cef_dvendor cef_dproduct cef_dversion cef_sid cef_name cef_severity

Saved Searches
Most of the saved searches and dashboards depend on the event type ""dhcpd_event"" being defined correctly. By default, this event type is defined as ""process=dhcpd"", so if you have performed the initial step of getting the field extractions to work, you should be all set. If you still have problems, please post to answers.splunk.com using the link on this page.
Alerts
The alert ""dhcpd_alert_new_mac_address_15m"" will email you when a new host shows up on your network. The results contained in this alert will be fairly verbose the first few times that it runs, as it takes a while for a baseline to be established, so you might want to consider disabling the action to send you an email for a day or two.
In any case, you will want to change the ""Email address(es)"" from ""example@example.com"" to your desired email address or distribution list.",Version 1.3,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/6d680fea-6900-11e3-b4de-005056ad5c72.png,IT Operations,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/,"3,447",0,splunk,1,1,Alex Raitz,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/araitz,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

The Splunk Add-on for Recorded Future is designed specifically for Splunk Enterprise Security.
This Add-on integrates with the Splunk ES Threat Intelligence Framework by adding a feed containing information security threat indicators from Recorded Future. With this added feature, defenders can automate the process of finding connections between internal incidents and external sources. This can work bidirectionally: searching Recorded Future for more context around internally observed indicators, or testing trending indicators from open source reporting against internal data sets.
The Add-on also simplifies the workflow of analysts working within the ES environment by adding contextual actions to the Incident Review and event searching and reporting views. This includes information on IPs, domains, file hashes and CVEs.
For more information on Recorded Future, visit www.recordedfuture.com.
Requirements

Splunk ES must be installed on the Splunk system
A valid Recorded Future API token is required.
The Splunk server running the app must be able to download a CSV
    file containing Recorded Future's IP risk list from
https://api.recordedfuture.com/.

Installing and configuring
Installation
To install this Add-on, perform the following steps:

Download the latest TA release from Splunkbase (apps.splunk.com)
In Splunk, select ""Manage Apps"" from the drop-down menu next
       to the Splunk logo on the upper left of the screen
Select ""Install app from file""
Browse to the location of the TA-recorded_future.spl file,
     select it and upload. Restart Splunk when prompted to do so.
In the Enterprise Security menu bar,
     click Configure → Incident Management → Incident Review Settings.

Click the button 'Add new entry' in the ""Incident Review -
     Event Attributes"" section. Add the following Label and Field
     combinations:
| Label                           | Field
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| RF Risk Score                   | rf_a_risk               |
| RF Triggered Rules              | rf_b_rules              |
| RF Very Malicious Evidence      | rf_evidence_critical    |
| RF Malicious Evidence           | rf_evidence_malicious   |
| RF Suspicious Evidence          | rf_evidence_suspicious  |
| RF Unusual Evidence             | rf_evidence_unusual     |



A restart of the Splunk instance will be required once the
      installation has completed.

If you haven't already done so, enable the Enterprise
      Security correlation search called ""Threat Activity Detected"" 
In the Enterprise Security menu bar, click Configure → Content Management
In the filter bar, type ""Threat Activity Detected""
Click the link 'Enable' to enable the correlation search


Optionally, create a post install verification report. Run the
     ""Validate app deployment"" report. It will perform a number of
     tests, none of which should yield an error.
Go to Dashboards, Reports... → Reports.
Run Validate app deployment.



Alternatively, you can download the Add-on using the Splunk Web
interface's ""Find more apps online"" feature. Steps 5 and onwards above
must still be completed.
Configuration
After installation, you will need to set up the Add-on for Recorded
Future to communicate with the Recorded Future API. 

Go to Configuration → Configuration.
Select the Add-on Settings tab.
Enter the API Key.
Review the other tabs if additional configuration is required.

Upgrading from previous versions
The setup needs to be run after the upgrade. The API key (previously
called token in our documentation) will not carry over from the old
configuration. The same goes for proxy and loglevel configurations.
Upgrade from 3.x versions
Due to the extent of the changes between version 2 and 3 of the app
  we recommend that you remove the app directory
  ($SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-recorded_future) and make a fresh install
  of the app.
If that is not possible proceed with the instructions below.
Files and directories that can be removed
The following files and directories can be removed 
since they are not used anymore:
From the bin folder:
future
libfuturize
past
requests
rf_integrations
rf_splunk
rfapi
splunklib
get-rf-threatlists.py
rf_es_setup.py
verify_rf_app.py
From the local folder (if present):
commands.conf
From the local/data/ui/nav folder (if present):
default.xml
Files that must be reviewed
Any file in the local folder is the result of a 
local configuration. These have precedence over the
new settings shipped with the app. Review differences 
in each file in the local folder compared to the
new default in the default folder and adjust if 
required.
In particular correlation searches in 
savedsearches.conf are likely to cause issues if
in place.

Twilio App for Splunk helps you ingest Twilio logs into Splunk. This app comes prebuilt with searches powering a number of dashboards and alerts for the ingested log data. It also provides Twilio SMS alerting functionality via Splunk's scripted alert triggers.
What's included
1 x Index (twilio)
4 x Prebuilt Dashboards (call center, call stats, sms center, billing)
*1 x Prebuilt Alert (billing)
Installation
Download this app from Splunkbase then upload the tar.gz file to Splunk.
Log Input Config
1) Download your Twilio call and SMS logs
Twilio provides an easy way to access your call and SMS logs using the web interface.
Download your Twilio call logs here.
Download your Twilio SMS logs here.
Protip: Place both files in a folder together.
2) Upload these files to Splunk
Navigate to: Settings > Data inputs > Files & directories
Click add new.
Follow the steps, making sure you set sourcetype=csv, and index=twilio.
You can choose wether to monitor a file or a directory. Protip: If you placed both files in the same directory during step one, it is quicker to provide Splunk with the directory to monitor. This way, if new Twilio logs are added in the future, Splunk will automatically ingest them.
3) Profit
If everything has worked well, a simple search for ""index=twilio"" should return some results. You might need to restart Splunk first.
Splunk SMS Alert Setup
0) Overview
1) Get your Twilio account keys
Get your Twilio Account SID and Auth Token on your Twilio Dashboard
2) Edit alert scripts
Go to ""$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/twilio-app/bin""
Using your favourite text editor open ""$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/twilio-app/bin/textalert-twilio.py""
Enter your Twilio Account SID (starting with AC) / Auth token
Enter ""TO phone number"" (recipient of SMS Text Message)
*Enter ""FROM phone number"" (sender of message, must be one of your Twilio Account phone #)
3) Configure an alert
Configure a Splunk alert and select the ""Run a Script"" option.
Set ""textalert-twilio.py"" as the script
Note: Twilio will charge you for every SMS message sent. You can view Twilio pricing @ https://www.twilio.com/sms/pricing
4) Profit
If everything has worked well the ""TO phone number"" should be recieving alerts. If not, check the alerts are being fired in the alert manager in the Splunk GUI via: ""Activity"" > ""Alert Manager""
Upcoming features
*Automated (real-time) collection of logs into Splunk via Twilio API.

This addon will collect audit events from the Okta Advanced Server Access (ASA) API and index them into Splunk. This makes tracking events like permission changes, server logins, credential approvals through ASA simple.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
This add-on will require an API key and secret to access the audit data from ASA.  We recommend creating a dedicated service account for this purpose and assigning the minimum privleges.  Perform the following steps in the ASA webapp.

Create a new service user in the ASA webapp
Create an API key for this new service user
Take note of the API Key ID and API Key Secret
Add your service user to a group, and be sure this group has at least the Reporting permission

Install
We can now install the Add-on in our Splunk environment.  This add-on is primarily a tool for collecting logs and is only required to be installed a heavy forwarder.  It does contain saved searches and other knowledge objects so installation on search heads is helpful.  Only configure an input on one Splunk server.

Install via the Splunk webapp (recommended) or manually copy and expand the app into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ location
Restart the Splunk server

Configure Settings (optional)

But many organizations are still flying blind, with no easy way to derive operational intelligence from the vast amounts of machine data generated by these critical systems.
It’s time for data streams from the mainframe to be as accessible as your other data streams when it comes to analytics for business intelligence and security monitoring.
Ironstream enables you to collect and forward mainframe log data, including security data, into Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security and Splunk IT Service Intelligence where you can get that true 360-degree view.
Users can then easily search, analyze, and visualize the data for powerful business intelligence reporting -- without needing specialized expertise and different monitoring systems for mainframe.

This App visualizes DNS traffic and helps to pinpoint errors and anomalies like DNS-Tunneling
This App takes an output of tcpdump as input, parses it and displays results as the following charts and tables:
Total Events
Parsing Errors
Query Type Distribution
Return Code Distribution
Protocol (UDP/TCP) Distribution
Top Queries
Top Level Domains
Top Reverse Resolution Entries (PTR)
Top DNS Errors
Slowest Transactions
Top Destinations
Top Sources
Packet count vs number of query names
DNS Packet Length
Number of Labels in the dns_qry_name
Query duration
Possible DNS Tunnelling
The DNS Traffic can be collected simultaneously from many different devices:
-windows (using TA-tshark or by capturing with Wireshark/tshark/dumpcap, and parsing with tcpdump on linux)
-linux (using TA-tcpdump or TA-tshark)
-switch mirror port (SPAN)
-TAP device
-manual import from a saved network dump (pcap file)
-Splunk Stream (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1809/)
-Technology Add-On for Unbound DNS (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4888/)
-Splunk Add-on for ISC BIND (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2876/) - query log only
INSTALLATION
For a single deployment (to collect DNS traffic from one system only) you need to install Splunk Enterprise + DNS_Insight App + TA-tcpdump (Linux) or TA-tshark (Windows).
For a distributed deploymeint (to collect DNS traffic from many systems):
Windows: Splunk Universal Forwarder + TA-tshark
Linux: Splunk Universal Forwarder + TA-tcpdump
Indexer: Splunk Enterprise + DNS_Insight App + TA-tshark + TA-tcpdump
Search Head: Splunk Enterprise + DNS_Insight App + TA-tshark + TA-tcpdump
Here is an example of a complete setup using a CentOS 7 or Debian 10 as a source of a DNS data input:
ATTENTION: running tcpdump as suggested can be a security risk and an example is provided for informational purposes only! Consult a security expert to minimize risk if unsure!
Option 1 - using TA-tcpdump (prefered, more secure and real time):
Download and install a preconfigured TA-tcpdump Addon from https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4818/
Option 2 - parsing after pcap rotation
Check if there is enough free space on the hard drive. You can consider using a separate partition for the tcpdump data.
aa-complain /usr/sbin/tcpdump # set tcpdump to complain mode - debian only
  useradd -d /nonexistent -s /usr/sbin/nologin tcpdup # add a restricted tcpdump user
  mkdir var/tcpdump # create a folder where pcap files and a script are stored
  chown :tcpdump /var/tcpdump # change ownership of the directory
  chmod g+w,o-w /var/tcpdump # change permissions of the directory
create /var/tcpdump/pcap2txt.sh file with this content:
#!/bin/bash
  set -euo pipefail
  IFS=$'\n\t'
  INFILE=$1
  OUTFILE=/var/tcpdump/tcpdump.txt
  LOG=/var/tcpdump/out.log
  date >> $LOG
  /usr/sbin/tcpdump -tttt -nns0 port 53 -r $INFILE > $OUTFILE 2>> $LOG
  wc $OUTFILE >> $LOG
add an executable bit:
chmod +x /var/tcpdump/pcap2txt.sh
This script will create a text dump from the recorded data after the rotation which can be sent to the splunk indexer using rsyslog/syslog-ng or splunk-forwarder. This input should be configured as a ""port53tttt"" sourcetype on the splunk indexer.
now start tcpdump (change the interface name as needed):
nohup tcpdump -pnns0 port 53 [-i ens32] -w /var/tcpdump/tcpdump.pcap -W100 -C100 -z /var/tcpdump/pcap2txt.sh -Z tcpdump &>>/var/tcpdump/out.log &
where:
-pnns0 - no promiscuous mode, don't convert protocol and port numbers etc. to names
  -C100 -W100 - create a ring buffer of 100 files a 100MB (10GB in total)
  -w - where to store recorded data
  -z /var/tcpdump/pcap2txt.sh - run a simple script after rotation
  -Z tcpdump - run as restricted ""tcpdump"" user
This app tested with CentOS 6/7, Debian 9/10 and Splunk 6/7/8.

Who is this app for?
This app is for dashboard designers who want to compactly display parent-child relationships in their data.
How does the app work?
This app provides a visualization that you can use in your own apps and dashboards.
To use it in your dashboards, simply install the app, and create a search that provides the values you want to display.
Usecases for the Tree View Visualization:
 Grouping categories together, e.g. sourcetypes by host
 Providing a compact interface for generating tokens for drill-downs in a dashboard
 Creating a menu in a set of dashboards
 Visualizing the layout of files, running process, or perfmon stats on multiple hosts
The following fields can be used in the search:
 id (required): An identifier for the lable. Use this value when assigning child items. Will default to the label if not supplied.
 label (required): The value shown next to the item.
 parentid (optional): Sets the parent item based on id. Will create a parent folder with the same label as the ID if one doesn't already exist.
 iconFolder (optional): When using ""custom"" style, selects icon for folders.
* iconDoc (optional): When using ""custom"" style, selects icon for child items.

Tokens are generated each time you click an item. This can be useful if you want to populate another panel on the dashboard with a custom search, or link to a new dashboard with the tokens carying across.

Label text : This is the display name of the selected item. Default value: $tv_label_token$
ID : This is the value of the selected group you clicked. Default value: $tv_id_token$
Parent ID : This is the value of the selected group you clicked. Default value: $tv_parent_id_token$

The following standard Splunk drill-down tokens are also generated:

row.label : The Label text
row.id : The ID
row.parentid : The parent ID
row.<fieldname> : the field ""fieldname"" from the search results.

This splunk add-on helps you to add/override a website category into central tenants from splunk using Sophos Central API. 
Add-on supports an adaptive response action item in Splunk Enterprise Security that you can configure in your corelation search or you can run it as an ad-hoc on any notable that gets triggered in Splunk. It works in the similar way as if you add a website in sophos central. 
This add-on is really helpful if you have policies defined in your central tenant based on website category. e.g Adding a policy to block websites that are categorized as Hacking, which will block all the websites that are categorzied as Hacking in your Central tenant.

Configuration
For cofiguration of this add-on, you will need API credentials : Client ID and Client Secret from Sophos Central. Please refer below link on how to generate API credentials for your central account:
https://developer.sophos.com/getting-started-tenant

Sophos Central API has three different type of accounts : Partners, organizations and tenants.  

Partners :  A partner is a business entity, typically a Distributor, a Value Added Reseller (VAR) or a Managed Service Provider (MSP) that operates within the Sophos sales channel. A partner manages multiple ""tenants"" and may sell Sophos software and services to multiple ""organizations"".
API Documentation : https://developer.sophos.com/getting-started


Organizations : An organization is a business entity that uses Sophos software and services. An organization has one or more tenants within Sophos Central.
API Documentation : https://developer.sophos.com/getting-started-organization


Tenant : A tenant is a collection of ""resources"" owned by an organization. An organization usually creates tenants for data isolation. They can also create tenants for ease of management. People that work for the organization, the devices they own, the security policies configured by an admin, and the security events generated, are all examples of resources that belong to the tenant.
API Documentation https://developer.sophos.com/getting-started-tenant



TL:DR : In case of Partner or Organization you might will have more that one Tenant. This Add-on will identify the type of account using Whoami API and will override the category in single or multiple tenanats as per account type.",Version 1.0.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/97a518a0-e46f-11eb-8da1-06382f3616cf.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://github.com/sophos-cybersecurity/Sophos-Central-add-on-for-Splunk/blob/master/LICENSE,82,0,splunk,4,1,Amit Panjawani,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/amitpanjawani,"Products: Splunk Enterprise

Florian Roth, June 2016
This App provides advanced analysis of THOR APT Scanner Events
The THOR App is the visual counterpart to the THOR Add-on. It provides general dashboards, special filtered views and a lot of reports to analyze and visualize the THOR log data. 
In order to use the indexed data, you have to install the THOR Add-on.
Dependencies
It requires the Add-on that are also available in Splunkbase. 
THOR Add-on
https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2711/
Log Input
You could use the input provided by the Add-on, which is on port 514/udp by default. Syslog input on any port is supported. You can also index the THOR text log files written by THOR during the scan. 
Always choose ""thor"" as index and ""thor"" as sourcetype to make the results visible in the App.
Event Type
All searches and dashboards work with the ""thor_events"" event type. Adjust the event type to select a different data set for the App. 
For example: 
If you have collected THOR reports from a certain unit and want to inlcude only these reports in the App, you could edit the event type via ""Settings > Event Types"" and change the event type to somthing like
source=/var/log/thor_logs_from_unit_x/*
False Positives
Define false positives via ""Settings > Tags"" and edit the ""false_positives"" tag to add more false positive expressions. Be advised that changes to the tags can take up to 10 minutes to be visible in searches.
Encryption
Adjust the password to decrypt XOR encrypted messages via ""Settings > Advanced Search > Search Macros"" and edit the ""decrypt_thor_events"" search macro. 
Use the ""--xor"" parameter and optionally the ""-k"" parameter in THOR scans to enable encrypted SYSLOG message and set a custom key.",Version 1.3.3,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/cbe67dd8-5c98-11e7-9237-02f13bdc2585.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance",http://www.opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0,"2,165",0,splunk,5,7,Florian Roth,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/FRoth,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

Inputs for the Fire Brigade app

This technology add-on for the Fire Brigade app is a data collection tool
only. It contains a saved search, called ""DB inspection"", which is scheduled
to run once daily, and a couple of macros to support this search.
The search calls the ""dbinspect"" search command, once for each index listed
within the ""monitored_indexes.csv"" lookup table. Only indexes named in this
table will be examined in this way. It is important to keep this list up to
date if comprehensive monitoring of the indexes in your environment is
required.
The dbinspect command provides a listing of all of the buckets within the
named index, and some statistics about each. This data is required by the main
Fire Brigade application to display relevant charts and metrics about the
monitored indexes. Now with version 6.0, dbinspect is a ""distributed"" search
command, meaning that it will show the status of all buckets across all
indexers when run in a distributed environment. This makes it possible to
install only one copy of the TA, on the search head, which will collect from
all of the peers. However, the ""traditional"" method of installing the TA on
each indexing node, is still available as well.
NOTE: Due to a change in the way this application is packaged, a standalone
Splunk system (all-in-one) now needs this TA; the main Fire Brigade app
itself does not collect the required data from the standalone system.
Data collected by this app is sent to the ""summary"" index, which exists in all
default Splunk installations. No additional indexes need to be created.
Configuration
There are two modes of operation for this TA. The data collection script will
run the dbinspect search command, looping over all of the indexes listed in
the lookup table ""monitored_indexes.csv"". Administrators have the option of
manually updating this list to constrain the search to only a subset of
indexes. In order to achieve this manual control, the saved search titled
""Update monitored list from REST"" must be disabled. The default behavior is
for this search to periodically use the REST API to retrieve the current list
of non-disabled indexes on the local system, and saves the results to the
monitored_indexes.csv. In this default mode, the TA will track all of the
indexes on the system automatically, without the need to manually update the
lookup table.
Compatibility
The output from the dbinspect command changed in version 6.0. This app is
specifically tuned for version 6.0 and higher. If you're running Splunk 4.3 or
Splunk 5.x, use TA-fire_brigade version 1.",Version 2.0.1,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/673bbd2e-6900-11e3-b4de-005056ad5c72.png,Utilities,https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-software-license-agreement.html,"2,051",0,splunk,5,3,Sanford Owings,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/sowings_splunk,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2628,2022-01-10,08:29:26 AM,MuRo,,"Feb. 2, 2015","MuRo - Multiple Regex at Once!
The MuRo custom search command is a 'naive' implementation that allows one to search for multiple regexps through one single Splunk search.
The regexeps are dynamically loaded when MuRo is executed. This means you don't have to restart Splunk when you add a new list of regexeps or modify an existing one.
MuRo does not provides you with regexps, it provides you a way of evaluating regexp.
Options
| muro file=""<FILE>"" [ignorecase=True|False] [merge=True|False] <FIELDS>

file
This is the file containing the regex to load (one per line). 
This file must be located in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/muro/local/.


ignorecase
This boolean flag controls the case sensitivity of the regex. 
This trigger the re.IGNORECASE flag from the python re library.
default: False


merge
This boolean flag will modify the behavior of the muro command. 
If not set, all regex are executed one after each other against each of the specified fields.
If set, the regex are aggregated into one single regex with the OR operator |. Activating
this option will remove the ability to know which regex matched. Please note that this is 
not an optimization of the regex tree.
default: False



Examples
| muro file=list1.txt merge=True url domain _raw
| muro file=list-ua.txt http_user_agent
| muro file=list-ua.txt ignorecase=True http_user_agent
Results
The custom search command muro will create a new field named muro which will contain the results of your regex search.
You will have results similar to the following one:
_raw:1,_raw:2
url:10
The presentation of the results is field_name:regex_number where field_name is the name of the field you specified during the search and regex_number is the line number of the regex that matched in the file you specified.
In the previous example, the results have to be read like this:

The field _raw matched against the regex line 1 and the regex line 2.
Thie field url matched against the regex line 10.

NOTE:

When multiple fields are displayed in one line, this means that multiple regexps matched the very same log line.
You cannot have those results if you chose to activate the merge option during your search (-1 will be returned).

Performances
Evaluating the performances of MuRo is difficult because it's closely related to the regex you are using (number of regexeps, complexity of the regexeps). Moreover, other factors are involved like the log type you are processing, the hardware you are using, the current load of your systems, etc
As an indicator, two searches were run with a regex file of 155 regex against 10,000 events from the _internal index. Note that purposely none of the regex would match the submitted test events in order to force MuRo to go through all regexeps.
Here are the raw results:

MuRo search with merge=False: 4.058 seconds (3.58 seconds in command.muro)
MuRo search with merge=True: 3.237 seconds (2.76 seconds in command.muro)

Add-on Homepage: https://apps.splunk.com/apps/id/TA-sophos_central_github
Author: Hurricane Labs
Version: 1.0.3
Description
You are required to download the Sophos Central script from their GitHub here for this add-on to work: https://github.com/sophos/Sophos-Central-SIEM-Integration
Note: We do not own the rights nor are we a maintainer of this GitHub page. This script runs outside of Splunk, and is NOT included in this add-on. This is the only script that Sophos will provide support for if you have issues. Other add-ons or scripts are not guaranteed to deliver all of your data!
The purpose of this add-on is to provide value to your Sophos Central Event Reports logs, using the official script supported by Sophos. This is done by making the logs CIM compliant, adding tagging for Enterprise Security data models, and other knowledge objects to make searching and visualizing this data easy.

Built for Splunk Enterprise 6.x.x or higher
CIM Compliant (CIM 4.0.0 or higher)
Ready for Enterprise Security
Built based on the official Sophos Central SIEM integration script (v1.1.0)
https://community.sophos.com/kb/en-us/125169
https://github.com/sophos/Sophos-Central-SIEM-Integration
Supports all three output formats (CEF, JSON, and Keyvalue)
Supports file and syslog output methods





Constraints

This add-on requires that you initially bring on the data with the correct sourcetype built for your output format (CEF, JSON, or Keyvalue). Respectively those are ""sophos:central:cef"", ""sophos:central:keyvalue"", and ""sophos:central:json"". These sourcetypes will then be transformed into either ""sophos:central:events"" or ""sophos:central:alerts"" depending on the endpoint it comes from (Event or Alert endpoint).
The script itself will run outside of Splunk, it is not controlled by this add-on in any way. I will provide basic instructions for how to go through the entire setup, but my steps may not work with your environment/OS. You should not need to modify this add-on in any way to get it to work.
This was built around v1.1.0 of the release on GitHub. It is possible that the fields or format will change in updates to the GitHub project. Please keep this in mind when using our add-on.

INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

Search Head: Add-on Always Required (Knowledge Objects)
Heavy Forwarder: Add-on Possibly Required (Data Collection and/or Event Parsing)
Indexer: Possibly Add-on Required (Data Collection and/or Event Parsing)
Universal Forwarder: Add-on Never Required (Data Collection only)
SH & Indexer Clustering: Supported

This add-on needs to be installed on your Search Head(s) and on the FIRST Splunk Enterprise system(s) that handles the data, traditionally that would be a Heavy Forwarder or Indexer. This add-on should not be deployed to a Universal Forwarder as it won't do anything, even if it's doing the data collection.
Script Example Setup Instructions
Note: There are installation/configuration instructions here as well: https://github.com/sophos/Sophos-Central-SIEM-Integration
1. Untar the Github folder anywhere. In this example we will use '/opt/sophos-central' and install as root.
2. Configure the ""SOPHOS_SIEM_HOME"" environment variable to point at the script install path.
echo 'export SOPHOS_SIEM_HOME=/opt/sophos-central/Sophos-Central-SIEM-Integration' >> /etc/profile.d/20-sophos_home.sh
3. Configure the config.ini file in the install folder. The comments will explain what settings you can use. If you choose to write to ""file"", your logs will be stored in 'log' folder of your install folder.
nano /opt/sophos-central/Sophos-Central-SIEM-Integration/config.ini
4. Test the script (you may need to exit and re-enter your root shell to get the export env variable to work from step 2.)
/usr/bin/python /opt/sophos-central/Sophos-Central-SIEM-Integration/siem.py -d
5. Run the command 'env' and copy the output of PATH and SOPHOS_SIEM_HOME for the next step.
6. Configure a cron job to run the script every 5 minutes. Paste in your env variables from the last step.
nano /etc/cron.d/sophos-central
SOPHOS_SIEM_HOME=/opt/sophos-central/Sophos-Central-SIEM-Integration
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/opt/splunk/bin:/snap/bin
*/5 * * * * root /usr/bin/python /opt/sophos-central/Sophos-Central-SIEM-Integration/siem.py

Add-on Installation Instructions
NOTE: I highly recommend running the script and add-on on a Splunk HF using the file method and JSON output. This makes everything easy and straightforward for install.

Install this add-on on the first Splunk Enterprise instance the data touches. This is typically a Heavy Forwarder or Indexer.
Restart Splunk to ensure the add-on settings are in place before proceeding.


Install this add-on on your Search Heads where the knowledge objects are required.
A Splunk Restart may be required, you may also attempt a debug refresh.


Setup your inputs.conf. This will vary depending on the output method you chose (file or syslog)
File Method
You will need to get your inputs.conf on the system where you installed the Sophos script. You will want to set it up to either monitor or batch the ""log"" directory of the script install directory. I would recommend using a batch input instead of a file monitor, otherwise your file will grow exponentially.
It is incredibly important that you pick the correct sourcetype for your inputs.conf. Set the sourcetype to either ""sophos:central:cef"", ""sophos:central:keyvalue"", or ""sophos:central:json"" (no quotes!) Please see the ""Constraints"" section for more details.
See the ""Example Inputs.conf"" section for additional help.


Syslog Method
You will need to get your inputs.conf on the system where you are forwarding the syslog to. Try to have your syslog solution write these out as true to the raw log format as possible. I would highly recommend CEF if you are forwarding this over syslog.
It is incredibly important that you pick the correct sourcetype for your inputs.conf. Set the sourcetype to either ""sophos:central:cef"", ""sophos:central:keyvalue"", or ""sophos:central:json"" (no quotes!) Please see the ""Constraints"" section for more details.
See the ""Example Inputs.conf"" section for additional help.




Verify data is coming in and you are seeing the proper field extractions & sourcetype transforms by searching the data.
Example Search: index=* sourcetype=sophos:central:* | dedup sourcetype
Note: If you see ""sophos:central:cef"", ""sophos:central:keyvalue"", or ""sophos:central:json"" in your search, you did not install the add-on on the first Splunk Enterprise system that touches the data (or didn't restart Splunk). The add-on will not work properly until that is corrected.



Example Inputs.conf
How you choose to bring the data into Splunk is completely up to you. Here are a couple examples of how you might setup inputs.conf:
File Method using CEF output
[batch:///opt/sophos-central/Sophos-Central-SIEM-Integration/log/]
disabled = 0
sourcetype = sophos:central:cef
index = sophos
move_policy = sinkhole
crcSalt = <SOURCE>

File Method using Keyvalue output
[batch:///opt/sophos-central/Sophos-Central-SIEM-Integration/log/]
disabled = 0
sourcetype = sophos:central:keyvalue
index = sophos
move_policy = sinkhole
crcSalt = <SOURCE>

File Method using JSON output
[batch:///opt/sophos-central/Sophos-Central-SIEM-Integration/log/]
disabled = 0
sourcetype = sophos:central:json
index = sophos
move_policy = sinkhole
crcSalt = <SOURCE>

Syslog Method using CEF output
[monitor:///var/log/network/sophos_central/\*/\*.syslog]
disabled = 0
sourcetype = sophos:central:cef
index = sophos

New features
Known Issues

If your script is outputting in json format but has newlines in the log, you will need to override the default/props.conf that comes with the app. This would go on the first Splunk Enterprise instance that touches the data.

[sophos:central:json]
LINE_BREAKER = ([\r\n]+){\n*\s*""source_info""
Fixed issues


1.0.3:

Fixed value of 'signature' when it contained a space in CEF format.
Fixed missing file_path and file fields in certain events that miss the standard field header.



1.0.2:

Fixed sourcetype transform, now based on datastream field.
Fixed duplicate value for ""type"" field by renaming the extraction to ""vendor_type"".
Fixed improper dest extraction on CEF events.
Fixed bad extract on file.
Fixed json/kv user extraction when computer name is absent from suser.



1.0.1:

Fixed improper event type tagging for Enterprise Security. Only cleaned events were being tagged as malware.

Visit the “Asana for Splunk” application on Splunkbase to begin the installation process. Depending on your Splunk configuration, you may need to install the app via the apps menu in the topbar and then via ""Find more Apps"" or ""Browse More Apps.""
If you're on a Splunk Cloud Classic experience, navigate to your IDM. If you're on a Splunk Cloud Victoria experience, navigate to your Search Head.
In Asana’s Admin Console, create a Service Account and copy the Domain ID from the settings tab. Enter these values on the Configuration page. 

Navigate to the input step and enter an ingestion interval (in seconds format) between 30 seconds and 300 seconds (or five minutes).
On the same page, enter a backfill range in “number of days”. Note: if you leave this blank, it will default your installation to 30 days of backfill. Asana stores logs for a maximum of 90 days after capture.
Finally, set up your index macro on your Search Head. This is accessed by navigating to Settings > Advanced Search > Search Macros. From there, you’ll click on “asana-index” and edit the description of the macro to be “index=<your index name>” and click “save”. Your Asana for Splunk dashboard and appendix will begin to populate after you complete this step.
Depending on the period of backfill you have selected, full data ingestion may take several hours to appear.

But many organizations are still flying blind, with no easy way to derive operational intelligence from the vast amounts of machine data generated by these critical systems.
It’s time for data streams from the mainframe to be as accessible as your other data streams when it comes to analytics for business intelligence and security monitoring.
Ironstream enables you to collect and forward mainframe log data, including security data, into Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security and Splunk IT Service Intelligence where you can get that true 360-degree view.
Users can then easily search, analyze, and visualize the data for powerful business intelligence reporting -- without needing specialized expertise and different monitoring systems for mainframe.
Make more sense of the valuable machine data hidden away on your mainframe.

Installation
There are two ways to install the dashboard - via the Splunk app listing, or manually with a provided dashboard 
package. To install the dashboard via the app listing, follow these steps:

From the Apps menu in Splunk, select Manage Apps
Select Browse More Apps
Do a search for the ""Rapid7 InsightVM Dashboard""
Select Install from the app listing
Perform a restart of Splunk when prompted

To install the add-on manually, follow these steps:

From the Apps menu in Splunk, select Manage Apps
Select Install app from file
Select the InsightVM Dashboard
Perform a restart of Splunk when prompted

The add-on should now appear as Rapid7 InsightVM Dashboard under the Apps menu in Splunk.
Configuration
This dashboard must be used alongside the Rapid7 InsightVM Technology Add-On. The add-on serves as the method for 
retrieving asset and vulnerability data, which is then visualized with this dashboard. There are three sourcetypes to 
keep in mind when searching or creating visualizations of this data:

rapid7:insightvm:asset
rapid7:insightvm:asset:vulnerability_finding
rapid7:insightvm:vulnerability_definition

InsightVM Asset Dashboard
There are a few different components in the Asset Dashboard that display or visualize the imported InsightVM asset 
data. It's important to ensure that the correct index is selected here, as otherwise you may not see any data. The 
default index for the Dashboard follows that of the Technology Add-On and will be set to rapid7, but you can update 
this if a different one was chosen for data import.
Additional filtering can be done with the Tags dropdown, which uses tags - aggregates of site, asset groups, and 
asset tags - retrieved from InsightVM, and the Time Period dropdown, which allows you to select a date range for 
your data.

Current Version: 2.2.0
Overview
The VMware Carbon Black EDR App for Splunk lets administrators leverage the industry's leading EDR solution to detect and take action on endpoint activity directly from within Splunk.
Dashboards
Builtin dashboards provide you with a quick health check on your Carbon Black EDR server, the status of your Carbon Black EDR deployment, and an overview of detected threats on your network. Eight example dashboards are distributed with this app; not all of these are populated with data, depending on what events are being forwarded to Splunk via the Carbon Black Event Forwarder.

Overview: Provides a quick overview, including the number of sensors reporting alerts and the top feed and watchlist hits across the enterprise.
Binary Search: Searches the Carbon Black EDR binary holdings via the binarysearch custom command.
Process Search: Searches the processes that are tracked by Carbon Black EDR via the processsearch custom command.
Process Timeline: Produces a simple timeline of events based on a Carbon Black EDR process GUID.
Sensor Search: Searches endpoints that are tracked by Carbon Black EDR via the sensorsearch custom command.
Carbon Black EDR Endpoint Status: Displays information about the total number of reported sensors, OS, and Carbon Black EDR agent version distribution across all endpoints.
Carbon Black EDR Network Overview: Visualizes incoming and outgoing network connections that are recorded by Carbon Black EDR. This view is only populated if netconn events are forwarded via the Carbon Black Event Forwarder.
Carbon Black EDR Binary Status: Displays information about attempts to execute banned processes, and new executables and shared libraries that are discovered by Carbon Black EDR.

Custom Commands
You can use custom commands in your Splunk pipeline to access Splunk's visualization and searching capability on Carbon Black EDR data, without ingesting all of the raw endpoint data into Splunk.

sensorsearch: Search for sensors by IP address or hostname.
processsearch: Search for processes in your Carbon Black EDR server.
binarysearch: Search for binaries in your Carbon Black EDR server.

Adaptive Response Alert Actions
The Carbon Black EDR Splunk app currently includes three Adaptive Response Alert Actions that allow you to take action directly from the Splunk console. The actions occur as either a result of automated correlation searches or on an ad-hoc basis through the Splunk Enterprise Security Incident Review page.

Kill Process: Kill a given process that is actively running on an endpoint that is running the Carbon Black EDR sensor. The process must be identified by a Carbon Black EDR event ID. Killing processes allow the security analyst to quickly respond to attackers who are using tools that cannot otherwise be banned by hash (for example, reusing a legitimate administrative tool for malicious purposes).
Ban MD5 Hash: Ban a given MD5 hash from executing on any host that is running the Carbon Black EDR sensor. The MD5 hash can be specified by a custom hash field. This feature allows incident responders to quickly react to evolving threats by keeping attackers’ tools from executing while the threat is properly remediated and the attacker is expelled from the network. 
Isolate Sensor: Isolate an endpoint from the network. The endpoint can be specified by a custom IP address field or a sensor ID that’s provided in Carbon Black EDR events in Splunk. Isolation is useful when malware is active on an endpoint. It lets you perform investigative tasks (for example, retrieving files or killing processes through Carbon Black Live Response) from your management console while preventing any connections to active command and control or exfiltration of sensitive data.

Saved Searches
Included in this release are 58 saved searches to jump-start Threat Hunting from within the Splunk environment. These are all disabled by default. Some dashboards will throw an error for ""Saved Search doesn't exist"" if the search is not enabled. Simply enabling the stated saved search will enable the dashboard to work correctly. 
The list below are the primary dashboard searches.
1. CbResponse Alert Activity
1. CbResponse New Binaries
Workflow Actions
This app includes workflow actions to provide additional context from Carbon Black EDR on events that originated from any product that pushes data to your Splunk server. These context menu items include the following:

Deep links: Deep links into the Carbon Black EDR server for any event that originated from a Carbon Black EDR sensor. This allows you to access the Process Tree and other Carbon Black EDR data from a single link inside Splunk.
Process search by IP, MD5: Search the Carbon Black EDR server for processes that are associated with a given IP address or MD5 hash from any event in Splunk.
Sensor info by IP: Search the Carbon Black EDR server for detailed endpoint information that is associated with a given IP address from any event in Splunk.

Requirements
This app requires a functional Carbon Black EDR server, version 5.1 or above, and Splunk version 6.4 or above. The app works with Carbon Black EDR clusters. The Carbon Black EDR Unified View (Federated) server is not currently supported.
Getting Started
After the Carbon Black EDR app for Splunk is installed, you must configure it to connect to your Carbon Black EDR server by using the Carbon Black EDR REST API. For more information on the Carbon Black EDR REST API and how to generate an API key, see the Carbon Black Developer Network.
The Carbon Black EDR app for Splunk uses a Carbon Black EDR API key to do the following:

Power the sensorsearch, processsearch, and binarysearch custom commands by performing searches via the Carbon Black EDR API.
Enable the Endpoint Isolation Adaptive Response Action by requesting endpoint isolation through the Carbon Black EDR API.
Enable the Ban Hash Adaptive Response Action by using the Carbon Black EDR API to add an MD5 hash to the list of banned hashes.
Enable the Kill Process Adaptive Response Action by using the Carbon Black EDR Live Response API to kill a process on a remote endpoint. Live Response must be enabled on the Carbon Black EDR server for this action to function; see the VMware Carbon Black EDR User Guide for more information about Live Response.

To configure the Carbon Black EDR app for Splunk to connect to your Carbon Black EDR server:

Click the Apps dropdown next to the Splunk icon at the top of the Splunk dashboard.
Click the Manage Apps menu item.
Click the Set Up action to the right of the Carbon Black EDR app.
Retrieve an API key for a Global Administrator user on the Carbon Black EDR server. See the authentication instructions at the Carbon Black Developer Network.
Return to the Splunk configuration page and do the following:
Paste the API token into the apikey field.
Enter the URL for your Carbon Black EDR server instance in the URL field. For example, enter: https://cbserver.mycompany.com.


Click Setup to save the new configuration.


Note: SSL validation is enabled by default. 
To disable SSL Validation, create $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/DA-ESS-CbResponse/local/DA-ESS-CbResponse_Settings.conf with the following content:
[ssl_info]
ssl_verify=false

The Carbon Black EDR app for Splunk uses Splunk’s encrypted credential storage facility to securely store the API token for your Carbon Black EDR server.
To change the API key or Carbon Black EDR server URL after the Splunk app has been set up, visit the setup page at  https://<SPLUNK_SERVER>/en-US/app/DA-ESS-CbResponse/setup_page.
Using the VMware Carbon Black EDR App for Splunk
After the app is installed, a new icon showing the VMware Carbon Black EDR logo appears on the left-hand side of the Splunk front page. Clicking the logo brings you to the default dashboard of the Carbon Black EDR for the Splunk app. Additional dashboards include an overview of endpoint status, including a breakdown of OS and sensor versions, as well as data on the latest new binaries seen in the environment. 
The Process, Binary, and Sensor Search dashboards allow you to perform Carbon Black searches directly from within Splunk. These dashboards use the respective custom commands to perform the search through the REST API without ingesting the data into Splunk. The results are displayed on the same screen. You can also use Carbon Black search features using custom search commands.
Examples:
- processsearch query=""process_name:cmd.exe""
- binarysearch query=""md5:fd3cee0bbc4e55838e65911ff19ef6f5""
- sensorsearch query=”ip:172.22.5.141” 
Using Custom Commands
The Splunk app includes three custom commands to perform searches on the Carbon Black datastore from Splunk: binarysearch, processsearch, and sensorsearch. These three commands have corresponding views in the Carbon Black app: Binary Search, Process Search, and Sensor Search.
To use the custom commands in your Splunk searches, first make sure that you’re using the Carbon Black EDR context by invoking the search through the Splunk > Search menu in the Carbon Black EDR app. You can use any of the search commands by appending the Carbon Black EDR query as a “query” parameter. For example:
| sensorsearch query=”ip:172.22.5.141”

sends an API request to Carbon Black EDR to query for all sensors that have reported an IP address of 172.22.5.141. The result of this query can be piped through to other Splunk commands for aggregation, visualization, and correlation.
To update the base EDR index for macros and eventtypes, change [edr_base_index] in eventtypes.conf.
Using Saved Searches
Several example reports and saved searches are included in this app release. You can find a full list of these searches in Settings > Searches, Reports, and Alerts menu item from the Carbon Black EDR app. None of these are run or scheduled to run by default, and some will not return any data unless certain data types (netconns, procstarts, etc.) are forwarded via the Carbon Black Event Forwarder into Splunk.
Using Adaptive Response Alert Actions
The Carbon Black EDR app for Splunk now integrates with Splunk’s Adaptive Response framework and provides three Adaptive Response Alert Actions:

Isolate Endpoint
Ban MD5 Hash
Kill Process

Each of these Actions can be performed either on an ad-hoc basis on a notable event surfaced in Enterprise Security, or on an automated basis as part of a Splunk Correlation Search. In addition, the Isolate Endpoint and Ban MD5 Hash actions can be invoked based on search results from any Splunk search, as long as a field is present that provides an IP address (for Isolate Endpoint) or an MD5 hash (for Ban Hash). Currently, only events that are surfaced via the Carbon Black Event Forwarder can be used as input for the Kill Process alert action.
Using Workflow Actions
Workflow Actions allow you to pivot into Carbon Black searches from standardized fields.
The Carbon Black EDR app for Splunk includes Workflow Actions with context about events in any Splunk view, including Enterprise Security’s Notable Event table. 
To Perform a workflow action, drilldown into an event and click the Event Actions button.
The available workflow actions from this app are displayed. You can pivot directly from a field if a workflow action is available for that field.
The following Workflow Actions are included:

Sensor Information by IP: find detailed information about a Carbon Black EDR sensor given an IP address field.
Binary Search by MD5 hash: retrieve context around a binary that has a specific MD5 file hash.
Search for Processes contacting IP: retrieve a list of processes from Carbon Black EDR that have made a connection to or received a connection from the given IP address.
Search for Processes related to MD5 hash: retrieve a list of processes from Carbon Black EDR that have links to the given MD5 hash (a loaded module/DLL, the executable itself, a file write to an executable with the given MD5 hash).
Search for Processes contacting Domain: retrieve a list of processes from Carbon Black EDR that have made a connection to or received a connection from the given domain name.
Search for Processes related to filename: retrieve a list of processes from Carbon Black EDR that refer to the given filename (written/modified the file, etc.).

In addition, for events that were generated by Carbon Black EDR (forwarded into Splunk via the Carbon Black Event Forwarder), additional Workflow Actions provide deep links into the Carbon Black EDR console directly from the event in Splunk, where applicable. These deep links require the Carbon Black Event Forwarder to be configured to generate these links at event generation time (see the Carbon Black Event Forwarder configuration file for more details).

Deep Link to target process's Process Analysis page
Deep Link to parent process's Process Analysis page
Deep Link to child process's Process Analysis page
Deep Link to Binary Analysis page
Deep Link to Sensor page

Using Performance & Data Models
This app contains one data model, which represents Carbon Black alerts plus watchlist/feed hits. The data model CbR_Alert is generated by searching for Carbon Black EDR 
events with the query tag=alert. This data model is accelerated by default.
In addition, the saved search CbResponse Alert Activity is scheduled to run once per day by default, but is disabled out-of-box.
Diagnostics
The Carbon Black EDR App for Splunk writes its log files into the standard Splunk log directory. The following log files (at $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk) are used by the App:

da-ess-cbresponse.log: main log file for common Carbon Black EDR helper functions, including the search Custom Commands
isolate_modalert.log: log file for the Isolate Endpoint Adaptive Response Action
banhash_modalert.log: log file for the Ban Hash Adaptive Response Action
killprocess_modalert.log: log file for the Kill Process Adaptive Response Action

It contains aggregated counters of sessions, line charts showing trends, maximum score values over time, as well as a table showing sessions in the selected time period. It builds on data that is constantly being updated, in near real-time.
• The detailed session analytics dashboard shows detailed information about a single selected session only, including not only general information about the session, but the aggregated risk score and individual algorithm scores as well.

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4203,2022-01-10,08:30:47 AM,ZFS Add-On for Splunk,,"Oct. 21, 2021","ZFS Add-On for Splunk
For OpenZFS 0.8.x
ZFS storage pools maintain themselves very isolated from the host OS, making generic unix commands such as df, du, iostat, and others questionable at best. Further, the provided zfs utilities are oriented
 towards human readable output rather than machine parsable output.
This Add-On is intended to address both of these monitoring issues with minimal dependancies. Built using zfsutils, Splunk Modular Inputs, and Python.
Prerequisites
The pre-requisites for the add-on are as follows;

Indexers: None
Search Heads: None
Heavy Forwarders (gateway): None
Heavy Forwarders (endpoint): zfsutils
Universal Forwarders (endpoint): python2, zfsutils

Installing & Deploying the Add-On
Installation instructions are as follows;
1) Carefully review README.txt, README/inputs.conf.spec, and default/inputs.conf.
2) Create your own indexes to send data from this Add-On into. This Add-On does not create or ship any by default.
3) Create a local/inputs.conf with the inputs you desire togged on (disabled = false)
4) Add a zpool_list (space delimited) or a filter entry to each input as necessary. Review README/inputs.conf.spec for more information.
5) Follow the steps below for deployment

Splunk Indexers:
Add-on should be installed on Indexers to properly set the timestamp rules. Deploy using master-apps (clustered) or directly in apps (unclustered).


Splunk Search Heads:
Add-on should be installed on Search Heads to properly enable JSON parsing.


Splunk Heavy Forwarders (gateway):
Add-on should be installed on Heavy Forwarders to properly set the timestamp rules. Deploy directly in apps.


Splunk Heavy Forwarders (endpoint):
Add-on should be installed on Heavy forwarders and inputs.conf modified to README/inputs.conf.spec and default/inputs.conf specifications. Deploy directly in apps.


Splunk Universal Forwarders (endpoint):
Add-on should be installed on Universal forwarders and inputs.conf modified to README/inputs.conf.spec and default/inputs.conf specifications. Deploy directly in apps.



Upgrading from Version 1
This latest iteration of the ZFS Add-On for Splunk involves some breaking changes to zfs_status. 
In the past, zfs_status was specifically targetted at ""post scrub"" output from ""zpool status"".
This new version is generic, and is intended to cover all outputs from ""zpool status"", so the field language that was specific to the scrub operation is gone.
To migrate, you will have to either rewrite old search-artifacts that targetted these fields, or deploy Version 1 zfs_status and Version 2 side by side.
I encourage you to ""rip off the bandaid"" in this case. The new version is vastly superior for operational visibility.
Testing & Troubleshooting
There are several moving parts to this add-on. If you run into issues check the following;
splunkd.log in search or at $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log
splunk cmd splunkd print-modinput-config myscheme mystanza
splunk cmd splunkd print-modinput-config --debug myscheme mystanza
splunk cmd splunkd print-modinput-config myscheme mystanza | python /path/to/script/in/question.py

The main app dashboard can take some time before the data is returned which will populate some of the panels. A good test to see that you are receiving all of the data we expect is to run this search after several minutes:
search `fidelis_get_xps_event` | stats count by sourcetype

In particular, you should see these sourcetypes:
 fidelis:xps
 fidelis:xps:api
If you don't see these sourcetypes, have a look at the log file $SPLUNK_HOME$/var/log/TA_fidelis/fidelis.log.",Version 1.0.4,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/ac2e8300-7679-11e7-865b-02f13bdc2585.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,404,0,splunk,5,1,Fidelis CyberSecurity,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/Fidelis_CyberSecurity,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud

Pulse Connect Secure Add-on for Splunk provides CIM compliant field extractions and data enrichment for your Pulse Connect Secure data.
Version 1.1.2
Release Notes
1.1.2: June 2019
-Corrected timestamp extraction
-Added Field extraction for the fields header and priority, sent since the Pulse secure version 8.3R4
1.1.1: January 2019
- Adjusted sourcetype overriding logic by leaving line merging and timestamp extracting parameters in the initial sourcetype only
- Removed and unused transforms.conf entry
1.1: January 2018
- Fixed a sample file
1.0: January 2018
    - Initial release
Install Pulse Connect Secure Add-on for Splunk:
Deploy Pulse Connect Secure Add-on for Splunk on your Splunk platform. For distributed environments, Pulse Connect Secure Add-on for Splunk needs to be deployed on the Search Head as well as on Indexer(s) or Heavy Forwarder(s) because it includes transform actions at index-time.
Collect syslog events from a Pulse Connect Secure appliance
In order to forward Pulse Connect Secure syslog data to a Splunk Indexer, Heavy Forwarder or syslog server using Splunk format, please refer the following knowledge base article https://docs.pulsesecure.net/WebHelp/Content/PCS/PCS_AdminGuide_8.2/Configuring%20Syslog.htm
Among various log format, the Standard (default) format should be chosen.
As data is transmitted via UDP only, it is recommended to send it to a syslog server such as rsyslog or syslog-ng, and then to forward it to a Splunk Indexer over TLS.
Index Pulse Connect Secure syslog data:
Never mind the chosen path, Pulse Connect Secure syslog data should be indexed under the sourcetype ""pulse:connectsecure"". Configure your Splunk receiving instance to accept Pulse Connect Secure / syslog server input.
A sample configuration is provided in Pulse Connect Secure Add-on for Splunk default directory:
[Recommended] When Pulse Connect Secure syslog data is forwarded from a syslog server over TLS:
[tcp-ssl:port]
sourcetype = pulse:connectsecure

[Not recommended] When syslog data is directly forwarded from the Pulse Connect Secure appliance or VM:
[udp://Pulse Connect Secure IP:514]
sourcetype = pulse:connectsecure

It can be used on your Splunk Indexer of Heavy Forwarder.
If needed, please refer to ""Get data from TCP and UDP ports"" on Splunk Docs.
Log Samples:
Do not hesitate to check provided log samples to make sure your indexed data matches data used to build this Add-on.
Sourcetypes:
Besides indexing events under dedicated sourcetype pulse:connectsecure, Pulse Connect Secure Add-on for Splunk will index Web requests under the sourcetype pulse:connectsecure:web.

GETTING STARTED:
-Install CS:GO Server (https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Dedicated_Servers#Downloading_the_CS:GO_Dedicated_Server )
-Create your server.cfg 
-Create autoexec.cfg
--""log on""
-Install Splunk
-Install this app
-Modify $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/csgo/default/inputs.conf and point the input to your log file
I built this app after experiencing Jesse Miller's TF2 App at Splunk's .conf2013 and took a slightly different direction in creating how Splunk interprets CS:GO log files. I made a few modifications to the dashboards to create charts that better represent Counter-Strike over Team Fortress 2 as well as made a change to the Play-By-Play dashboard to better distinguish between a regular frag, a headshot and a knife kill. 
There are two dashboards:
-The default CS:GO Dashboard that contains a time picker that sets the 
range over which the embedded reports will provide results for.
-The Play-by-Play Dashboard contains a realtime search that formats
player-kill (AKA ""frag"") events into a table, presenting the frag
count of both the player and his/her team.
I hope you enjoy this app and please feel free to send comments directly to me:

Flashpoint App for Splunk allows you to leverage the Flashpoint platform's Indicators, Reports and CVEs(including Exploits and Mentions) within your Splunk instance.
Requirements
Splunk Enterprise:

Version 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 and 8.0.0

Flashpoint Add-on for Splunk

Version 1.1.2

Python version

Version 2.7 and 3.7

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04, CentOS 7.5.18 and Windows Server 2016
Recommended System Configuration

Standard Splunk configuration of Search Head, Indexer, and Forwarder.
The Flashpoint Add-on for Splunk should be installed on the heavy forwarder and Search Head and the Flashpoint App for Splunk should be installed on the Search Head.

Installation
This App can be installed through UI using the following steps.

Log in to Splunk Web and navigate to Apps > Manage Apps.
Click the install app from file.
Click Choose File and select the flashpoint App installation file.
Click on Upload.

Install from the command line using the following command:
sh $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk install app $PATH_TO_SPL/flashpoint-1.1.1.spl/
Upgrading to version 1.1.1
Follow the below steps to upgrade the App to 1.1.1

Log in to Splunk Web and navigate to Apps > Manage Apps.
Click the install app from file.
Click the Choose File button and select the flashpoint App installation file and checked the Upgrade app checkbox.
Click on Upload.

Once the installation is complete, restart Splunk. Now go to the matching configuration page to set up the indexes and the time-range from which the matching of the IOCs should execute. Note that if this set up is not done, then the app will start the matching of event from the last 1 hour by default.
Matching Configuration Page Guide

In the Matching Configuration page, configure the following fields.


Index: It is a multi-select field. The user can select multiple indexes from which they want to match the IOCs. The default value is ' All ' i.e. search in all the indexes.
Start Time: It is a Time-Range filter. The user can select the time from which they want to start the matching of the IOCs. The default value is the last 7 days. Note that this Start Time means from which date/time does the user wants to start matching the events, hence, this will be applicable on the first time of the configuration i.e. when the user saves the configuration for the first time, the app will start matching the events since the Start Time till the current time. Once this matching is completed, then the next subsequent matching logic will be invoked every hour automatically by the saved search and it will match the events from the last 1 hour.

Replication metadata gives you the time at which each replicated attribute for a given object was last changed. As a result, the timeline of modifications is partial. In order to be able to process this data with Splunk run the ADTimeline PowerShell script against your Active Directory domain as described on the project homepage.
After processing the ADTimeline script you should have two or three files to import in Splunk (%DOMAINFQDN% is the Active Directory fully qualified domain name):

timeline_%DOMAINFQDN%.csv: The timeline generated with the AD replication metadata of objects retrieved. The corresponding sourcetype is adtimeline.
ADobjects_%DOMAINFQDN%.xml: Objects of interest retrieved via LDAP. The corresponding sourcetype is adobjects.
gcADobjects_%DOMAINFQDN%.xml: If any, objects of interest retrieved via the Global Catalog. The corresponding sourcetype is gcobjects.

The app's ""Getting started"" page will give you the instructions for the import process.
Once the data indexed, the dashboards generated by the app will help the DFIR analyst to spot some Active Directory persistence mechanisms, misconfigurations, brute force attacks, security audit logging bypass, mail exfiltration… It will also help the analyst to characterize changes made in the Active Directory a long time ago if you do not have sufficient security eventlog history. 
The four dashboards available for the DFIR analyst are:

The “Active Directory Infrastructure” dashboard gives you general information on which components to investigate.
The “sensitive accounts” dashboard provides an inventory of the privileged accounts in the domain and accounts prone to common attack scenarios due to their configuration.
The “investigate timeframe” dashboard provides statistics and charts of modification occurring on the AD domain for a given period of time. Use this dashboard if you already know what timeframe to investigate. 
Finally, the “track suspicious activity” dashboard tries to spot malicious modifications made on the Active Directory such as ACL edition, group membership modification, various persistence techniques, Audit policy modifications, DCShadow operations, Replication metadata tampering, Exchange on premises Email exfiltration…",Version 1.1.1,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/d143b15e-24ce-11eb-9d3c-0a7b70f2f7b0.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html,892,0,splunk,5,1,Leonard SAVINA,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/ldap389,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise

New in Version 0.2: 
port is now taken from the forwarderquery.conf, alternatively user port=""xyz"" to override
new parameter method, defaults to GET, can set it to method=""POST"" in order to perform stuff like a restart
updated dashboard now shows the deploy-poll server(s) 
pending: the xml output should be passed in _raw not xmlresults for ease of use.
New in Version 0.3: 
Add a file via oneshot
New in Version 0.4:
contains a new command to perform rest calls on a list of hosts. Also allows to post data and can also call a DELETE action for eliminating endpoint configs. New UI for checking the connection to forwarders via REST, check the deploy-poll settings and - whee! - a browser for the remote filesystem.

Topology and Setting up Splunk Environment

This app has been distributed in two parts.

1) Add-on app, which runs collector scripts and gathers data from EMC XtremIO cluster, does
     indexing on it and provides indexed data to Main app.
2) Main app, which receives indexed data from Add-on app, runs searches on it and builds
     dashboard using indexed data.

This App can be set up in two ways:

Deploy to single server instance
Standalone Mode: Install  main app and Add-on app on a single machine.
 * Here both the app resides on a single machine.
 * Main app uses the data collected by Add on app and builds dashboard on it

Deploy to distributed deployment
Distributed Environment: Install main app and Add-on app on Indexer and only Add-on app on forwarder system. 
 * Here also both the apps resides on Indexer machine.
 * Only Add-on app required to be installed on forwarder system.
 * Execute the following command to forward the collected data to the Indexer.
   /opt/splunk/bin/splunk add forward-server <indexer_ip_address>:9997
 * On Indexer machine, enable the event listening on port 9997 (recommended by Splunk).
 * Main app on search head/Indexer uses the received data and builds dashboard on it.

Introduction
The ITM6 App for Splunk can be used to index or view information from multiple ITM6 systems into Splunk using ITM6's SOAP and REST interfaces.
The app provides modular inputs that can be used to index ITM6 data, and commands which enable the display of data from ITM without indexing.
Please note that this app is installed at your own risk.  I only have a limited amount of time to devote to its development and can only complete a limited amount of testing.  Please enure you are happpy with its functionality in a non-production environment before installing in production.
Requirements


The TEPS dashboard data provider is required for most dashboards within the app, therefore it is recommended that ITM 6.3 is used at a minimum.


Splunk Enterprise version 6.3 is recommended for full functionality.


On Splunk versions < 6.3 only administrators can access the TEMS configuration endpoint in Splunk.  This stops non-admins from using the itmsoap and itmdash search commands.


The agent health modular input uses a KV store to store the most recent health results.  Therefore version 6.2 is required if you intend to use this feature.


Splunk must be able to communicate on port 1920 and 15200 with any ITM6 environment you add to the app.


Installation instructions

Download the application installation file (ITM6.spl)
Use the install app from file option in Splunkweb

Configuration/Usage instructions
Add the TEMS server details of the environment you wish to manage:

From your Splunk Enterprise homepage navigate:
   ITM6 > Settings > Manage TEMS Connections > New
Fill in the details for your TEMS

Collect data from ITM6:


Navigate to data Inputs:
    Settings (Top right menu) > Data inputs


Choose 'ITM6 Dash Input', 'ITM6 Object Input' or 'ITM6 SQL Input'
Which should I choose?

Dash
Can get data from TDW
Drop down lists when choosing input
Uses more resource on the TEPS than SOAP


SOAP (Object)
returns human readable field names
can pull local historical data


SOAP (SQL)
more flexibility over what you query
offers the ability to time out the query and the TEMS
can pull local historical data





Display ITM data without indexing it:
The itmsoap and itmdash search commands provide a link to the TEMS SOAP and the TEPS dashboard data provider interfaces.  The dashboard data browser dashboard can help with generating search commands for itmdash, however knowledge of the ITM interfaces is required to use these commands.
itmsoap
The itmsoap command enables you to run the CT_GET method against your TEMS from a Splunk search command.
Documentation on CT_GET can be found here
usage:
itmsoap tems=$tems$ [sql=$sql$ | fields=$field,...$ table=$table$ at=$All|All Hubs|All Remotes|tems name$ nodelist=$agent|msl$ [clause=$where clause$] [timeout=$secs$] [timefield=$timefield$] | object=$object$ target=$target$ [attribute=$attribute,...$] [afilter=$condition,...$] [timefield=$timefield$]
examples:
Get the agent list from the TEMS server.
| itmsoap tems=$tems sql=""SELECT NODE,VERSION,THRUNODE,O4ONLINE,PRODUCT,HOSTINFO,HOSTADDR,NODETYPE,RESERVED FROM O4SRV.INODESTS""
itmdash
The itmdash command enables you to query the TEPS dashboard data provider using a Splunk search command, if a timefilter has been applied by Splunk it will be applied to the search query sent to ITM.
Offical documentation for this endpoint is hard to find.
usage:
itmdash tems=$tems$ [endpoint=$endpoint$] [datasource=$datasource$ [dataset=$dataset$ [sourcetoken=$agent|msl$ [properties=$properties$] [condition=$condition$] [field_format=$label|id$] [earliest=now latest=now]]]]
examples:
The itmdash command can list the endpoints that are available on the TEMS, you can build up your itmdash command starting with just the tems parameter.
To list datasources
| itmdash tems=$tems | table label,id
To see the sourcetokens(agents) that can provide a datasource
| itmdash tems=$tems datasource=TMSAgent.%IBM.STATIC134 dataset=msys | table ""Origin Node""
Then datasets within a given datasource
| itmdash tems=$tems datasource=TMSAgent.%IBM.STATIC134 | table label,id
Add earliest=now and latest=now to query current ITM data only to reduce CPU cycles while testing your query.
Then add the sourcetoken you wish to query data from
| itmdash earliest=now latest=now tems=$tems datasource=TMSAgent.%IBM.STATIC134 dataset=MetricGroup.KLZCPU sourcetoken=$hostname:LZ
If you wish to limit the number of columns returned or use the condition parameter, you can view the available columns using endpoint=columns
| itmdash earliest=now latest=now tems=$tems datasource=TMSAgent.%IBM.STATIC134 dataset=MetricGroup.KLZCPU endpoint=columns | table label,id
Finally, a full command to get CPU usage from a Linux server and display in a Splunk timechart
| itmdash tems=$tems sourcetoken=$hostname:LZ datasource=""TMSAgent.%IBM.STATIC134"" dataset=MetricGroup.KLZCPU properties=""TIMESTAMP,ORIGINNODE,CPUID,SYSCPU,STEALCPU,WAITCPU,USRCPU"" condition=""CPUID=-1""
| timechart bins=1000 avg(User CPU (Percent)) AS User_%, avg(System CPU (Percent)) AS System_%, avg(Steal CPU (Percent)) AS Steal_%, avg(I/O Wait (Percent)) AS I/O_Wait_%
Healthcheck your environment:
The ITM6 Daily Agent Healthheck script is provided to help determine if your agents are in a healthy state.  This script is a work in progress, and has only been tested on a small environment.
Currently the script attempts to collect the operations log from all agents to determine if the agent is responsive.
1. Navigate to data Inputs:
    Settings (Top right menu) > Data inputs
2. Choose 'ITM6 Daily Agent Health Check'         
    A cron style Interval is recommended so you can choose the time that the healthcheck runs",Version 1.01,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/image/default_icon.png,IT Operations,http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html,395,0,splunk,4,2,Kieren Crossland,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/kierencrossland,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

It consists of a set of rules and dashboards for visualization of multiple security checks on Sysmon’s events of Windows hosts. It allows to detect anomalies (further analysis is needed to check if they are caused by malware, user's data leakage intentions, etc.).
Sysmon itself includes the following capabilities:
- Logs process creation with full command line for both current and parent processes.
- Records the hash of process image files using SHA1 (the default), MD5, SHA256 or IMPHASH.
- Multiple hashes can be used at the same time.
- Includes a process GUID in process create events to allow for correlation of events even when Windows reuses process IDs.
- Include a session GUID in each events to allow correlation of events on same logon session. Logs loading of drivers or DLLs with their signatures and hashes.
- Logs opens for raw read access of disks and volumes
- Optionally logs network connections, including each connection’s source process, IP addresses, port numbers, hostnames and port names.
- Detects  changesin  file  creation  time  to  understand  when  a  file  was  really created. 
- Modification  of file  create  timestamps  is  a  technique  commonly  used by malware  to cover its tracks.
- Automatically reload configuration if changed in the registry.
- Rule filtering to include or exclude certain events dynamically.
- Generates  events  from  early  in  the  boot  process  to  capture  activity  made  by even sophisticated kernel-mode malware.
Thus SYSMON Integration Framework Basic is able to provide multiple security checks on Sysmon’s events by SIEM:
- Ransomware or Data Leakage detection by alert of rapid creation of large number of new files;
- Detection of long commands (it may be obfuscated malicious code);
- Detection of processes that have cmd (powershell, cscript.exe, wscript.exe, rundll32.exe) as child process on workstations;
- Visualization of TOP non-browsers executables with direct connections to Internet;
- Anomaly detection: different files with the same hashes; rare system executable files (i.e. if cmd.exe differs on one host of your corporate environment).

 Indexer:         The inputs does not need to be configured on the indexer unless there is only one indexer in the deployment and no Heavy Forwarder. The TA contains index time conifgurations and should be installed on the Indexer.
* Search Head:    The inputs does not need to be configured on the Search Head. The TA does contain search time configurations and should be installed on the Search Heads.
Configure Nutanix Prism API Inputs
There are two ways to configure the inputs for this app:
Using the Web Interface:
On you Splunk Enterprise instance, navigate over to Settings —> Data Inputs —> and select the Nutanix Prism API endpoints you want to ingest into Splunk. For each input you want to add, select the endpoint then select new —> and fill out the required form. 
Input Form
The input form requires the following information from users:

name : Unique identifier the input 
username: The username for the Nutanix Prism API Console. The format should be: username@nutanixbd.local 
password: The password for the Nutanix Prism API Console. 
ip: The ip or hostname of the Nutanix Prism API Console. 
port: The Nutanix Prism API Console port. This defaults to 9440. 
start_time: This number should be in seconds. This signifies how far back for the current time you would like to retrieve data. By default the time is either 900 seconds or 3600 seconds depending on the input.

After successfully completing the input form, ensure to enable the input by navigating over to Settings —> Data Inputs —> Select the Input  —> Under Status —> Select Enable. By default, the host, source, index and sourcetype fields are configured. 
Using the configuration files:

Download the TA from Splunkbase : ENTER DOWNLOAD LOCATION
Add the TA to your Splunk App directory typically found under: $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps.
Create a local directory under $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-nutanix and add an inputs.conf file in the local directory. Using the inputs.conf.spec file located in the README directory as a guide, add the ip, username, and password of Nutanix Prism Console to each input. Please note, the username should be in the following format: username@nutanixbd.local. In addition,there are default time intervals, port numbers, and start_times set.  To override the default of any of these stanzas, create a new entry for each in local directory's copy of inputs.conf. Also, each input is disbled by default. To enable an input, add disabled = 0 under each input in the local directory's copy of inputs.conf.

Configure Nutanix Syslog Data 

Ensure that TA-nutanix is installed on the Splunk instance collecting the syslog data.
The index time and search time configurations for this TA are configured for the sourcetype nutanix_syslog. Ensure that the sourcetype for Nutanix syslog data is set to nutanix_syslog in your environment.",Version 2.2.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/f74f20d0-21f9-11ec-9c28-fe7bbb6d9553.png,IT Operations,https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,"2,013",0,splunk,4,2,Nutanix Technical Alliances,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/nutanixbizdev,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

Setting up

Install the Splunk app through the GUI or by extracting it to your apps directory and restarting Splunk.
Configure an alert through the normal means (GUI or savedsearches.conf) and add a slack_webhook_alert action with the following parameters:
slack_webhook: Slack Incoming Webhook URL
slack_message: Text of the Slack message to send. Slack formatting and \n for a newline are accepted, as well as Splunk token substitutions.



Note: If your saved search returns multiple events, this alert will only publish the first to Slack. To get around this, use the ""Once Per Event"" mode when configuring in SplunkWeb or alert.digest_mode=0 in savedsearches.conf.

See here for product details.
Much of the information required for the reports is extracted from audit log messages generated by Vormetric agents when user programs access files protected by a Guard Point, which is a directory protected by the Vormetric Filesystem agent. This requires that the Guard Point has been set up using a policy where the rules include an audit effect, and that the agent has been configured to send ""INFO"" level log messages to the Splunk system, either directly from the agent, or forwarded by the DSM.


If info-level audit logging of Guard Point accesses is not provided, the Splunk reports might not provide useful results.


The log streams provided to Splunk must in RFC5424 Syslog format, else field extraction will not work correctly. This is selected in the DSM when defining the syslog stream formats.


The reports and searches might not provide useful information until a sufficient volume of log events has been captured by Splunk.

Overview
This is a simple app that pulls together various views I've found to help monitor the license index usage.  It was born out of some frustration with DeploymentMonitor not providing accurate enough information for license usage in 5.0.1.
Additionally, it adds some useful views for finding missing forwarders, that DeploymentMonitor was not able to find.  Key functionality includes:
License Monitor

License Usage (Today and Yesterday)
Graph for daily license usage
Graph for hourly license usage
Per host/sourcetype license usage breakdowns.

Missing Forwarder

Identify missing forwarders
Analysis for identifying under-performing forwarders (and sometimes better at finding missing forwarders)

Thanks to:

Cory Wallace (): Helping provide some of the searches that the views are based upon.
Jason Timlin (): Updating the searches to be more accurate in 6.0+ environments

Install from Splunk web UI: Manage Apps > Browse more apps > Search keyword “Fortinet” > Click “Install free” button > Click Restart Splunk Service.
Install from file on Splunk web UI: Manage Apps > Install from file > Upload the .tgz file which is downloaded from https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app > Click Restart Splunk service.
Install from file on Splunk server CLI interface: Extract the .tgz file->Place the SplunkAppForFortinet folder under $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps > Restart Splunk Service.

3. Add data input on Splunk server:
Note: From version 1.2, the Splunk TA(Add-on) for fortigate no longer match wildcard source or sourcetype to extract fortigate log data, a default sourcetype fortigate_log(before 1.6, the default is fgt_log) is specified in default/props.conf instead, please follow the instruction below to configure your input and props.conf for the App and TA(Add-on).
Through Splunk Web UI:
Option1: Adding a TCP/UDP input
Settings->Data Input->UDP
Port: 514 (Example, can be modified according to your own plan) 
Sourcetype: fortigate_log (Example, can be modified according to your own plan but need to match the sourcetype stanza in props.conf)
Option2: Adding a file input
Settings->Data Input->Files & Directories
Browse: Select the file directory
Select sourcetype: if fortigate_log is not created yet, click Save As -> Name:fortigate_log
Leave others unchanged and save.
Note: the UDP port, 514 in this example should be opened in firewall for logs to pass through. If you choose TCP input and on FortiGate use ""reliable""(tcp) mode for syslog setting, you will need to add the following in local/props.conf because tcp tranported syslog will have xxx <yyy> header as line indicator.(8514 below is an example of TCP port, you can choose your own. There is no timestamp header like UDP so you can specify the timestamp field in the fortigate log, in our case the precision is in nanoseconds so the time format is %s%9N. If your FOS version has time stamp in different precision, refer to: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.1.1/SearchReference/Commontimeformatvariables)
[source::tcp:8514]
SHOULD_LINEMERGE = false
LINE_BREAKER = (\d{2,3}\s+<\d{2,3}>)
TIME_PREFIX = eventtime=
TIME_FORMAT = %s%9N
Fortinet FortiGate Add-On for Splunk will by default automatically extract FortiGate log data from inputs with sourcetype 'fortigate_log'. 
If you want to configure it to extract a self-defined sourcetype, copy the props.conf 
in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Splunk_TA_fortinet_fortigate/default/props.conf to 
$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Splunk_TA_fortinet_fortigate/local/props.conf and change the source stanza.
replace [fortigate_log] with [fortigate], for instance.
Note: Please use notepad++ to edit the configuration files if you are working on a Windows operating system. Windows's default Notepad can not display or save the configuration file in proper format.
If a customized index is used for the input, it also needs to be added in admin user's default authorized list of indexes to search.
In $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/authorize.conf
[role_admin]
srchIndexesDefault = fortigate;main
srchMaxTime = 8640000
In this example, fortigate is the index for my fortigate log input.
Restart Splunk service for the change to take effect.
4. Configure FortiGate to send logs to Splunk server:
config log syslogd setting (or 'config log syslogd2/3' setting if syslogd is occupied)   
set status enable   
set server ""x.x.x.x""   
set port 514 (Example. Should be the same as in data input of Splunk server)   
end
Note: If you are forwarding FortiGate logs from Fortianalyzer, please make sure you set the format to syslog instead of the default CEF format. If you would like to use TCP as transport protocol, please add 'set mode reliable' and refer to step3 above for TCP related configuration on Splunk side. 
5. Enable Data Model Acceleration:
Since version 1.5.0 of the app, data model acceleration is no longer enabled in default/datamodels.conf. User has to either enable data acceleration on Splunk GUI Settings->Data Models->Fortinet FoS Log.
Or on Splunk search head, where the app is installed, create ""local"" folder under $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SplunkAppForFortinet/ and create a file in this ""local"" folder named datamodels.conf with the following content:
[ftnt_fos]
acceleration = 1
acceleration.earliest_time = -1mon
6. Verify that logs are received on Splunk server:

At this point, you will see data parsed and presented on Fortinet Network Security dashboard.  

Fortinet FortiGate App for Splunk delivers the data visibility throughout Fortinet’s next-generation firewalls and the analysis for advanced security reporting without error prone manual process.  


7. (Optional)Extract time from FOS log:
There is eventtime field with the epoch time in FortiGate log in newer FOS versions(6.0 and later). To use it as the timestamp, you can add the following in local/props.conf under the stanza of the corresponding input.
If the eventtime field has 19 digits(FOS6.4 and later)
TIME_FORMAT = %s%9N
TIME_PREFIX = eventtime=
If the eventtime field has 10 digits:
TIME_FORMAT = %s
TIME_PREFIX = eventtime=
In FOS5.6 version, the field is called logtime, so change TIME_PREFIX accordingly:
TIME_FORMAT = %s
TIME_PREFIX = logtime=
8. (Optional)Reduce Log Volume:
Splunk Enterprise sends unwanted incoming events to nullQueue to discard them during data routing and filtering. To set up this filter, you can add the following regex in local/props.conf of fortigate add-on Splunk_TA_fortinet_fortigate.
Example:
TRANSFORMS-force_sourcetype_fortigate = setnull,force_sourcetype_fortigate
Also add the following regex in local/transforms.conf of fortigate add-on Splunk_TA_fortinet_fortigate.
[setnull]
REGEX = <expression for the filter here> (Example: REGEX = policyid=57)
DEST_KEY = queue
FORMAT = nullQueue
Please restart Splunk service for the change to take effect.
9. (Optional)Using Syslog-NG to send FortiGate Logs to Splunk Cloud:
9a. Configure syslog-NG
1. Disable rsyslog: sudo dpkg –purge rsyslog
2. Install syslog-NG: apt install syslog-ng
3. Configure syslog-NG, add following content to /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf
    @version:3.5
    # syslog-ng configuration file.
    source s_network {
    udp(port(5514));
    };

    #Destinations
    destination d_all { file(""/var/log/fortigate/$HOST/$YEAR-$MONTH-$DAY-catch_all.log"" create_dirs(yes)); };

    # Filters
    filter f_all {
    };

    # Log
    log { source(s_network); destination(d_all); };
4. Restart the syslog-NG service: service syslog-ng restart
9b. Configure the Fortinet devices to point their syslog to the syslog-NG
Add the following CLI to Fortigate to send syslog to syslog-NG
config log syslogd setting
set status enable
set server “<ip of syslog-NG server>”
set port 5514
end
9c. Configure the Splunk Universal Forward on the syslog-NG server
1. Install the Splunk Universal Forwarder
Refer to: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Forwarder/8.2.2/Forwarder/HowtoforwarddatatoSplunkCloud?ref=hk#HowtoforwarddatatoSplunkCloud#How_to_forward_data_to_Splunk_Cloud
2. Configure the Splunk Universal Forwarder
Add data source to /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/search/local/input.conf
    [monitor:///var/log/fortigate/*/*.log]
    sourcetype = fortigate_log
    disabled = false
3. Install Fortinet FortiGate Add-on for Splunk in Splunk cloud.
Through Splunk cloud web UI:
Apps-> Find More Apps-> Search keyword ‘Fortinet’ and find the add-on with Fortinet logo -> Click “Install” button
4. Restart Splunk Service
Troubleshooting

Check whether FortiGate FOS is 5.0 version or later.
Go back to Configuration Steps to double check if every step has been followed.
Make sure port 514 in this case is opened on firewalls throughout the log's data path.
Double-check Splunk server and FortiGate devices are synchronized in time.
Make sure traffic logging is enabled in policies on FortiGate configuration, for example:

config firewall policy   
edit 1   
set logtraffic all   
end   
end

If you see graphs on first page - Fortinet Network Security but there is none on rest of the dashboards, you can try to extend the time range. If there is graph after increasing the time range, the probable cause is data model is not accelerated completely yet. You can verify this by looking at Settings > Data Model > Fortinet FoS Log. Expand. If the percentage is low, it means Splunk server is limited on resources. It may take some time for the data model acceleration to catch up.
Sometimes, the logs received by syslogd can be transformed and would not match the regex in the app, so no data will be shown on dashboards. Here are the regex in transforms.conf of fortigate add-on Splunk_TA_fortinet_fortigate.

REGEX = ^.+?devid=\""?F(?:G|W|\dK).+?(?:\s|\,|\,\s)type=\""?(traffic|utm|event|anomaly)
Make sure the log can match those regex. If not, you can also make slight change on the regex to fit the log.
Please note in FOS 5.6 version, the type field includes """", so in order for the fortigate logs to be recognized, please upgrade Fortinet FortiGate Add-on for Splunk to 1.5 version.
   The App only supports logs from FOS 5.0 and higher versions. Older versions have different log format so you might probably encouter problems.
   If still no luck getting the dashboards to show anything, please try searching for ""host=x.x.x.x"" where x.x.x.x is the IP or the hostname of the machine reporting the log, if there are any results with sourcetype=fortigate_traffic, fortigate_event or fortigate_utm, you just need a little bit of patience, if not, please take a screenshot and send it to the email below.

Infoblox DDI is a popular DNS, DHCP and IPAM (DDI) system. OOTB there are integrations (via add-ons) with Splunk which provide information about DHCP and DNS services, but there are no IPAM data flows. Luckily, Infoblox (actual product name is NIOS) provides a good REST API that can be used to overcome this gap.
TA for Infoblox IPAM
This custom technical add-on for Infoblox APIs was built using the Splunk Add-on Builder app (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2962/). The add-on should be installed on your Heavy Forwarders/Indexers and your Search Head instances.
There are three main inputs that can be configured in the TA on your Heavy Forwarder/Indexer:
- /record:host - this lists all host records (from DNS)
- /record:host_ipv4addr - this lists all IPv4 addresses
- /network - this lists all network segments available in IPAM + extended attributes (e.g. location)
REST API URL is usually found at: https://<your_infoblox_instance>:443/wapi/v2.7
For authentication the add-on uses Basic Auth mechanism. Read the API docs here: https://docs.infoblox.com/download/attachments/8945695/Infoblox_RESTful_API_Documentation_2.9.pdf for further details.

Troubleshooting
The TA logs are sent into the ""_internal"" index by default. You should perform a search like the following:
index=_internal source=""/opt/splunk/var/log/splunk/ta_infoblox_api*""
This search will return the contents of the TA logs for the time range you select.
Note that if you see some errors mentioning ""next page id"" this will be normal, because this means that the input has reached the end of the list of items returned by the API. Anything else deserves to be investigated.",Version 1.0.4,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/9af52d84-0de1-11eb-9789-06add55d78f8.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://www.bright.consulting/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Bright-Splunk-App-End-User-License-Agreement.pdf,167,0,splunk,0,0,Bright Consulting Jsc,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/brightconsulting,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

This app is for Splunk admins (on prem or BYOL iaas) 
Purpose
This app backups Splunk configuration files, kvstore, state + additional scripts if used
Use Cases

Compare current configurations (searches, dashboards, lookups or any other ko ) with a previous versions
Extract and reinject specific ko (exemple : lookup that was accidentaly removed via outlookup command)
Ability to recover from a hardware failure to the last backup 

This app purpose is not to backup indexed data
Target components :

Standalone 
Search Head(s)
Deployment Server(s)
Heavy Forwarder(s)
Monitoring Console
License Manager
Cluster Manager

App normally not needed on :
 indexers (because they just redownload their apps from the cluster master)
 UF (as they will redownload their apps from DS) (and they usually are covered by other backup solutions when on data sources)
Topology support
The following topologies are supported :
 local only backups (will always do by default)
 remote on a object store (s3 or GCS) via automatic tag/metadata detection in AWS/GCP (will automatically discover bases on instance tag)
 remote on object store statically configured
 remote on a mounted point (need configuration, use for on prem deployment)
Installation requirements :
Splunk Versions : 6.x to 8.x
app will autonatically switch to kvdump when 7.1+ detected
Linux OS (heavily rely on bash scripts)
unpriviledged installation (ie splunk not running as root) 
specific to iaas env for remote backup to object store :
 * cloud SDK (AWS SDK for AWS, GCP SDK for GCP,...)
 * splunks3backupbucket tag or metadata to contain bucket name
 * iam role to allow the instance to write backup in the target location
 * lifecycle policy on the bucket to remove old versions (ie old backups)
specific dependency on monitoring console host only
 timeline visualization app from splunkbase to light up the dashboard ( https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4370/#/overview)
Installation order :

Provision local disk space for backups
deploy the app on one host, change/customize settings if you need (defaults should be fine for most people) by creating a local copy of splunkconf-backup.conf files and just set the settings you want to override (do not copy everything as that would impact upgrades)
edit the splunkconf-backup-expected lookup (for example via lookup editor) to match the list of hosts you are expecting backups for (for dashboard usage)
push the app via usual splunk mechanisms (gui, Deployment Server, ...)
wait for next hour for backups to have been launched (see cron)
test and validate backups local and remote are being produced
consider using the monitoring console check to alert you when backup fails

Known Issues :
There are no known issues at this time.
Upgrade :
No special instructions for upgrading this app to a newer version.

The purpose of this is app is to provide dashboards and metrics to aid in increasing the engagement of attackers on your SSH honeypot. The goal of the metrics is to allow you to observe the behavioral changes of the attackers when configuration changes are made to the honeypot. By increasing the engagement level of your attackers you should be able to obtain higher quality threat intelligence than a default installation while still remaining low-interaction.
Details
In order to fully utilize the visualizations in Engaged Threat you will need to install the ""Sankey Diagram - Custom Visualization” App located here - 
https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3112
Next install the “Virustotal Checker” Splunk app by following the link below. This will allow you to pull in Virus Total information for the files downloaded on your honeypot.
https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2671/
Restart Splunk after you’ve installed the above apps.
Key Notes
The Engaged Threat Splunk App is built using the JSON logging from Cowrie SSH Honeypot. Cowrie is an SSH honeypot that was forked from Kippo by Michael Oosterhof and can be found here.
https://github.com/micheloosterhof/cowrie
For Cowrie JSON logs to be indexed by Splunk it is suggested that you install the Splunk Universal Forwarder script for Engaged Threat by following the installation instructions here. 
https://github.com/jamesbower/EngagedThreat
Using the Engaged Threat Splunk App
When you open up the Engaged Threat Splunk App you’ll be taken to the “Overview” section of the app by default. You will see that the app contains three other sections. The second section is “Session Analysis” and the third is “Session Engagement”. The fourth and final section of the app is the typical Splunk “Search” section. An synopsis of each section is provided below.
Overview
The “Overview” section provides some key analytics consisting of the following.

Successful Sessions
Human Attackers
Bots
Average Session Duration in Minutes
Percentage of New Sessions 
Bounce Rate
Chart of New Attackers vs Returning Attackers
Top Successful Commands
Top Failed Commands

Session Analysis

Successful Sessions with Interaction
Session Flow
Cyber Kill Chain
Commands Entered During Session
Session Duration in Minutes
Files Downloaded During Session

Session Engagement

Unique Sessions
Commands
Unique Session Duration
Session Window Size
Top Session Flow Over 24 Hours

To-Do

Provide A/B Split testing of multiple sensors with different configurations.
Find a better way to calculate “Successful Sessions”.
Speed up queries and overall speed of the app.
Add the ability to manage remote sensors.
Expand Cyber Kill Chain integration.

Known Issues
Depending on the time frame used the “Average Session Duration” query takes a long time to calculate. I’m hoping to speed this up in the future.

TROUBLESHOOTING
General Checks

To troubleshoot Mandiant Advantage App For Splunk, check $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/Splunk/ta_mandiant_advantage*.log or user can search index=""_internal"" source=*ta_mandiant_advantage*.log query to see all the logs in UI. Also, user can use index=""_internal"" source=*ta_mandiant_advantage*.log ERROR query to see ERROR logs in the Splunk UI.
Note that all log files of this App will be generated in $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/Splunk/ directory.
If you notice that for a given time range, data of some Indicators is present in the index but not in mandiant_master_lookup then run the mandiant_update_master_lookup_from_index savedsearch in that time range.
If you notice no data is populated in security validation dashboards then ensure that macro mandiant_validation_indices has the correct indices mentioned in Dashboard Settings.
App icons are not showing up: The App does not require restart after the installation in order for all functionalities to work. However, the icons will be visible after one Splunk restart post installation.
If you face any issue with the form after clicking Report an Incident button, try in incognito mode or clear the browser cache.

Data Collection

If data collection is not working then ensure that the internet is active (On a proxy machine, if proxy is enabled) and also ensure that the kvstore is enabled.

Correlation
Master Lookup

If it seems that all the data of indicators from the Splunk index is not available in mandiant_master_lookup, then execute the savedsearch mandiant_update_master_lookup_from_index manually over a larger time range to refill the lookup.

Custom Command

Check that indices of the collected Indicators data are stored in Indicator Indices parameter of dashboard settings.
Check that mandiant_master_lookup or mandiant_matched_lookup is not empty and also ensure that mandiant_update_master_lookup_from_index is enabled.
Check if user is using accelerated searches then all the selected datamodels must be accelerated.
Check ta_mandiant_advantage_mandiantmatchindicators.log file for further analysis.

CloudKnox Add-on for Splunk, which collects data from CloudKnox using REST API calls.
CloudKnox App for Splunk, which adds dashboards to visualize the CloudKnox data



This app can be set up in two ways:

Standalone Mode:
Install the CloudKnox App for Splunk and CloudKnox Add-on for Splunk.
The CloudKnox App for Splunk uses the data collected by CloudKnox Add-on for Splunk and builds dashboards on it.


Distributed Environment:
Install the CloudKnox App for Splunk and CloudKnox Add-on for Splunk on the search head. User does not need to configure an account or create an input in CloudKnox Add-on for Splunk on search head.
Install only CloudKnox Add-on for Splunk on the heavy forwarder. User needs to configure account and needs to create data input to collect data from CloudKnox platform.
User needs to manually create an index on the indexer (No need to install CloudKnox App for Splunk or CloudKnox Add-on for Splunk on indexer).





INSTALLATION
CloudKnox Add-on for Splunk can be installed through UI using ""Manage Apps"" > ""Install app from file"" or by extracting tarball directly into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ folder.

This modular input makes an HTTPS request to the GitHub Enterprise's Audit Log REST API endpoint at a definable interval to fetch audit log data.
Prerequisites

Splunk Heavy Forwarder v8.0+
Python 3.7+
GitHub Enterprise Cloud

Installation


Download the latest release from Splunkbase


On a Splunk Heavy Forwarder, go to Apps > Manage Apps.


On the Apps page, click Install app from file, and upload the SPL file you downloaded from Splunkbase. If an existing copy of the app already exists, please check the Upgrade app checkbox.


Generate a Personal Access Token in GitHub Enterprise with the site_admin scope.


Configuration
Personal Access Token Scope
The following are the required scopes for the personal access token allowing the module to fetch the audit log entries successfully:

[x] admin:enterprise Full control of enterprises
[x] manage_billing:enterprise Read and write enterprise billing data
[x] read:enterprise Read enterprise profile data

Input Fields


name


This is name of your instance. You can have multiple modular inputs running simultaneously. However, this is not a recommended behavior for this module.

Takes: alpha-numeric, white spaces and symbol characters

Example: GHE-enterprise-name


Hostname


This is the hostname of your GitHub Enterprise instance. Make sure there are no leading http:///https:// or trailing / in the URL provided. This could either be a FQDN or an IP address. Do not append any paths beyond the tld.


Example: api.github.com


Enterprise


The enterprise name for which to fetch audit log events


Personal Access Token


This is your personal access token that you generate for your or a service account in GitHub Enterprise. This module requires that the personal access token be created with the site_admin scope. This is a very sensitive token so make sure to keep it secure at all times!

Security: The personal access token is encrypted and stored in Splunk's password storage. After you configure it the first time it will be replaced in Splunk's UI with a unique identifier. This identifier will be used by the module to fetch the personal access token before making the API request to GitHub Enterprise.
Takes: a 40 character token

Example: d0e117b6ad471der3rjdowcc401a95d09202119f


Event Types


The audit log contains multiple event types. This field allows you to specify which events to include:

web - returns web (non-Git) events
git - returns Git events
all - returns both web and Git events



More details


Maximum Entries Per Run


The maximum number of events / entries to fetch each time the script runs. To understand how to calculate the maximum number of entries and interval to best fit your organization go to the Tweaking throughput section below.


Verify Self-Signed Certificates


This is a parameter passed to the get() method in the Requests library. If the checkbox is cheked then the SSL certificate will be verified like a browser does and Requests will throw a SSLError if it’s unable to verify the certificate. Uncheck this box if you are using self-signed certificates.


Debug Mode


The personal access token will be leaked in the splunkd logs. DO NOT ENABLE unless you are ready to update your personal access token.


If you are experiencing issues and the module is not operating as intended, you can enable this mode to seethe module's debugging information in the splunkd logs.


Interval


Takes a cron expression as defined in the Splunk docs.

Example: 30 * * * *
At minute 30 of every hour. For example, if you set this CRON job at 11:02, your job will begin running at 11:30, 12:30, 1:30, etc...


Example: */5 * * * *
Every 5 minutes


Example: 300
Every 300 seconds or 5 minutes



Tweaking throughput
This modular input fetches events by calling the Enterprise Audit Log API. This API returns a maximum of 100 events / entries per page. The pagination algorithm can fetch events up to the maximum entries per run defined. It's important to tweak the maximum entries per run and interval parameters to have the ability to fetch your data in a timely manner and stay as close to real-time as possible.
Example:
| Enterprise   | Events per minute | Maximum entries per run | Interval    | API calls used | Guidance                                                                                                                                                               |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Evil-Corp    | 1000              | 1000                    | /1  * | 600 per hour   | The modular input should be able to handle this with ease.                                                                                                             |
| Poizen-Inc   | 5000              | 5000                    | /1  * | 3000 per hour  | We are approaching API rate limit per hour.  Depending on latency, 5000 entries = 50 API calls per minute.  One minute might not be sufficient to fetch all this data. |
| Monsters-Inc | 10000             | 2000                    | /1 ** * | 1200 per hour  | You will be fetching events with a slight delay.                                                                                                                       |
FAQs
How is my Personal Access Token secured?
On the first run the modular input will identify that your personal access token (PAT) is not encrypted. It will encrypt your PAT and store it in Splunk's credentials manager. It will replace the plaintext PAT with an md5 hash of an identifying key.
Your personal access token is only visible in plaintext from the time you configure the modular input instance until the first run.
Does the interval field access only cron syntax?
No, you can enter the number of seconds instead.
I enabled debug mode, what now?
If you've enabled debug mode be ready to change your personal access token because it will most likely be leaked into the Splunk logs in plain text.
Why can't I use a GitHub app instead of a personal access token?
GitHub apps cannot be installed on the enterprise level. The REST API requires enterprise admin privileges which are out of scope for GitHub apps.
Can I use this with GitHub Enterprise Server?
This tool has been designed to consume the Enterprise Audit Log API which is not available for GitHub Enterprise Server because the audit log on the latter can be forwarded via log forwarding directly to Splunk without the need to poll for data.
Support
Support for Github Audit Log Monitoring Add-On for Splunk is run through Github Issues. Please open a new issue for any support issues or for feature requests. You may also open a Pull Request if you'd like to contribute additional dashboards, eventtypes for webhooks, or enhancements you may have.

This Splunk app will parse O2 Wireless box (Technicolor TG582n - O2 8.4.4.J.AE) syslog data and will provide global dashboard views.
This requires some ""advanced"" knowledge of Splunk and your O2 Wireless box, both extensively available publicly.
To install:

Extract to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/
Reconfigure as per below
Not tested on Splunk for Windows, inputs.conf will need to be adapted


Restart Splunk

O2 Router Configuration details
You will need to reconfigure your O2 Wireless box as follows.
If Syslog is not active then configure Syslog as follows after login in to your router via Telnet using the command below
:syslog config activate enabled format welf timeout 0
:syslog ruleadd fac all sev debug dest <your_syslog_server_ip>

You will need to enable syslog for xDSL config as per below by default this is not enabled
:xdsl config syslog enabled

Syslog Server details
On your Syslog server, you should reconfigure so that data from your O2 router is logged into /var/log/o2router.log  
An example configuration using rsyslogd on an Ubuntu Linux system is shown below:
# provides UDP syslog reception
$ModLoad imudp
$UDPServerRun 514
# Specific format to use local time as on restart times are always set to Jan 1
$template O2FileFormat,""%timegenerated:::date-rfc3339% %HOSTNAME% %syslogtag%%msg:::sp-if-no-1st-sp%%msg:::drop-last-lf%\n""
# Log O2 Router Syslog to a separate file
:HOSTNAME, isequal, ""192.168.1.254""    /var/log/o2router.log;O2FileFormat
& ~

You should make sure your Syslog server adds the correct time as the O2 router on reboot loses it's time.
Additional O2 router App Configuration Details
For the detailed dashboard you will so need to configure the variables in o2router.conf
Make sure you place it in <app>/local/o2router.conf to avoid overwrite during app upgrades:
[o2router]
host = 192.168.1.254
username = SuperUser
password = YOUR_SERIAL_NUMBER_GOES_HERE

These variables should be self-explanatory. And of course don't forget to replace with the correct password.
This will use a scripted input that connects regularly to your O2 device and extracts detailed xDSL info

This add-on for Splunk can be used to monitor certificate transparency logs.
For example to watch certificates issued for your domains or malicious look-a-likes.
It outputs the certificate logs as CIM compliant events in Splunk. This allows you to create an alert in Splunk or Splunk Enterprise Security that fires when a certificate gets issued for your-domain-suspicious-fishing-domain dot tld.

Current RFC6962 compliance
Chapter 5.3 of the RFC specifies a number of steps that a monitor should implement.
Currently only steps 5 and 7 are partially implemented, and the current status can be summarized as: ""It gets logs. Period.""

Fetch the current STH


2
n
Verify the STH signature


3
n
Fetch all the entries in the tree corresponding to the STH


4
n
Confirm that the tree made from the fetched entries produces the same hash as that in the STH


5
Y
Fetch the current STH (Section 4.3). Repeat until the STH changes


6
n
Verify the STH signature


7
Y
Fetch all the new entries in the tree corresponding to the STH (Section 4.6).  If they remain unavailable for an extended period, then this should be viewed as misbehavior on the part of the log.



Because the current implementation lacks signature verification, it cannot be used to monitor the append-only character of the certificate transparency log Feel free to submit a Pull Request, or wait for future releases to implement these verification features.

The Power BI Log integrator modular input use MS PowerShell to access the audit logs based on your login. This is done by accessing Exchange Online.
A. In order to connect, your account needs to have an Exchange Online license assigned to it and you need access to the audit log for your tenant.
B. You can use the following versions of Windows as a Splunk Heavy Forwarder:
-Windows 10
-Windows 8.1
-Windows Server 2016
-Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2012 R2
-Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1) (*)
-Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 (*)
(*) You need to install the Microsoft.NET Framework 4.5 or later and then either the Windows Management Framework 3.0 or the Windows Management Framework 4.0. For more information, see Installing the .NET Framework and Windows Management Framework 3.0 or Windows Management Framework 4.0.
C. Splunk needs to be running under an account with elevated privileges to run PowerShell scripts.
Configure file monitoring and forwarding:
With Power BI Log integrator modular input you can filter the audit data by date range and it automatically download the activities to a CSV (comma separated value) file to analyze offline or forwarding to another Splunk server. NOTE: CSV file names are generated on epoch time format.
NOTE: If you don't specify a date range the script will automatically search records from last 24 hs.
Splunk can monitor and index the CSV files as new data appears.  If the specified directory contains subfolders, the monitor process recursively examines them for new files, as long as the directories can be read.
For instance with a Splunk Heavy Forwarder, you can forward the data onwards to a receiving indexer.  You'll need to configure outputs.conf and inputs.conf:
1. In outputs.conf
[tcpout]
defaultGroup = <group_name>
#Example:
defaultGroup = indexers
[tcpout:<group_name>]
server = <INDEXER_1>:<FW_PORT>, <INDEXER_2>:<FW_PORT>
#Example:
[tcpout:indexers]
server = 192.168.1.123:9997

First, identify the app that you would like to use for this add-on. As
mentioned, the app's indexed data  must have a field that contains an IP
address. If you do not have an app that  has been created, but you do
have data that has been indexed with an extractable IP address, you can use
the Splunk search app.
Look UP
Copy this add-on's bin/whois_lookup.py into your own app's bin directory.
Copy -R  this add-on's bin/whois library into your own app's bin directory.
Then, within the app's local directory (or default directory if you wrote
it yourself), copy the content of this add-on's default/transforms.conf into
your own transforms.conf file. If you do not have a transforms.conf, create
a new one in your apps's local or default directory
Search Usage:
*|lookup whoisLookup ip OUTPUT whois
This will create a new whois field for all events that contain an extracted
field called ip at search time. The whois field contains whois information
in JSON format created by the open source who is library. 
NOTE: Because there is no caching used here, it will not be a good idea to
send thousands of events to this lookup command as each event will make
an external call to the LOCATION_URL web site. It may be better to narrow
down your search such as:

Version 2.x and onward (OPTIONAL)
Version 2.x and onward adds support for the Redis key value database to cache
all responses from the whois lookup query. The theory is that the whois
response hardly changes for an address, so having a local cache of the data
speeds up the query. Here's what you have to do to use this version,
whois_redis_lookup.py
1) First, install Redis from http://redis.io/
You will need access to make (and possibly gcc). On a Mac, install XCode first.
2) Next, install the Redis Python Module, which produces an egg file.
https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py
3) Finally, in the whois_redis_lookup.py file, change the following lines:
Change: sys.path.append(""/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/redis-2.4.5-py2.6.eg
g"")
by putting in the absolute path to your redis...egg file.
Change: pool = redis.ConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
by putting in the name of your your host, port, and db, if different.
Start the redis-server. See the Redis docs on how to start it.
Now instead of using whois_lookup.py as described above in your transforms.conf
and lookup searches, you can now use whois_redis_lookup.py in its place.
Workflow Action
Copy the contents of the default/workflow_actions.conf into your own app's
local or default/workflow_actions.conf file. If you do not have such a file,
create a new one.
Usage: After retrieving data that has an IP address, use the field picker menu
on the UI to pick ip as a field to view on the events list. Then, under the
ip field in the events list, you will see a pulldown menu that will have
a new entry called whois. Click on this whois menu item to perform a whois
for this particular field value.
Note that if your extracted field is called something other than ip, you can
change the contents of workflow_actions.conf for this workflow action to use
your field extraction name instead of the word ip.",Version 3.0,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/6d94dfde-6900-11e3-b4de-005056ad5c72.png,IT Operations,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/,"3,770",0,splunk,2,6,Nimish Doshi,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/ndoshi_splunk,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

THERE SEEMS TO BE AN ERROR WHEN UPGRADING THROUGH THE GUI. EVERYTHING IS SET PROPERLY IN THE BUNDLE, SO I'VE OPENED A TICKET WITH SPLUNK SUPPORT TO HELP GET THIS RESOLVED. IN THE MEANTIME, YOU CAN UPDATE THE APP BY MANUALLY INSTALLING/EXTRACTING IT. WILL LET YOU KNOW ONCE THIS IS RESOLVED. THANKS.

This adds the tag ""fw"" and globally exports it. If you have anything existing named ""fw"", please either rename your existing ""fw"" to something else, or disable the tag in this addon by creating and then editing the file ""SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/netscreen/local/tags.conf"" once it's installed. Add the following:

[sourcetype=netscreen]
fw = disabled 

then save the file and restart Splunk to pick up this change.

This is a simple package that has much more robust and detailed extractions for Juniper Netscreen style firewall logs than I was able to find anywhere else. The main difference that I was never seeing in anything else available was that the timestamps being keyed off of were not those embedded in the FW messages themselves. This keys off of the ""start_time"" field for regular traffic; for other traffic it uses the timestamps embedded in the message text (usually near the very end of the line). All the fields extracted are based (where possible) on the documented Splunk CIM available online.
Note that these are written expressly for the log format that I was able to observe from our firewalls in testing. It's POSSIBLE that it may not conform exactly to your format, but as far as I'm aware, it should.
Also note that this adds an explicit sourcetype of ""netscreen"" for the data, so you may want to alias that if you use something else.",Version 1.6,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/image/default_icon.png,"Security, Fraud & Compliance",http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,"5,495",0,splunk,5,3,Timothy Meader,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/tmeader,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

=> INTRODUCTION
The Splunk App for PCAP files will express the pcap files into helpful charts by converting the files into a Splunk readable CSV file
=> NOTES ABOUT THE DATA
I have suffered from timestamp problems with PCAP files over 500MB. 
In case of big files I have split the pcap files into smaller files by using editcap.exe out of the Wireshark package.
-Index defined for the data: Default Index is choosed
-Sourcetype defined for the data:
-->sourcetype=pcap:csv
=>REQUIREMENTS

Wireshark (tshark) needs to be installed (available)

=> GETTING STARTED
Getting started - Requirements!
Step 1: Make sure the ../SplunkForPCAP/bin/ folder has all administrative privileges to execute the batch and shell script
Step 2: Make sure you have tshark installed (delivered with Wireshark)
Step 3: Make sure you have set SPLUNK_HOME variable
To allow Splunk to collect your PCAP Files you have to specify where you have stored your pcap files.
You can specify your location in the Data Inputs (via Settings) --> PCAP File Location.
The app checks every 3 minutes for a new pcap file in your specified folder.
You will recognize that after you can see your pcap file indexed in Splunk it is removed from your folder. The new location of the PCAP File is: $SPLUNK_HOME\var\log\pcap\PCAPConverted. That is happening to avoid that the automatic script converts your pcap file twice.
=> ROADMAP

Support for more protocols and more use cases
Dashboards will change to highlight the most important use cases for troubleshooting.

=> NOTES
- What is tshark? TShark is a network protocol analyzer. It lets you capture packet data from a live network, or read packets from a previously saved capture file, either printing a decoded form of those packets to the standard output or writing the packets to a file

The SecurityScorecard addon for Splunk offers customers the ability to monitor three components of the SecurityScorecard platform:

SecurityScorecard’s overall letter-grade security ratings, which give customers the ability to quickly and easily understand the cybersecurity posture of an organization via an easy-to-understand A-F rating scale
SecurityScorecard’s underlying factor data in key risk categories, including Application Security, Malware, Patching Cadence, Network Security, Hacker Chatter, Social Engineering, and Passwords Exposed. Each of these factors is predictive.For example, companies with a C, D, or F rating in Social Engineering are more than 400% more likely to experience a data breach than those with an A or B rating.
SecurityScorecard issue-related data, which offers a breadth and depth of critical data points across 87 different issue types not available from any other security ratings provider.

You can choose to monitor your own scorecard or third party scorecards or both.  Once the addon is installed, the addon will begin pulling scores and issue level event information on a daily basis and logging them to Splunk. You can leverage the power of Splunk to search, visualize, create alerts and take action, enabling you to efficiently monitor your own cybersecurity risk as well as the risk posed by your 3rd parties.

What can I do with the SecurityScorecard data?

Once our data begins flowing into your Splunk instance, there are numerous applications you can use it for. Some examples include the ability to:

Monitor and alert for changes in the overall & factor level scores on your own or 3rd party scorecards
Monitor and alert for new issues being added, removed or resolved on your own or 3rd party scorecards
Monitor and alert for new threats (malware events) and adverse score events

Additional you can merge:
 SecurityScorecard data with other private and 3rd party threat intelligence data you may be tracking.
 Internal cyber security event and log data with SecurityScorecard ratings and issue level event information (e.x combine your firewall log data with network security findings from SecurityScorecard).
On top of alerting capabilities, you can also leverage the power of Splunk’s visualization features to create dashboard with SecurityScorecard data included. Attached are some examples of the type of dashboards you can build to monitor for changes in scores and issue level events.


How does the addon fetch data and how often does it get new data?

The SecurityScorecard Splunk addon leverages the SecurityScorecard API to retrieve scores and issue level findings information, this is why the addon requires an API key as part of the setup process.  The SecurityScorecard Splunk addon gets fresh data every 24 hours.
When the SecurityScorecard Splunk addon runs, it will retrieve the following data points:

List of companies in any monitored portfolio’s (if portfolios have been configured)
For your own scorecard or third party scorecards
-- Overall score
-- Factor Level score
-- New changes detected in the scorecard from the previous day (Scorecard Event Log)


How do I install the addon?

SecurityScorecard’s Splunk addon is now available on Splunkbase.  
If you are upgrading from addon version 1.x or 2.0.x please see How do I Upgrade from 1.x or 2.0.x to 2.1.x? below. 
Otherwise sign into Splunkbase and download the latest version available.  Once you have downloaded the package:
To install apps and add-ons from within Splunk Enterprise

Log into Splunk Enterprise.
On the Apps menu, click Manage Apps.
Click Install app from file.
In the Upload app window, click Choose File.
Locate the .tar.gz file you just downloaded, and then click Open or Choose.
Click Upload.
Click Restart Splunk, and then confirm that you want to restart.

To install apps and add-ons directly into Splunk Enterprise

Put the downloaded file in the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps directory.
Untar and ungzip your app or add-on, using a tool like tar -xvf (on *nix) or WinZip (on Windows).
Restart Splunk.
After you install a Splunk app, you will find it on Splunk Home. If you have questions or need more information, see Manage app and add-on objects.

Once the addon is installed, you should see it on the left hand menu under Apps.


Are there any prerequisites for installing the addon?

Yes, please make sure you have completed the following steps before installing our addon:

Please make sure you are running at a minimum Splunk version 7.2
The application is built using python which should be included by default in Splunk

Please note: You must have an active SecurityScorecard license & API token in order to setup the addon.  If you do not have a SecurityScorecard license you can reach out to us at info@securityscorecard.io

Is your addon Splunk certified?


Yes, our addon has passed Splunk’s App inspect process. Going forward, we will ensure future versions of our addon pass the app inspect process before being made available to customers.

How do I Upgrade from 1.x or 2.0.x to 2.1?

Due to the change in how version 2.1.x app stores its API tokens, the version 1.0x and 2.0.x input configurations are no longer compatible. This means that to upgrade to version 2.1 app, you must either delete your current version 1.x or 2.0.x SecurityScorecard addon and reinstall new, or alternatively delete your input configurations and re-create them after performing the upgrade. 
Please note that in both cases you will need to re-generate your SecurityScorecard API tokens, unless you’ve kept a copy of your API tokens elsewhere.
To delete your current version 1.x or 2.0.x app and then install 2.1:

Backup your SecurityScorecard app Input configuration values. On Splunk enterprise you may do this:
-- by taking a copy of: $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-securityscorecard/local/input.conf
-- or simply by taking a screen capture of your app Inputs. 
Please note that you will not be able to take a copy of your API Tokens.
Delete your SecurityScorecard app. Please follow Splunk guides on how to perform this.
Install and configure version 2.1 app. Follow the How do I configure the addon instructions.

To delete your current version 1.x or 2.0.x input configurations and re-create them after version 2.1 upgrade:

Backup your SecurityScorecard app Input configuration values. On Splunk enterprise you may do this:
-- by taking a copy of: $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-securityscorecard/local/input.conf
-- or simply by taking a screen capture of your app Inputs. 
Please note that you will not be able to take a copy of your API Tokens.
Delete all SecurityScorecard app Inputs.
Install and configure version 2.1 app. Follow the How do I configure the addon instructions.


How do I configure the addon?

Once you have the addon installed, you can configure by launching the addon using the link on the left hand navigation on the home page. 

Once you open the addon you will see 3 tabs:


The inputs tab: Here you will setup what type of data you want to pull from SecurityScorecard
The configuration tab: Here you will setup global account(s) (versions 2.1.x onwards) for your SecurityScorecard API token(s), any proxy servers and the level of the logging capabilities of the addon.
-- By default the addon will store informational messages to logs, but you can increase or decrease the depth of information stored by the addon.  You only need to change this if you are experiencing issues with the addon.

Addon Configuration
Start by creating a new Account for your SecurityScorecard API token (only versions 2.1.x and onwards). 

If you do not already have a token, you can create one by going to the API Access area in your SecurityScorecard portal Settings page and then clicking Generate New Token. Please note tokens do not expire and you can re-use them over and over again. If you have a token and generate another one, the first token will no longer be valid and cannot be used for API calls.
Then create a new data Input. 

On the Input configuration tab you will be prompted to answer several questions regarding the type of data you want to log to your Splunk’s instance.  We have given you the maximum flexibility when it comes to logging data, you can choose the level of data you want to log about your own scorecard or that of third party companies:

For either your own scorecard or 3rd party scorecards, you will need to make a decision on the depth of data you want to monitor in Splunk.

Please note that if you are doing trend analysis, it would be best to log the overall score and factor level scores even if the score does not change, otherwise you will start seeing gaps in your graphs 
The fields you at least will need to fill in:

Name - The name of this configuration set.  
Interval - How often data should be pulled (in seconds). By default this is 86400 and you should leave this setting as is.
Index - The index where you want to log SecurityScorecard data to.
Domain Name:  If you want to monitor your own scorecard, you will need to provide the domain of your own scorecard.
Global Account (versions 2.1.x onwards): Account configuration that holds your SecurityScorecard API token.

How do I search for data?

Splunk allows users to search for data by leveraging Search Processing language (or SPL), if you are not familiar with SPL please check out the reference guide and other documentation first.   
Once the SecurityScorecard addon starts logging data to your Splunk instance, you can leverage SPL to query for the data.  Below are a couple of examples to help you get started.  
 Please note that your queries will return the data that is logged within the timeframe specified in the time range picker on the right side of the search box, if you are not seeing the data you are looking for please double check the time range to make sure it’s set correctly. As a reminder, the SecurityScorecard Splunk addon will retrieve new grades and event data based on your settings once every 24 hours.
 Please note Since 2.0.4 SecurityScorecard addon has followed CIM alert data mode and some of the search fields namings in of the earlier versions no longer work. The most relevant Field naming changes are Cat => Body,Domain => Subject.  
Example #1: Query for all data logged by SecurityScorecard
To query for all data logged by SecurityScorecard you can simply type in index=<INDEX_SPECIFIED_IN_CONFIGURATION> sourcetype=SecurityScorecard into the search bar.  This query will return all events logged by the SecurityScorecard addon.  
Example #2: Query for all data logged by SecurityScorecard at the overrall score level
To query for all scores logged at the overall level you can enter the following query: index=<INDEX_SPECIFIED_IN_CONFIGURATION> sourcetype=SecurityScorecard body=Overall into the search bar.  Additionally, if you want to filter to a specific domain you can do that by adding a domain to the search criteria like this sourcetype=SecurityScorecard body=Overall subject=securityscorecard.com
Example #3: Query for all data logged by SecurityScorecard at the factor score and issue level
You can query all factor level data by specifying Factor as the category index=<INDEX_SPECIFIED_IN_CONFIGURATION> sourcetype=SecurityScorecard body=Factor and similarly you can query for all issue level data by specifying Issue as the category index=<INDEX_SPECIFIED_IN_CONFIGURATION> sourcetype=SecurityScorecard boddy=Issue
Example #4: Query for all data logged by SecurityScorecard for a specific domain
If you want to filter on a specific company you can do that by specifying the domain in the query index=<INDEX_SPECIFIED_IN_CONFIGURATION> sourcetype=SecurityScorecard body=Overall subject=ibm.com
Example #5: Query for new malware logged by SecurityScorecard for a specific domain
If you want to filter on a specific company you can do that by specifying the domain in the query index=<INDEX_SPECIFIED_IN_CONFIGURATION> sourcetype=SecurityScorecard body=IssueFindings groupStatus=active issueType=malware_1_day subject=ibm.com
Example #6: Query for a specific malware family logged by SecurityScorecard for a specific domain (iotmirai in the example)
If you want to filter on a specific company you can do that by specifying the domain in the query index=<INDEX_SPECIFIED_IN_CONFIGURATION> sourcetype=SecurityScorecard body=IssueFindings groupStatus=active issueType=malware_1_day subject=ibm.com | rex field=_raw ""(?msi)(?<json_field>{.+})"" | spath input=json_field | search malware_family=iotmirai

How do I add a new third party company for monitoring?

If you want to start monitoring a new company after you have already setup the addon, you can simply add the third party company to one of the portfolio’s you included in the addon’s configuration.  Go to the SecurityScorecard platform and find the portfolio and add the third party company to this portfolio.  Data for this company will start getting logged in the next synchronization cycle.

How do I remove a existing third party company for monitoring?

To remove an existing third party company from monitoring, simply remove it from the portfolio in SecurityScorecard.  If you want to keep monitoring the company in the SecurityScorecard platform but not in Splunk, add the company to either a new portfolio or in an existing portfolio you did not include in the addon’s configuration.

Can I make configuration changes to the addon?

Yes you can, once saved, the configuration will be used the next time the addon runs and gets fresh data.

How do I uninstall the addon?

Please see Splunk documentation and recommended steps in  Manage app and add-on objects.

How do I get support?

If you have problems with the addon, please send an email to support@splunk.com.   Splunk will validate whether the issue is with the addon or with Splunk.  If the issue is with the addon please send us an email at support@securityscorecard.io.",Version 2.1.3,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/ca58d7c0-d018-11eb-bce7-06382f3616cf.png,"IT Operations, Security, Fraud & Compliance",https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,"1,305",0,splunk,4,1,Luke Household,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/lhousehold_ssc,"Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

This technology add-on app is to accompany the ClamAV app.

ClamAV (https://www.clamav.net/). ClamAV® is an open source antivirus engine for detecting trojans, viruses, malware & other malicious threats.
ClamAV is a registred trademark of Sourcefire, Inc. and Cisco Technology, Inc.

The author of this splunk app has no connection whatsoever with ClamAV, Sourcefire, and or Cisco. Other, than I think it's a f'ing cool product and no-one else has made a splunk app for its logs. :)
Getting Started
This app has been created to work correctly with a stand-alone, distributed, and cloud installs of Splunk. Read the install notes carefully below with your splunk platform in mind.
You will need two apps:
1. ClamAV     https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1798/
2. TA-ClamAV  https: <pending>
  a. (this app)  
New Install
This section is to install on a centralized or stand-alone splunk setup. 

Install ClamAV via Splunk UI.
Install TA-ClamAV via Splunk UI.
Read the index section, below, to enable your correct index settings.
Restart the Splunk server.

Upgrading this app

Run the upgrade via the Splunk App management UI.
Or use the correct update methodology depending on your distributed design.

Install for Distributed Splunk designs
For those who are running a distributed Splunk design or HA: ie separate forwarders, search heads, indexers, etc... Please follow these directions, depending on your design YMMV.  Please see this link for more instructions: [http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/Overview/Installingadd-ons]


Install this App on your Search head(s).

Do not enable the indexes.conf file.



Install this App on your indexer(s).

Enable the index and replication: =- indexes.conf
    [clamav]
    repFactor = auto



See the README.txt notes to install the ClamAV app.


Install for Splunk Cloud
I have not used Cloud yet. I believe you install this app via the UI.
Also install the ClamAV app via the UI.
Getting data
Syslog notes:
Now that your TA-ClamAV app is installed per your deployment model.
This app makes the assumption that your clamav logs are being sent over syslog using the sourcetype=""syslog"" with the key works ""freshclam"" and ""clamav"" in the syslog process field.
To enable Freshclam syslog logging:
- Edit the /etc/freshclam.conf file
- Make sure setting LogSyslog yes is enabled.
To enable clamav syslog logging:
I run my scans like this.
- /usr/bin/clamscan -i -r $SCAN_DIR $EXCLUDE --log=$LOG_FILE --stdout | logger -i -t clamav -p auth.alert
Mac OSX
To gather your clamXav logs on a mac OSX (tested on Yosemite). Make sure clamXav is logging for ""scan"" and ""update"" results in your clamXav preferences. Install the Universal Forwarder on a mac and enabled an inputs.conf entry for:
Note: Log location changes depending if you install clamXav manually or via the app store. You may need to validate where your Scan and Update logs are located at. Here are some possible examples:

[monitor:///Users/<yourusername>/Library/ClamXav/ClamXav-scan.log]
or
[monitor:///Users/<yourusername>/Library/Logs/clamXav-scan.log]
sourcetype=clamav
index=clamav
[monitor:///Users/<yourusername>/Library/ClamXav/ClamXav-update.log]
or
[monitor:///usr/local/clamXav/share/clamav/freshclam.log]
sourcetype=freshclam
index=clamav

Optional scans:
This app support PUA and DLP search results if they are enabled on your scans.
- ClamAV supports scans for DLP like credit cards and social security numbers.
- ClamAV supports scans for PUA.
 - See http://www.clamav.net/doc/pua.html for more information.
Index Notes:
ClamAV searches are set to look for data in index ""clamav"". This TA controls the input of data into the index for the ClamAV app. Lately Splunk does not want apps to create indexes be default, so thus you need to create the index file if you wish to use an index.
Create index file

Create file ""indexes.conf"" in the TA-ClamAV/local/ directory on your indexer.
Cut and paste the below data into the file.
Restart splunk.

Note: Splunk Cloud users please use the Cloud UI settings to create the ""clamav"" index.

[clamav]
repFactor = auto    #only use this option if you have a splunk index cluster.
coldPath = $SPLUNK_DB/clamav/colddb
homePath = $SPLUNK_DB/clamav/db
thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/clamav/thaweddb

Use the default index
If you are choosing not to use the ""clamav"" index and thus the default ""main"" index, please follow these steps.

Delete the local/indexes.conf file.
Change index name in default/macros.conf:
   a. ""definition = index=main""
Restart the Splunk server.

What's in 1.0.1!

Verified works with Splunk 6.5 & 6.6.
Updated to work with Splunk Cloud.
Validated app through Splunk App builder.
Fixed macro issue with distributed design. Added distsearch.conf file.

What's in 1.0!
New TA app!

Works with Splunk 6.4.
TA for distributed Splunk designs.

The Splunk App for VulDB integrates vulnerability intelligence from VulDB into Splunk. The app communicates with VulDB by using its API and requires a valid API key as well as sufficient API credits.
Setup
Installation
Installation from file:
- Log in to Splunk with an administrative account
- Click on the gear icon (Manage Apps)
- On the next screen, click on the button labeled Install app from file
- Click on the button Browse... and browse to the location of the the VulDB Splunk App file (VulDB-Splunk-App.tar.gz), then select that file and click Open in the file browser dialogue. Now the name of the file appears next to the button Browse....
- Check the checkbox Upgrade app to upgrade any older versions of the app should they exist
- Click the button labeled Upload
Online installation:
- Log in to Splunk with an administrative account
- Click on the gear icon (Manage Apps)
- Click on the button Browse More Apps
- in the search box, enter VulDB and press enter
- Click on the button Install to install the VulDB App
Initial Configuration
Before configuring the VulDB Splunk App for the first time, make sure that you have a valid API key and a sufficient amount of API credits. If in doubt, log in to your VulDB account and check your profile.
The VulDB Splunk App defines a new modular input type that is used for retrieving data from VulDB. Navigate to the menu Settings / Data inputs and click on + Add new.
Note: if the app has been configured previously, this step is typically not required as the necessary configuration should already be present.
Give the new modular input a name, for example VulDB-datasrc and insert your API key into the field ""VulDB API key"". Optionally, you can specify a proxy server for outgoing connections, i.e. connections to https://vuldb.com from your Splunk server. You can also choose the language for the data fetched from VulDB, the choices are:

English
German
Spanish
French
Italian
Polish
Swedish
Chinese
Japanese

It is possible to define how far from the past the App should start fetching VulDB data (default setting is one month if left empty).  
Clicking on Next will save your configuration and download an initial chunk of data from the VulDB (see below).
Additional Information
The VulDB Splunk App downloads data from https://vuldb.com in several chunks and it checks for new data once per hour. Upon initial data download (i.e. no data has been downloaded previously or only a long time ago), the App attempts to download all data from VulDB that is younger than the configured maximum data age.
Note: this will consume roughly 1000 API credits per month of data coverage (or more), depending on your choice of fetching details and on the amount of vulnerabilities in VulDB for that period.
Usage
When you access the Splunk App, you are presented with an overview dashboard. This dashboard shows some statistics and visualizations of the VulDB data present in your Splunk instance. All visualizations in the overview have drilldowns defined, i.e. clicking on the numbers or graph elements will open a new window containing relevant data and details.
Dashboards
Some predefined dashboards are included with the app. They can be accessed through the menu Dashboards in the menu bar.
You can always add your own dashboards or alter the existing ones. If you choose to change any of the predefined dashboards be aware that this may lead to non-functioning drilldowns in other dashboards.
Reports and Saved Queries
Currently, only one saved search is included with the VulDB app - it will show the VulDB log entries. Feel free to add your own searches as you see fit.
Custom Searches
The VulDB app creates Splunk entries with a sourcetype of VulDB. Therefore you can use sourcetype=VulDB to restrict splunk searches to VulDB data.
Logging
The VulDB App logs events to the splunk logs. A saved search is included in the VulDB app that allows you to retrieve the VulDB App logs, please click on the Reports menu access the saved search.
Changing the Splunk App Configuration
The configuration of the VulDB data source (modular input) can be changed. Click on Settings / Data inputs / VulDB, which will show the previously defined input (or an empty list if you haven't defined the input yet). Clicking on the name of the input allows you to change its parameters.
Updating the App
For instructions on how to update Splunk apps, please refer to the official documentation.
Deleting the App
For instructions on how to disable or delete Splunk apps please refer to the official documentation. Bear in mind that deleting the app will remove the defined modular input but will not remove the VulDB data already present in your Splunk instance.
Fetching Individual Vulnerabilities
It is possible to download one or more vulnerabilities separately from the usual data retrieval mechanisms. Navigate to the menu Settings / Data inputs and click on the field Input Name of the previously defined VulDB data input. Enter the desired VulDB IDs in the field Fetch individual VulDB IDs. Separate multiple IDs with commas if you wish to download more than one vulnerability. Then click the Save button on the bottom of the page. This downloads the specified IDs from VulDB and then clears the Fetch individual VulDB IDs field.

Which moving parts are there?

| getsplunkversions which reaches out to doc.splunk.com to get a list of available splunk versions.
    Those are used within the ""Target Splunk Version"" drop down.
| checkappcompatibility target_version=x.x.x does the heavy lifting. It depends on a list of
    apps provided by splunks REST API | rest /services/apps/local but it is intentionally kept separated.
    To be able to reach out to the splunkbase API we need the ID's of the apps to check. Therefore
checkappcompatibility looks for that information within update.homepage. If there is no URL provided
    it tries to retrieve the ID using the app's title field.

How to use it?

You can use the provided dashboard which lets you check locally installed apps against a ""Target Splunk Version"".
You can use the CSC checkappcompatibility manually like that: | rest /services/apps/local | checkappcompatibility target_version=8.2.1
   if you have usecases not covered by the dashboard.
You can export the results of the REST call and ingest them into another splunk box to let the app check the
   status there. This comes quite handy if you prepare to upgrade an air-gapped splunk deployment. 

Are there limitations?

Sometimes splunkbase does not list multiple versions of an app. If your version is not listed, the compatibility
  can't be checked. The checker will therefore recommend to update to the most recent app version which supports your
  target splunk version.
Obviously there a couple of apps which are not listed within the splunkbase so they cannot be checked. They will marked
  as ""undecided"" (see belows screenshot).
This app is by no means a substitution of Splunk's python upgrade readiness app
  as it does not analyze any code. It simply reach out to splunkbase to check compatibility information listed there.
You technically could check deployment apps but the REST API call mentioned does only contain apps installed locally.",Version 1.0.1,https://prod.cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/06b112f4-548b-11ec-ad41-8640b36b5fa1.png,IT Operations,https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html,116,0,splunk,5,1,Daniel Glauche,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps/#/author/dglauche,"Products: Splunk Enterprise Products: Splunk Enterprise

 Splunk 6.3.x or above
 TM1 10.1 or higher
 Python 2.7
 SA-Eventgen (if using Demo Mode)
INSTALLATION:


Install app in Splunk Enterprise
    a. Navigate to ""Manage Apps"" then ""Install app from file""
    b. Select the "".tar.gz"" file containing the Perficient Splunk Plus TM1 Add-on and click upload
    c. Restart Splunk as prompted
    d. Fill in the setup screen as prompted
        i.  Check the box to ""Enable Demo Mode"" ONLY if you wish to use eventgen data, fed into the tm1_eventgen index.  This is based on the sample files located within the samples directory.  SA-Evengten will need to be installed in order to use this feature.
        ii. Enter the name of the index that the TM1 events should be indexed to.  Set this to ""tm1_eventgen"" if using demo mode
        iii.  Check the box for ""Distributed Environment"" ONLY if you are using forwarders to collect the tm1 logs located on the TM1 Servers.  For more details regarding distributed environments, please see section 5.
        iv.  Enter in the top level directory for where your TM1 instances are installed.  For example, if you have multiple TM1 instances on a single server, inside of C:\Program Files\TM1, you can just enter this in, and the configuration will search for and ingest all TM1 log files of interest inside nested directories.  In order for the automatic lookup to function properly, this path also should include the tm1s.cfg property file, for mapping the ServerName property to the tm1_instance field. For more details regarding the lookup tables, please see the Perficient Splunk Plus for TM1 Documentation.


Restart Splunk to apply configurations


Ensure TM1 is configured with the proper logging settings:
    a. TM1.Server events are required for calculating downtime and identifying restart events
    b. TM1.Process events are required for identifying process execution and status 
    c. Process error log files are required for the TM1 Error Investigation view
    d. tm1s.cfg property file(s) will need to be within the path specified during setup for Splunk to automatically map the ServerName property to the tm1_instance field


ONLY IF USING FORWARDERS - Install TA on Forwarder(s)
    a. Perficient_TA_TM1_FWD is generated in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Perficient_TA_TM1/appserver/addons
        i. This is a technology add-on for the forwarders.
        ii. Go into Perficient_TA_TM1_FWD/local/inputs.conf and add 'disabled = 0' to each stanza (to enable the inputs for the forwarder)
    b. Perficient_SA_TM1_IDX is generated in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Perficient_TA_TM1/appserver/addons
        i. This is a support add-on for the indexers (just basic definitions for interpreting data from forwarders)
        ii. No changes are required to this app.
    c. DO NOT CHANGE APP NAMES.
    d. After completing installation on Search Head:
        - All indexers (if using tiered architecture) need copy of ""Perficient_SA_TM1_IDX"".
        - All forwarders require a copy of ""Perficient_TA_TM1_FWD"" with inputs.conf ENABLED manually. (As noted in section 6.a above)
    d. If using a deployment server, copy Perficient_TA_TM1_FWD and Perficient_SA_TM1_IDX to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/deployment-apps and deploy to the 
       appropriate Splunk instances. Select the option to 'Restart Splunkd' when defining serverclasses.conf.
    e. If not using a deployment server, copy Perficient_SA_TM1_IDX and Perficient_TA_TM1_FWD to the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps directory of the
       appropriate Splunk instances. Restart each instance after files are copied.


Troubleshooting Notes and Tips:

If using forwarders, ensure Perficient_TA_TM1_FWDâ€™/local/inputs.conf are ENABLED (disabled = 0 in each stanza).
Make sure app names ""Perficient_TM1_App"",""Perficient_TA_TM1"",""Perficient_TA_TM1_FWD"", and Perficient_SA_TM1_IDX are NOT changed - there are dependencies in the scripts)
Make sure each instance of Splunk was restarted after receiving the app
Remember when using forwarders:
    During setup, click 'Distributed Splunk'
    During setup, give the parameters AS IF YOU ARE ON THE FORWARDER



Known Issues
    -Rerunning setup multiple times can produce unexpected results in the local .conf files

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4856,2022-01-10,08:34:13 AM,Metrics Add-on for Infrastructure,,"March 2, 2021","The Metrics Add-on for Infrastructure (TA-linux-metrics) can be used on Linux Forwarders to send Operating System metrics to Splunk without using collectd or the HTTP Event Collector (HEC) and it is fully compatible with the ""Splunk App for Infrastructure"":
https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3975/
Note: the output is formatted for multiple-measurement metric data points (Splunk v8.x only) which allows for significant license savings as a single metric data point can now contain multiple measurements and dimensions.
One of the most powerful features of the add-on is the ability to add custom dimensions to each metric.
Use the built-in Setup Page to configure the inputs on a Standalone Instance, or use a Deployment Server to push the add-on to your forwarders.
Compatibility

Splunk Enterprise v8.x
Splunk Universal Forwarder v8.x
Splunk App for Infrastructure v2.x
Linux: Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 20.04, Amazon Linux, CentOS 6, CentOS 7, CentOS 8, RHEL 6, RHEL 7, RHEL 8

Metrics

CPU
Memory
Swap
Load
Uptime
Filesystems
Inodes
Disk I/O
Interfaces
Processes

Custom Dimensions
You can configure the following custom dimensions and they will be added to all of the metrics as above:

cloud
region
dc
environment

Installation

Create a new 'metric' index on your indexer/s, e.g. metrics_linux

Example indexes.conf :-
[metrics_linux]
coldPath = $SPLUNK_DB/metrics_linux/colddb
homePath = $SPLUNK_DB/metrics_linux/db
thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/metrics_linux/thaweddb
datatype = metric



Install the add-on on your Linux servers and enable the inputs. Either use the built-in Setup Page, or copy the input stanzas from the default directory to the local directory (i.e. local/inputs.conf) and enable them as required:

Update: disabled = 0
Update: index = metrics_linux
Note: DO NOT UPDATE sourcetype = metrics_csv



If you enable process monitoring, configure the relevant processes to monitor for your environment. Copy the stanza from the default directory to the local directory (i.e. local/process_mon.conf) and configure them as required:
    [process_mon]
    allowlist = bash,zsh,sshd,python.*
    blocklist = splunkd


Note: allowlist and blocklist should be comma separated without spaces



Configure the relevant dimensions for your environment. Copy the dimensions from the default directory to the local directory (i.e. local/dims.conf) and configure them as required:


Note: you can set cloud to aws or gcp and the built-in scripts will auto-discover the Region and Availablity Zone of the instance, e.g.
[all]
cloud = gcp



Shell environment variables are also supported, e.g.
[all]
environment = $Deploy_Environment



Note: the region and dc do not need to be configured if cloud is aws or gcp, i.e. only set these dimensions if cloud = false




Install the ""Splunk App for Infrastructure"" on your Search Head


IMPORTANT: Update the 'sai_metrics_indexes' macro, e.g. index=metrics_linux

https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/InfraApp/latest/Admin/CustomIndexes#Use_a_custom_metrics_index_in_SAI





Troubleshooting


If you don't see any Entities under 'Investigate' in the Splunk App for Infrastructure :-

Update the 'sai_metrics_indexes' macro in the Splunk App for Infrastructure, e.g. index=metrics_linux



Error when enabling inputs via the Setup Page:
Encountered the following error while trying to update: Error while posting to url=/servicesNS/nobody/TA-linux-metrics/data/inputs/script/.%252Fbin%252Fcpu_usage.sh


Create a new 'metric' index before you enable any inputs



Run the following search to confirm that metrics are being indexed :-
| mcatalog values(metric_name)



If no results are found, run the following search and specificy your metrics index, e.g.
| mcatalog values(metric_name) WHERE index=metrics_linux



Add the 'metrics_linux' index to ""Indexes searched by default"" :-

https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Search/Searchindexes#Control_index_access_using_Splunk_Web





If you see similar errors to the following in 'splunkd.log' on the forwarder :-
11-10-2020 16:26:45.553 +1100 WARN  IndexProcessor - The metric name is missing for source=/opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-linux-metrics/bin/cpu_usage.sh, sourcetype=cpu_usage, host=foo, index=metrics_linux.

Ensure the input metric data is not malformed. raw=[""_time"",""metric_name:cpu.user"",""metric_name:cpu.system"",""metric_name:cpu.nice"",""metric_name:cpu.idle"",""metric_name:cpu.wait"",""metric_name:cpu.interrupt"",""metric_name:cpu.softirq"",""metric_name:cpu.steal"",""model"",""cloud"",""region"",""dc"",""environment"",""ip"",""os"",""os_version"",""kernel_version""]

11-10-2020 16:26:45.553 +1100 WARN  IndexProcessor - The metric value=<unset> is not valid for source=/opt/splunk/etc/apps/TA-linux-metrics/bin/cpu_usage.sh, sourcetype=cpu_usage, host=foo, index=metrics_linux.

Ensure that the sourcetype is set to metrics_csv and your forwarder is at least v8.x



If you have set ""allowlist = "" to monitor all processes but the ""process_usage.sh"" script uses 100% CPU and takes a long time to run, you may have hit a $PATH bug in one of your system profile scripts :-

Set the file mode on the script as follows, e.g.# sudo chmod 0750 /etc/profile.d/jdk.sh

In versions prior to 4.2 of Splunk UBA, both results and events were sent from the indexers to the search head, which was solely responsible for processing the events and keeping track of the number of events processed. Sending data directly to Kafka offloads the processing task from the search head to indexers. The search head still tracks the total number of events processed.
This method of data ingestion improves the performance of a single data source connection at the same time enhancing the reliability of ingestion. This in turn impacts the overall data quality within UBA leading to higher fidelity detections.
Kafka ingestion does not require UBA to run real-time indexed search queries on Splunk. Instead it uses something called micro-batched queries.
This app is installed on the Splunk search head. If your environment includes multiple search heads, install the Splunk UBA Kafka Ingestion App on each search head. If you have clustered Splunk environment then you can install this app on the search head cluster.
Add-ons installed on the search heads are automatically bundle replicated to the indexers when a search is issued to the search heads, which is the case for Kafka ingestion. This means all field extractions are also pushed to indexers, and there is no need to install the add-on on the indexers.

RECOMMENDED SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

Standard Splunk configuration of Search Head, Indexer, and Forwarder.

TOPOLOGY AND SETTING UP SPLUNK ENVIRONMENT


This app has been distributed in two parts.
1) Add-on app, which listens for Syslog messages from Illumio PCE and collects Illumio metadata using REST API Calls.
2) The main app for visualizing Illumio PCE data.


This App can be set up in two ways:


1) Standalone Mode:
Install the main app and Add-on app.


Here both the app resides on a single machine.
The main app uses the data collected by Add-on app and builds dashboard on it.

2) Distributed Environment: 
a) With heavy forwarder

Install the main app and Add-on app on search head. Add-on app on heavy forwarder.

* Configure Add-on app on heavy forwarder.
* The main app on search head uses the received data and builds dashboards on it.

b) With Splunk Universal Forwarder

Install the main app and Add-on app on search head. Add-on app on universal forwarder and indexer.

1. Configure Splunk Universal Forwarder to collect data from Illumio Server.
    * TCP SSL configuration
        * Create TCP-SSL stanza in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/inputs.conf file.
            ```
            [tcp-ssl://<PORT>]
            index=<INDEX-NAME>
            sourcetype=illumio:pce
            ```              
        * Then Create a SSL stanza in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/inputs.conf file.
            ```
            [SSL]
            serverCert = <path>
            sslPassword = <password>
            ```

            * To use Splunk default certificate add 
                ```
                [SSL]
                serverCert = $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/auth/server.pem
                sslPassword can be found in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/server.conf or $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/default/server.conf under [sslConfig]
                stanza
                ```
        * Restart Splunk.

    * If you are using on-prem Splunk instance and you want to configure TCP instead of TCP-SSL follow below steps:
        * Remove -SSL from TCP-SSL stanza in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/inputs.conf file.
        * Restart Splunk.


2. Configure the Splunk Universal Forwarder to send the data to Splunk Indexer.
    * Execute below command on SUF.
         * $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk add forward-server <IP>:<PORT> (Splunk Indexer IP and Listening Port)

3. Configure Splunk Indexer to receive data from SUF.
    * Create below stanza in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/inputs.conf file.
        ```
        [splunktcp://<PORT>]
        ```

INSTALLATION IN SPLUNK CLOUD

Same as on-premise setup.

INSTALLATION OF APP

Author: Hurricane Labs
Version: 1.0.0
Description
Provides CIM field extractions and other useful field extractions, as well as sourcetype transforming based on the event.

Currently Supports:
NetMotion Mobility Server Event Log (nmservic.exe)
https://help.netmotionsoftware.com/support/docs/MobilityXG/1130/help/mobilityhelp.htm#page/Mobility%2520Server%2Fmanage.07.014.html%23




Built for Splunk Enterprise 7.x or higher
CIM Compliant (CIM 4.15 or higher)
Ready for Enterprise Security

Constraints / Requirements

Requires the use of the Syslog as described here:
https://help.netmotionsoftware.com/support/docs/MobilityXG/1130/help/mobilityhelp.htm#page/Mobility%2520Server%2Fmanage.07.016.html%23


Requires that you onboard data with the sourcetype ""netmotion:mobility"" for it to be transformed and receive the appropriate fields.

INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
Installation Instructions

This TA should be installed on your Search Heads and the first Splunk Enterprise instance that touches the data (typically Heavy Forwarder(s) or Indexer(s))
Ensure Splunk Enterprise has restarted on the parsing instance before ingesting data
Data ingestion can be accomplished in many ways. Best practice would be to use a syslog solution that writes out to a file on disk that you monitor with a Splunk file monitor inputs.conf OR use SC4S. You can use the built in Splunk TCP/UDP listener, but this is highly discouraged.
Once TA installation and data ingestion have been completed, search your data with index=X sourcetype=netmotion:mobility:*
You should see many different sourcetypes appear. If you see netmotion:mobility as a sourcetype, then the TA was not installed on the parsing tier correctly or your data is formatted differently than expected (and will require a custom fix in local/transforms.conf).
