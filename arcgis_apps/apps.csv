It is an add-in to ArcGIS Pro (Basic, Standard or Advanced).EquiZone allows users to create and build zones that are
balanced based on the attributes of each polygon.  The application provides tools for redistricting...1) with attributes/field data already joined with user-defined polygons, or2) with data tables that can be joined with user-defined polygons, or3) with point data that can be aggregated to user-defined polygons within the app.Once you have information on each polygon
representing the number of items you wish to analyze that happen to be
contained in that area, you can use that information to combine small areas
into larger areas while maintaining a balance.For example, neighborhood polygons can be enriched with data
indicating the number of different types of crimes in each area. From this
data, you can create patrol zones where each zone has an equal number of
crimes. Census data polygons with the latest census data can be used for legislative redistricting.School attendance boundaries can be modified based upon number of students.Sales territories can be developed balancing customer sales using customer point data to user-defined polygons.EquiZone FeaturesUse your own data!  Any polygon and point or
tabular data will work.As you create new zones, EquiZone will assign a
new name and color to display on the map.Add or remove zones as necessary.Configure a tabular view of each zone with any,
or all of the attributes that you need.View attribute information in either raw numbers
or as a percentage of the total. When you add areas to zones, the table will
automatically update to show you how the attributes are currently balanced
between zones.Licensing:EquiZone is designed to be simple and affordable.  Purchasing an initial license from the Marketplace provisions the app to the organization for download.  An initial license file unlocking the ArcGIS Pro add-in for one computer will be promptly provided.

APO aggregates and optimizes multiple machine learning models to deliver substantial cost savings for water main replacement and emergency repairs with a 5X+ improvement in break reduction over traditional models. Results are delivered in a fraction of the time and cost of these traditional methods.APO delivers results in an intuitive, ArcGIS Online web application allowing you to interact with, query and connect to your existing ESRI environment. To get started, we simply need your water main GIS layer, water main break records and system hydraulic information (if available) to deliver results within a few weeks. The results provide a future break prediction on a pipe-by-pipe basis. Understanding that replacement planning often groups pipes into projects, APO also provides a clustering feature that uses multi-objective optimization to help planners build projects more effectively. New APO CapabilitiesXylem’s APO solution now analyzes data and scenarios beyond drinking water mains and incorporates water valves in the analytics. The solution provides a quantified criticality for valves, prioritized inspection, repair or replacement plan for valves and level of service impact due to inoperable valves.Xylem has also developed a machine learning based predictive model as part of APO that identifies service lines with higher probability of having lead.

Built on Esri's ArcGIS technology, Video GeoTagger lets user reference their GIS data when editing by loading shapefiles, raster imagery and other Esri-compatible streaming data. Of course Video GeoEditor also includes all the great video geo-tagging features of Video GeoTagger PRO & FREE editions, and much more!Video GeoEditor FeaturesPatented Easy Map-based Video Editing - No video editing experience needed, simply click on the GPS track of a geotagged video segment to make edit selections based on map locations and GIS data sets.Edit Video & Keep GPS Data Synchronized - All edited videos file keep the continuous GPS data intact and synchronized with the new video’s new time, allowing you to concentrate on editing the video intuitively without worrying about losing geospatial data.Extract Subclips From Video - Mark a begin-time and end-time within the video, then use the Extract Subclip function to save that selected segment as a new video file.Delete Video Sections & Merge - With Delete Selection & Merge, you can cut out unimportant selections from within a video to shorten it and reduce the file size, and keeping one video file.Delete Video Sections & Split - Similar to above, Delete Selection & Split, lets users cut out unneeded selections from within a video, but instead creates 2 new video files without the content from the deleted section.Trim From Start - The Trim From Start function deletes the section of video from the click point to the START of the video file.Trim To End - The Trim To End function deletes the section of video from the click point to the END of the video file.Split Video - The Split function cuts the video in to 2 new video files based on the click point.Join Geo-referenced Video File Segments - Join two geo-tagged, chronological video segments together, such as multiple video files with synchronized GPS companion files recorded in segments over a linear corridor or right-of-way (ROW).Overlay GPS Data on Video - Create video files with continuous GPS coordinates overlaid on top – useful for sharing video GPS information with others using traditional, non-geospatial video player software.Overlay Logos or Images on Video - Create video files with a logo or image overlaid on top, useful for branding or “watermarking” your videos.Transcode/Encode Video - Simple video transcoding feature to convert videos from one file format to another.Multiplex Synchronized Videos - Combine 2, 3 or 4 videos recorded over the same time and place into a singe video file with side by side or quad presentation. Ideal for combining multi-sensor gimbal videos like infrared and HD.Capture Individual Geotagged Still Images from Video - Take a screen capture of the current video frame, and it will automatically be geo-tagged with GPS data from the source video.Automated Image Extraction from Video - Capture a user-defined frequency of multiple geotagged still images from a video file including setting extraction start and end times. This is ideal for optimizing still images for 3rd-party photogrammetry and processing software like Pix4D and Esri Drone2Map.Also Includes ALL Video GeoTagger PRO & FREE edition FeaturesAutomatically Geotag Video – Video GeoEditor lets you easily combine any GPS log and video to automatically synchronize the video file with a GPS track with just a few clicks on the map.Manually Geotag Video – No GPS log file? No Problem! Just select as many points along the map as you want for points of interest you want to geotag in the video. Video Geotagger does the rest and will create geotagged video files! You can even geotag digitized historical video for documentaries and other location-based projects.Click-on-Map Video Playback – Video GeoEditor is also an interactive way to load and playback already geotagged video files with supported, synchronized GPS log files on a map.GPS Data Displays – Once video is properly geotagged, Video GeoEditor offers options for reviewing GPS and other data elements such as lat/lon, altitude, heading, speed and UTC time for any point during the video recording.DJI Drone Flight Log Geotagging – If your DJI drone model does not create synchronized .SRT GPS data files, Video GeoEditor allows users to geotag DJI drone videos using the encrypted Flight Record Logs .TXT files.Virtual Dashboard Gauges – An Optional panel appears below the map with virtual navigation instruments and gauges which displays information pulled from the GPS companion file, including:  heading, speed (in MPH and KPH), UTC date and time and altitude.LineVision Compatible Video – Video and GPS files created from Video GeoTagger FREE Edition are ready for import into Remote GeoSystems professional LineVision suite of software.Commercial & Government Use – Video GeoEditor offers unrestricted use for commercial, government and other for-profit projects.Un-encrypted Geospatial Video Files – Need to use your geotagged video files in non-Remote GeoSystems, 3rd party software? Video GeoEditor allows you to save your newly-geotagged video in an unencrypted format(s).Play GoPro Video with Embedded GPS – Video GeoEditor offers support for direct loading and playback of GoPro video with embedded GPS like the Hero 5, 6, 7 and 8 models, without having to first geotag using a GPS track log.DJI Drone Closed Captioning SRT Support – Video GeoEditor allows for simple mapping and playback of DJI videos that have GPS data in the closed captioning of the video.DJI Drone “Camera-Target-Footprint” Support – Post-flight, geotag DJI drone videos using the encrypted Flight Record Logs .TXT files to get at additional metadata parameters so that you can show where the camera is looking with a dynamic, 4-corner “footprint” and camera frame center of the video moving on the map. This creates a MISB FMV-like (full motion video) playback experience when proper MISB-spec metadata is not embedded in the video such as with most DJI drone models.Play MISB FMV/STANAG-spec Videos – Video GeoEditor offers support for direct loading and instant playback of MISB Full Motion Video/STANAG-spec video files with embedded metadata.YouTube Upload Privacy Settings & Custom Tags – Privacy settings for videos loaded to YouTube can be set for Private, Unlisted or Public. With Video GeoEditor you can also add custom tags to your YouTube videos.Advanced GIS Map Layer Control – Video GeoEditor edition comes with the same Layer Control panel found in LineVision Dekstop, offering capabilities to add map data layers to your video geotagging project. Even if you are not a traditional GIS or Esri user, you can utilize your own background maps with shapefiles, imagery and streaming endpoints and map server data produced by GIS specialists in your organization.Esri ArcGIS Online Authentication – Advanced GIS map layer control also includes support for authenticating users against your ArcGIS Online Enterprise account for data access.","Remote GeoSystems, Inc.","Business needsContact provider for more informationIndustriesPublic SafetyTelecommunicationsTransportationPetroleum and PipelineWorks withContact provider for more informationPlatformContact provider for more informationSystem RequirementsRecommendedOS: Windows 10 (64 bit)Processor: Intel Core i7 (8th Generation or better)Ports: (2) USB 3.0RAM: 16 GB MinimumHard Drive: 1 TB Minimum (or more depending on video size)Video Card: Minimum 4 GB memoryMinimumOS: Windows 10 (64 bit)Processor: Intel Core i7 or better (7th Generation or better)Ports: (2) USB 3.0RAM: 8GB Minimum, (Windows 10, 64 Bit or better)Hard Drive: 500 GB Minimum (or more depending on video size)Video Card: Minimum 1 GB memoryVersion29.9Listed DateMarch 3rd, 2020Contact InformationRemote GeoSystems, Inc.https://www.remotegeo.com/Email+1 844-436-3877",https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis-marketplace/listing/products/e4312779407542848695e84056e0436d

Tech TruPulse® laser rangefinders in-conjunction with an Eos Arrow Series™ GNSS receiver can be used as
a mobile laser-mapping solution enabling field crews to easily, quickly, and
safely capture an asset’s location remotely (i.e.
Offsets).  Who
Needs This SolutionThis
laser offset mapping solution is for field
crews that need to map hard-to-occupy assets without occupying every single
point.  This solution is common and ideal when assets are located on busy
highways, streets, alleyways, under building eves, swamplands/vegetation,
downtown areas, and in other hard-to-reach, unsafe, or GNSS-impaired
environments.What is an OffsetAn
offset is the combination of a distance and direction. Combining a recorded GPS
position with the associated distance and direction to your object ensures
high-accuracy positioning data.LaserGIS applies offsets to features by recording both a GNSS position
and associated distance and direction to the object of interest. This workflow
option allows the user to stay at one location and record the offsets and
attributes of all features within sight before moving to the next location.Required Components:-ArcGIS Collector or

confidence effort across the United States. The goal is to get enough 
people vaccinated to reach sufficient population immunity levels for 
communities across the country to safely get back to pre-pandemic 
activities and ways of life. Achieving this goal requires compelling 
communication assets that cities, counties, and leaders can use to 
encourage vaccination. By comparing future scenarios of disease spread 
at different levels of immunity for the same area, officials can create 
targeted data visualizations to drive vaccine uptake in particular 
communities.Epistemix Inc. can provide three scenarios showing future COVID-19 infections over time for any location within the United States. This is provided as three feature layers with 30%, 50%, and 70% of the population 
immune to the disease due either to vaccination or prior infection. The 
number of infections evolve over an 18-week period to illustrate how the
 disease spreads at different levels of immunity and demonstrates the 
importance of vaccinations.Generated by our leading COVID-19 model,
 this data provides the scientific basis for powerful, 
community-specific visualizations and communications assets that health 
officials can use to drive vaccine uptake. For example, in this video, we contrast the spread of COVID-19 in the Washington, D.C area when the population is 50% vs. 70% immune.Is

1m.  Perfect for pre-planning and simple
low-cost context visualisation purposes.   This data uses building
footprints extracted from the Ordnance Survey OpenMap product, we have added
complex landmark models to create a fantastic 3D building basemap.Using the OS OpenMap building
footprints provides a horizontal accuracy of approximately 1m though the
product has a claimed use scale of between 1:3,000 to 1:20,000. We height the
footprints using the UK Environment Agency LiDAR data. In general, the 1m LiDAR
or better has been used where possible, for all vertical data used the vertical
accuracy is better than ±15cm (0.15m).Unlike other similar data products,
this data product uses the maximum height for a building derived from the
LiDAR, as after much deliberation and comparison with real world data, it was
found that the maximum derived height was a more accurate representation, mean
height more often than not would provide only the height to the base of the
roof (potentially due to the start of slope to the top).Where possible, landmarks are
replaced by complex open source 3D models created in Sketchup or similar.You can view a demo of our data for

clients are using Portal for ArcGIS or ArcGIS Online to manage geospatial
content, applications, dashboards, and data sharing platforms across different
stakeholders. Administrating the ArcGIS environment involves migrating configuration
changes from one environment to another environment, such as Development to
Staging or Staging to Production, which requires a lot of time when performed
manually. iSpatialTec developed
a web-based application interface for performing critical administrative tasks
such as Cloning and Administrating your organization’s Portal for ArcGIS or
ArcGIS Online. The application provides a set of simplified tools and functionalities
for administering and managing content streamlining your day-to-day
administrative tasks. DashboardGroups

Cloning / Content Migration viz.,ArcGIS Portal to ArcGIS PortalArcGIS Portal to ArcGIS OnlineArcGIS Online to ArcGIS OnlineArcGIS Online to ArcGIS Portal This solution
provides easy access to Items, Users, and Groups throughout an Organization via
advanced filtering and sorting. There is also the capability to add
tags to users, as well as items and groups, for important classification
on-the-fly as situations develop. The ability to email users in bulk ensures that
everyone in the organization can be contacted with important information and
updates as needed. For very fluid environments and responses, users can be
invited rapidly to groups and items can be shared to the groups in bulk. Admin
Tools also support bulk updates to user roles, as well as their Esri access. In
situations where responsibilities and tasks may frequently shift from one user
to another, item ownership can be updated and changed quickly. To protect an organization’s
items, delete protection can be turned on in bulk across all items.Functions:1. In this interface, the Admin can create new Users, Items, Groups,
and Folders. Whatever changes are performed here will be reflected in the
ArcGIS online server.2. A Portal can have
users who are unaffiliated with an organization or users who are part of an
organization. A Portal contains Users, Groups, and Content.
Users sign into the Portal and create and share content. The system supports various
types of items, including the following:Maps—Web maps that can be displayed on all supported platforms (web, mobile, desktop)Layers—Feature, map, and image services that can be added as layers in web mapsApplications—Web and mobile applications whose content is provided by web mapsTools—Geocoding, routing, and other task-based services that can be used by applicationsData files—Files that can be uploaded, stored, and downloaded and, in certain cases, activated to create services (map layers)3. Users can keep content private
to themselves, share it with other users via Groups, or make it public and
accessible to everyone.4. Users can create and join groups,
in which users can share items. This makes the items visible to and accessible
by all other members of the Group.Modules: Dashboard:
Displays a collection of tools and the summary on log in. This gives a
quick overview of users, groups, item etc.Groups and User Management: Groups,
Users and folders can be managed here. It allows to Create, Delete, View, Edit
or export the list external file (CSV/JSON). Also, the tool allows to import
the list from CSV/JSON file.Items can be shared with the selected
groups as shown in snapshot as part of portal administering.Folder
Management: Facilitate to view, create, edit or delete folders. List of folders
can be exported to external files and imported as well. Saves time in modifying
folders in a batch mode at once.Portal
Cloning: The
set of tools under this category helps to export all or only selected items
from one Portal to another. All items or
only the selected items can be created in the target Portal as they were in the

Field Maps app, NextGen Cruiser is a platform built on ArcGIS that streamlines
the process of designing and executing timber cruises. With workflows that
extend from back-office cruise design to offline available data collection in
the field, it is a powerful tool that not only allows for cruise-designing and
offline mobile data collection, but additionally validates cruises, calculates,
and reports results.  From the
desktop interface, users can add custom reference layers to aid in cruise design,
choose from different basemaps, and import or draw polygons to design cruises. Once
the areas of choice are defined, our application will automatically create a
well-distributed grid of plots to ensure accurate sample collection. Field
workers use ArcGIS Field Maps to gather data from those plots. Through
symbolized buffer zones, workers can easily tell when they are within the
required distance of each plot, even when offline. When the cruise is complete,
data from ArcGIS Field Maps syncs with the back office where it is validated.
Analysts can then generate volume reports to facilitate crucial decisions.NextGen

pipeline integrity management software suite that helps operators manage risk,
ensure compliance, and optimize performance. The Liquids HCA Tool is designed
to meet all the requirements for “could affect” segment determination for
hazardous liquids pipelines, as specified in 49
CFR §195.452   Pipeline integrity management in high consequence
areas. The Liquids HCA Tool performs hydrocarbon plume transport
simulations that support the following product transport mechanisms:Overland
     flow – simulation of the hydrocarbon release plume over the surface of the
     earth, taking topography into accountHydrographic
     transport – simulation of the downstream transport of a hydrocarbon
     release plume that has entered a stream/river networkTo facilitate overland flow release plume simulations, The
Liquids HCA Tool uses a customized version of an open source Computational
Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling package called GeoClaw to
perform overland flow plume simulations. GeoClaw uses high-resolution, Godunov-type,
shock-capturing finite volume methods and Riemann solvers to
solve the shallow water
equations, a simplified, depth-integrated version of the general Navier-Stokes
equations for incompressible, viscous fluid flow. Of particular
importance to modeling pipeline releases and storage tank ruptures, dry states
in the model space are handled automatically by GeoClaw. Unlike many CFD tools,
the use of shock-capturing methods allows dry portions of the model space to be
handled implicitly and accurately. GeoClaw also incorporates Adaptive Mesh
Refinement (AMR) to facilitate efficient and stable simulation of the highly
transient flows typical of pipeline releases and storage tank ruptures.G2-IS has modified the GeoClaw kernel to allow for the
incorporation of fluid density and viscosity terms. Unlike many other
offerings, this enhancement enables GeoClaw to be legitimately used in modeling
fluids other than water, e.g., hydrocarbons. This refined simulation capability
is extremely important when the working fluid is a hydrocarbon product whose
density differs from water, and whose viscosity may differ from water by
multiple orders of magnitude.The use of GeoClaw in the overland transport modeling
portion of the Liquids HCA Tool enables the effective use of the
high-resolution digital elevation data now available via the USGS 3D Elevation
Program (3DEP) and the Esri Living Atlas. In
many parts of the United States, 3DEP data is now available at 1-meter
horizontal resolution. To allow the Liquids HCA Tool to take advantage of the
ever increasing resolution of elevation data, G2-IS has enabled the GeoClaw
engine to be run in the Microsoft Azure® virtualized
computing environment. This enables nearly unlimited performance scalability in
the Liquids HCA Tool, either on premises or in the cloud, a facilitates processing
performance that far outstrips tools limited to desktop computing.The hydrographic transport module of the Liquids HCA Tool
utilizes the latest version of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), NHDPlus
High Resolution (NHDPlus HR). Stream flow rate data is
incorporated directly into the NHDPlus HR dataset, facilitating more accurate
assessment of stream flow velocity, which is critical to determining the extent
of the downstream transport of the release plume. The hydrographic transport
engine of the Liquids HCA Tool makes use of Esri Network
Analyst extension technology in performing downstream trace
calculations.The combination of Liquids HCA Tool simulation algorithms
together with the extreme resolution of the USGS 3DEP and NHDPlusHR datasets
facilitates more accurate and detailed release plume modeling than ever before
possible. The output of both the overland flow and hydrographic transport
modules of the Liquids HCA Tool is fully time aware. This facilitates the
user’s ability to visualize the evolution of both overland and hydrographic
transport plumes through time, using the ArcGIS Pro time
slider. This capability enables Liquids HCA Tool output to be used as
an aid in emergency response plans and exercises.",G2 Integrated Solutions,"Business needsAsset Tracking and AnalysisFacility ManagementRisk ManagementSituational AwarenessIndustriesPetroleum and PipelineWorks withArcGIS ProPlatformDesktopSystem RequirementsArcGIS Pro  versions 2.8 and up.Version2.8.1Listed DateNovember 13th, 2020Contact InformationG2 Integrated Solutionshttps://knowledgecenter.g2-is.comEmail713-260-4000",https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis-marketplace/listing/products/4efe9bb05d164ea497ddc4689a5f158f

assessment of an asset’s integrity is the availability of consistent and fully
aligned datasets. Additionally, many regulators now require that all pipeline
records be traceable, verifiable and complete.However, with exponential increases in field-collected
pipeline data, the establishment of a system of record, where all available
data is readily accessible, is becoming an increasingly complex achievement for
pipeline operators.NIMA DM (Data Management) provides functionality
for uploading and aligning inspection data along the pipeline route by extending the capabilities of ArcGIS Pipeline
Referencing extension for ArcGIS Pro.NIMA DM’s integration into ArcGIS Pipeline
Referencing provides operators with intuitive, auditable, and repeatable steps for
ILI and survey alignment and subsequent data uploads to an operators system of
record. NIMA writes data results directly to a UPDM modelled geodatabase,
ensuring the right data is loaded to the right tables. NIMA DM maintains and
promotes temporality and will help operators achieve consistency in their
integrity management program’s data management efforts.General overview of NIMA DM
ArchitectureNIMA DM is provided to the user as an Add-in for
ArcGIS Pipeline Referencing. In the ArcGIS Pro ribbon, the user will see two
tabs, ETL and Alignment, grouped under ROSEN | NIMA DM.NIMA DM contains panes and views that allow the user to perform
necessary activities of ETL (extract, transform, and load) and alignment
workflows. The content of the NIMA DM view, for instance, is updated based on
the selected/active step in the Process Steps pane.Available panes and views in
AlignmentThe purpose of the alignment is to bring ILI and survey data into a
common linear reference system (defined by a route).In Alignment, the following panes and views are available.Visualization Control paneTabular Alignment viewVisual Alignment viewMap viewQuality Analysis pane BenefitsNIMA DM assists in keeping pipeline records
traceable, verifiable and complete by providing a structured workflow, which guides
users through the alignment and integration of large and complex inline
inspection and survey data, from different vendors or formats.NIMA DM’s most compelling benefits are:True synchronization between GIS-managed Pipeline
Assets and Inspection and Survey Data: NIMA DM provides a
more efficient and auditable process to align inspection data, ensuring new
survey data aligns with changes in your asset baseline over time (e.g.: re-routes,
cut-outs, or other asset location updates).Compliance with standards and regulations: NIMA DM enables you
to prove your records are traceable, verifiable and complete during system
audits. It provides a comprehensive data log, including versioning, timestamp
and user identity – including information that is added during inline
inspection or survey data loads. Efficient data handling: NIMA DM supports fast
integration and processing of huge amounts of data. Our experts constantly work
on improving the NIMA framework and
processes to handle the ever increasing data streams hitting operators today
and in the future. The NIMA FrameworkTogether with NIMA IM (Integrity Management), NIMA DM is part of a more
holistic pipeline data and integrity management framework. While NIMA DM offers
an intuitive and reliable way for the template-based upload, transformation and
alignment of pipeline inspection and survey data, NIMA IM is a platform that
allows for the autonomous definition and modification of integrity management
processes and integrated algorithms as needed. Not restricted to a set of
predefined functionalities, it offers unlimited options in terms of adaptation
to individual requirements as new process templates can be created and existing
ones altered at any point in time.",ROSEN - Development & Marketing License Portal,"Business needsAsset Tracking and AnalysisFacility ManagementField Service ManagementPerformance MonitoringRisk ManagementIndustriesPetroleum and PipelineElectric and Gas UtilitiesTransportationWaterNatural ResourcesWorks withArcGIS ProPlatformDesktopOn-premisesSystem RequirementsClient machine (Terminal server):ArcGIS Pro 2.4.0 Standard or Advanced and Location Referencing extension,ROSEN NIMA Alignment, ROSEN NIMA ETL,Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server,WindowsETL Server:FME Server 2019.2.3.2 Build 19825 - win64,ArcGIS Server 10.7.1,PyCrypto module for Python > 3.9.0,Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server,Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Native Client 11,ArcGIS Web Adaptor 10.7.1,IIS 7.5 or higher,Windows ServerDatabase Server:MS SQL ServerVersion2.1.Listed DateJanuary 12th, 2021Contact InformationROSEN - Development & Marketing License Portalnima.rosen-group.comEmail",https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis-marketplace/listing/products/1924b858213e47919a1696b335748242

The PENS events are updated every 5 minutes providing a near real-time state of the power distribution grid, making it an ideal layer to include in applications involving situational awareness, public safety and emergency response. The PENS power outage events are categorized by Magnitude, Intensity and Duration. This free trial layer summarizes PENS power outage events that are categorized with a Magnitude of at least ""small"" and displayed in the USNG 1 km x 1km grid. Note, the paid subscription of PENS includes micro events for even higher outage resolution. A power event is defined as a correlation in state, time, and geographic proximity. Since an event may span multiple 1 km USNG cells, the Event ID field is the primary identifier for a given event. The impact of an event is expressed in terms of geographic coverage as well as potential population impact. The Event Magnitude field defines the number of sensors associated with an event. Potential population impact is based on 2019 LandScan population estimates, with values for both day and night population. The population impact numbers are binned into categorical values as expressed in the Day Intensity and Night Intensity fields. The Start Time field expresses when the event started in the given USNG 1 km cell.Layers included in PENS Free Trial:Outages displays real-time power events at the USNG level.Far Zoom highlights current events at any zoom scale, pointing the user to the locations of events.USNG Coverage provides the USNG 1km x 1km grid cells representing the coverage footprint for the ~300,000 power sensors. The cells are categorized by their density of sensors, ranging from 1 to 20+ per cell. County Coverage provides county shapes with associated values representing the estimated population within a 1 km radius of Gridmetrics sensors, and the percentage of the county population which is covered.The PENS data layer is intended to be integrated into existing dashboards and decision support tools to enhance the visibility into the state of power with hyper local, real-time insights. PENS is best visualized in combination with the Human Geography Basemap, or other nondescript base maps such as Light or Dark Gray CanvasNOTE: PENS is built on a proprietary network of nearly 300,000 sensors deep in the power distribution grid. PENS provides an independent, observational view of the state of power beyond the substation. PENS compliments existing power outage information.

tree density over a specific period of time. These analytics can be used to
estimate the amount of tree loss in a planned development and to set
authorities for improvement of goals for an individual property.The Tree Canopy Assessment protocols were
developed by the USDA Forest Service to help communities develop a better
understanding of their green infrastructure through tree canopymapping and data analytics. Using
available datasets, planners can assess:Canopy cover for a
specified geographic area (City, Neighborhood, Parcel or Selection)Calculate estimated carbon sequestration using Canopy cover and display on mapAnalyze to locate and display potential Canopy Growth areasThe Tree Canopy analysis provides the following value

advantages:Users can run multiple analyses over the same
area with different inputs to perform a “what if” analysis and compare the
results side by side.The calculator’s user interface integrates with
ArcGIS Pro to provide a clear and comfortable user experience.There is the ability to use ArcGIS Pro’s
filtering and selection tools to control which lines or segments of the system
you want to analyze.Users can drill down to see the root cause of
why there is a HCA/MCA designation.  The Gas HCA/MCA Calculator for ArcGIS Pro creates several
intermediate output layers in your geodatabase, allowing you to follow the
calculation of an HCA or MCA all the way from structures and roads, through
overlapping sub-ranges to the final determination.  Each layer is linked to other layers, so you
can use ArcGIS Pro’s built-in data navigation tools to follow the relationships
from end to end.Gas HCA/MCA Calculator for ArcGIS Pro Benefits:The calculator is database-agnostic, working
through ArcGIS Pro against any supported map layer data source, from local file
geodatabases to enterprise geodatabases, or even feature services. It can save output data to a variety of map layer
data sources giving the user more options and flexibility.It is easy to use with a low learning curve.Built-in validation tools to allow you to validate
your results quickly and easily.The calculations are defendable and improve
overall TVC.Users have confidence that they are meeting
federal requirements.Visualizing risk helps to prioritize work.A picture is worth a thousand wordsThere are a variety of ways within this tool that the user
can visually see why the data is producing a HCA or MCA. For example, the
structure impact feature allows for graphical validation for controversial
areas. It allows a quick and easy way to visualize the data and validate it.
Users can even use gradients to visualize hotspots and vary the symbology by
attribute. For more information please contact us for a demo

The land cover data were at a 30 meter resolution from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). The explanatory variables[1] underlying the prediction modeling include:        Elevation        Slope        Proximity to primary roads        Proximity to secondary roads        Proximity to local roads        Proximity to high intensity development        Proximity to open water        Proximity to cropland (used only for transitions to cropland)        Protected areas        County subdivisions or counties/incorporated places (depending on the state)[2]The modeling procedure used is a newly developed algorithm suitable for distributed computing in a cloud computing environment[3]. Briefly, the procedure is based on kernel density estimation of the normalized likelihood of change associated with varying levels of each independent variable. These estimates are then aggregated by means of a locally-weighted average where the weights are based on the degree of conviction each variable has about the outcome at that specific pixel. Testing has shown it to be comparable in skill to a multi-layer perceptron neural network with the added advantages of rapid calculation and capability of being distributed across multiple computer nodes.Because the drivers of change can vary over space, modeling is done separately for each state. All transitions that meet an area threshold set by the user are used in the prediction modeling process. Within a single state, as many as 128 individual transitions might occur. In total, over the 48 conterminous states, 3330 transitions are possible.The modeling process initially establishes the potential to transition. This potential is expressed as a continuous value from 0 to 1 at each pixel for each transition. The procedure then uses the Markovian assumption that the rate of transition experienced in the historical period (2001-2011 in this case) will continue into the future. A competitive greedy selection process then allocates the projected change[4].To illustrate current day potential to change, a mean potential of transition image is created. With this potential image, users can click on locations to see the reasons why that location has the potential it does. It lists the individual transition potentials for all possible transitions for that specific pixel and allows the user to further determine how its values on the independent variables determined its specific potential.ValidationValidation and accuracy assessment of the modeling procedure in ALCM was conducted as follows. In the training process for each transition, 50% of historical instances of change and 50% of an equal-sized sample of pixels eligible to change, but which did not (e.g., persistence), were reserved for model validation. The median accuracy over all 3330 transitions is 80% with 79% of change validation pixels being correctly predicted and 83% of persistence pixels being correctly predicted. Thus the models, on average, are quite balanced in their ability to predict change and persistence.The accuracy associated with more specific transitions varied. A key objective was to be able to monitor and project anthropogenic changes and thus the explanatory variables chosen were focused on such drivers. Consequently, the median accuracy of natural to developed transitions (such as deciduous forest to low intensity development) was 92%. Again, accuracy was evenly balanced (93% for change / 91% for persistence).Accuracy for transitions between developed categories was lower at 77% (80% change and 75% persistence). A large part of this is because of the inconsistent manner in which roads are classified in the NLCD system. Roads are classified as one of the developed categories (high, medium, low and open development) based on the amount of impervious surface detected within pixels. Alignment of image pixels can cause this to vary resulting in roads that frequently switch classes between the years mapped.Natural transitions, such as forest to shrub, had the lowest overall accuracy at 74%. This was expected because many drivers cannot be predicted with the variables used. An example would be forest fires caused by lightning. This is also reflected in the fact that accuracy for predicting change was only 71% while that for predicting persistence was 78%.In states with significant cropland development, natural to cropland transitions were modeled with a 79% overall median accuracy. Accuracies for change and persistence were 78% and 81% respectively.Finally, this application used a protected lands layer from the USGS. This layer does not include all local or state designated protected lands. Thus, there may be areas that will show potential to change in protected areas. [1] Elevation data were from the National Elevation Database while slope was derived from those data. All roads data were acquired from the Census Bureau TIGER line files for 2014. Earlier road data would have been preferred, but errors in earlier TIGER line files were deemed to be unacceptable. Country subdivisions, counties and incorporated places were also acquired from the Census Bureau. Protected areas came from the Protected Areas Database of the USGS National Gap Analysis Program. All proximity layers were derived by Clark Labs.[2] In some states, planning jurisdiction is controlled by county subdivisions (such as in New England), while in others, planning is governed by a combination of counties and incorporated places (such as in many of the western states).[3] Eastman, J.R., Crema, S.C., and Rush, H.R., (forthcoming) A Weighted Normalized Likelihood Procedure for Empirical Land Change Modeling.[4] Greedy selection assumes that the specific pixels that will change are those that are ranked the highest. Conflicts are resolved by assigning them to the transition with the highest marginal transition potential.",Clark Labs,"Business needsContact provider for more informationIndustriesContact provider for more informationWorks withContact provider for more informationPlatformContact provider for more informationSystem RequirementsContact provider for more informationVersion1.0Listed DateApril 19th, 2018Contact InformationClark LabsEmail508-793-7526",https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis-marketplace/listing/products/06bb090b53614b11beca26c541380fb8

(CHA) provides this ArcGIS Pro add-in to calculate and validate Class Location
areas in United States and Canada in accordance with the regulatory and safety
requirements for successful gas pipeline operation. This Class calculator for
ArcGIS Pro is designed in accordance with U.S. CFR Title 49, Part 192, Subpart
A, Section §192.5 and for Canada, CSA Z662-19.The results are defendable and users can easily save the settings for
reuse, comparisons, and auditing purposes. Advanced Class Location analysis
logic, such as structure-by-structure validation or visual sliding class
assessment unit (eg. one mile), makes this a perfect tool for those needing to
run Class analysis on their assets.Capabilities include: Built-in advanced validation toolsFull integration with ArcGIS ProFully configurable settingsDefendable results saved for on-demand analysis
and audits Ability to calculate both US
Class and Canadian ClassOptional clustering for US assetsProvides a quick view of continuous sliding
assessment unitConfigurable data exportThis flexible tool can run a standard sliding
class calculation with or without clustering, utilizing attributes of
structures to drive each analysis. As results are generated, users can view
them as a map and export the data. The Structure Impact feature allows users to
easily identify the structures within a class assessment unit (eg. one mile)
within any point along the centerline. The user can define exactly what
data to include for each portion of the analysis. Only the features that
meet the criteria specified will be used and all other features will be
disregarded. The Class Calculator for ArcGIS Pro is designed to
streamline the workflow process wherever possible. Powerful analysis tools are
also provided to understand, verify, and interpret the analysis
results. Users can run multiple analyses over the same area, with different
inputs, to perform a “what if” analysis and compare the results side by side.Integration with Esri’s ArcGIS Pro brings several
advantages:Easily export the results in
standard Esri formats.A clear and comfortable user experience.Leverages ArcGIS Pro’s built-in filter and
selection tools.Class Calculator for ArcGIS Pro benefits:Built-in validation tools give Users the
confidence they are meeting federal requirements.The tool is database-agnostic, working through
ArcGIS Pro against any supported map layer data source, from local file
geodatabases to enterprise geodatabases, or even feature services. The calculations are consistent, repeatable, and
defendable, which may improve overall TVC efforts.For more information please contact us for a demo

The model assists with resource prioritization and allocation. The model accounts for factors such as total population, population density, population over 60, availability of ICU beds, stresses on the hospital and ICU system of each county, as well as confirmed cases of COVID-19, deaths, recovery rate and a litany of other factors. Each county is rated from 0–10 with 10 being the most at risk counties for their ability to manage the spread of the virus with existing resources.The risk score in all practicality means forecasts that cases that may need hospitalization will exceed available space unless the health care system is augmented.·       A risk factor of less than 1 is low, meaning that the available hospital system can sustain the potential influx of patients over the next seven days.·       A score of 1–2 is a medium risk, and the system may have more cases than available resources.·       Above 2 is high risk, and means we are forecasting that the system will not be able to absorb the influx of cases.Experience Geospark Analytics AI data in our interactive Story Map and learn more about the COVID model on YouTube.Data is available as a hosted Feature Service to easily integrate with all ESRI products in the ArcGIS ecosystem.For more information on Geospark Analytics Event models visit our product page.For use cases on how Geospark Analytics Event models can be used visit our blog.Contact us at sales@geospark.io for multiuser or enterprise pricing.",Geospark Analytics,"Business needsEconomic DevelopmentRisk ManagementLogistics and FulfillmentSituational AwarenessSupply Chain DigitizationIndustriesHealth and Human ServicesInsuranceState and Local GovernmentPublic SafetyNational GovernmentWorks withArcGIS AppsArcGIS EnterpriseArcGIS OnlineArcGIS ProPlatformDesktopOn-premisesMobileWebSystem RequirementsData is available as a hosted Feature Service to easily integrate with all ESRI products in the ArcGIS ecosystem.Versionv10Listed DateSeptember 4th, 2020Contact InformationGeospark Analyticshttps://geospark.ioEmail800-674-8398",https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis-marketplace/listing/products/c2f2de757e10412c85ca53640cd2e806

Custom data provisions will provide real-time state of the power distribution grid for specified geographic areas of interest, making it an ideal layer to include in applications involving situational awareness, public safety and emergency response. The PENS power outage events are categorized by Magnitude, Intensity and Duration. A power event is defined as a correlation in state, time, and geographic proximity. Since an event may span multiple 1 km USNG cells, the Event ID field is the primary identifier for a given event. The impact of an event is expressed in terms of geographic coverage as well as potential population impact. The Event Magnitude field defines the number of sensors associated with an event. Potential population impact is based on 2019 LandScan population estimates, with values for both day and night population. The population impact numbers are binned into categorical values as expressed in the Day Intensity and Night Intensity fields. The Start Time field expresses when the event started in the given USNG 1 km cell.Layers included in the Power Event Notification System:Outages displays real-time power events at the USNG level.Far Zoom highlights current events at any zoom scale, pointing the user to the locations of events.USNG Coverage provides the USNG 1km x 1km grid cells representing the coverage footprint for the ~300,000 power sensors. The cells are categorized by their density of sensors, ranging from 1 to 20+ per cell. County Coverage provides county shapes with associated values representing the estimated population within a 1 km radius of Gridmetrics sensors, and the percentage of the county population which is covered.The PENS data layer is intended to be integrated into existing dashboards and decision support tools to enhance the visibility into the state of power with hyper local, real-time insights. PENS is best visualized in combination with the Human Geography Basemap, or other nondescript base maps such as Light or Dark Gray CanvasNOTE: PENS is built on a proprietary network of nearly 300,000 sensors deep in the power distribution grid.

It is flexible with inputs, accepting any multispectral imagery and any in-situ point depth data to derive per-pixel depth measurements.Both the Multispectral Bathymetry Tool - Band Ratio & Multispectral Bathymetry Tool - Random Forest will accept spatially-referenced raster bands from any multispectral sensor. (Minimum 3-band (RGB), 4-band (RGBN), or above preferred). Common sensors include Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, WorldView-2 & 3, GeoEye-1, and SkySat. The Multispectral Bathymetry Tool - Ratio & Multispectral Bathymetry Tool - Random Forest will accept any level of processed imagery. However, when using the Multispectral Bathymetry Tool - Ratio, it is possible that atmospherically-corrected imagery may produce atypical results, particularly when an exponential regression is specified. Additionally, it is important to note that Input band rasters must have the same spatial reference, extent, cell size, and number of rows & columns. Contact sales@tcarta.com for any further assistance, feedback recommendations and questions.The Trident Tools geoprocessing toolbox is licensed by a TCarta authentication API, separate from Esri licensing. Multiple ArcGIS Online user logins can access the toolbox on a single machine.  Licenses are associated with a TCarta user account and an authentication key-code, and currently are tied to the specific machine on which it is installed. Migration of a license to another machine necessitates contacting TCarta support. License authentication keycode provided by TCarta via email after purchase.Tools included:1. In-situ Sample Tool The in-situ Sample Tool allocates a percentage of input data points to  use with the Multispectral Bathymetry Tools for algorithm calibration and validation with the QAQC Statistics Tool. It will randomly split your data up into two datasets: Calibration and Validation that will be used in the other tools. You can determine the percent of data that goes into each dataset2. Multispectral Bathymetry Tool - Band RatioTCarta’s Multispectral Bathymetry Tool- Ratio utilizes imagery and in-situ bathymetric point data to derive per-pixel depth measurements using a band-ratio algorithm. This tool will create your bathymetry surface and has the option to output statistics of your produced surface in the form of a points shapefile and a standalone table. 3. Multispectral Bathymetry Tool - Random ForestTCarta’s Multispectral Bathymetry Tool- RF utilizes imagery and in-situ bathymetric point data to derive per-pixel depth measurements using random-forest algorithm. This tool will create your bathymetry surface and has the option to output statistics of your produced surface in the form of a points shapefile and a standalone table. 4. QAQC Statistics ToolTCarta’s QAQC Statistics Tool utilizes in-situ bathymetric point data to evaluate the statistical accuracy of a produced or acquired bathymetric depth surface. This tool will create statistics based on the Validation points produced by the in-situ sample tool or other available in-situ data. It will output QAQC statistics as a point shapefile and QAQC_QAtable, and is the same process as the statistical outputs from the MBT Tools. 5. BAG CreatorThe BAG Creator tool enables users to compile their produced bathymetry surfaces into a fully compliant Bathymetric Attributed Grid (BAG) file format with a 2 band raster (elevation and uncertainty) and metadata.TestimonialsUsers of  Trident Tools have resolved data gaps with confidence, identified areas of environmental vulnerabilities, analyzed change over time, developed disaster response routes, and planned their echosounder surveys. Canada: Using multiple images and the Random Forest algorithm, 2m resolution SDB was produced from WorldView 2 and 3 and GEOeye-1 for Sidney Spit and Beaver Harbour, with SDB coverage totaling 5.71 and 42.25 km2 respectively. More than 4,500 independently derived ICESat-2 ground truth points ranging from +2.52 (above LAT) to 13.23m deep were used for calibration and validation.Belize: Using ICESat-2 Bathymetry depths as calibration data for 10m Satellite Derived Bathymetry, TCarta produced a surface in Belize from composited 10m Sentinel-2 imagery and the Random Forest algorithm to identify depths in shallow areas where gaps exist in nautical charts.Cape Cod: Over 2,0000 sq km of 2m resolution SDB produced from WorldView 2 and 3 imagery in the fall of 2020 using 55 images that TCarta tasked in the summer of 2020 to provide an up-to-date seafloor model in a highly dynamic area with strong currents, unconsolidated seafloor sediments and turbid waters.Recommended add-onICESat-2 Bathymetry https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis-marketplace/listing/products/ff024a8d5dec4c7e8edaf023ed8e1fce",TCarta Marine,"Business needsFacility ManagementRisk ManagementSite Analysis and Territory PlanningSituational AwarenessOperational EfficiencyIndustriesArchitecture, Engineering, and ConstructionPetroleum and PipelinePublic SafetyNational GovernmentState and Local GovernmentWorks withArcGIS ProPlatformDesktopSystem RequirementsRequired HardwareOS: Windows 7 64-bitCPU: Intel Core Duo 2.0GHz or AMD Athlon 64 X2 3600 (or comparable)RAM: 8GBRequired Software Windows 7 64-bit or aboveArcPro 2.4 or above.Version2.02Listed DateOctober 2nd, 2021Contact InformationTCarta Marinewww.tcarta.comEmail+1 303 284 6144",https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis-marketplace/listing/products/59c80204584d4d949cf55586b601e97b

lending, payday lending and insurance product; and for delivery by branch, ATM
card, online and mobile. access. Estimates of product propensity are produced based upon community populations
as defined by the current Esri demographics.  RPM's model relies on a variety of socio-economic measures, housing, and other variables as reflected in
consumer behavior from several different surveys commissioned by the Federal Reserve Bank. Raw survey data is utilized from’s Survey of Consumer Finances, the Survey of Mobile Banking, and the Survey of Household Economic Decision-Making, all of which are based on statistically representative, comprehensive sampling of U.S. households
based on in-home personal interviews conducted tri-annually. Critical Top 3% or
“Wealth” households are over-sampled, because of their under-representation in
a random sample.  This high quality
research, conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank and accompanied by a cover
letter signed by the Fed Chairman (Janet Yellen for the most recent Survey), is superior in validity and
reliability to “central location testing” telephone surveys conducted by

you manage all your environmental spatial data, while also conducting
condition assessments to those structures. You’ll have access to historical
inspection and maintenance records that are maintained throughout your
environmental feature inventory. Easy-to-understand dashboards and thematic
maps provide management oversight to your overall environmental feature
network. In many cases, the sheer amount of data to track for all environmental

allows dispatchers to manually assign tasks to workers. Workforce Planner
automates and optimizes this process. This way total drive time and travel
distance for the fleet will be drastically
minimized.Navigator
offers navigation from A to B and sequence optimization (TSP) of the locations already
assigned to a certain route. Workforce Planner re-assigns all (selected) tasks to workers (using a VRP optimization) in order to create the best overall schedule for the entire fleet
of workers.Workforce
Planner will respect individual time windows on the assignments.Using Workforce
Planner, you can create optimal routes, for the entire fleet, within minutes and
save time at the office. The optimized routes can save up to 30 % on both total
travel time and km/miles driven. You may even cut down on the number of
vehicles or workers needed.You can choose
either to use the ArcGIS Online VRP solver or the Rapidis VRP solver.With the ArcGIS
Online VRP solver you will spend credits from your ArcGIS online subscription.
This choice is recommended for organizations who will plan less frequently as
you spend ArcGIS online credits when you activate the planning.Using the
Rapidis Logistics Planner VRP solver you have unlimited access to activate
scheduling as often as you please without spending credits. Also the Rapidis
VRP offers additional parameter settings that will tweak the scheduling to meet
the requirements in different industries and scenarios. The Rapidis VRP follows a per asset license pricing model.

Users can geographically search the library using an ArcGIS based gazetteer and retrieve digital copies of the information stored for future reprinting or incorporation into other documents.MapLibrary includes a web-based administrator interface for customizing the metadata stored with the documents, constructing pre-defined searches, and configuring user profiles if maps or documents need to be approved prior to being made available for retrieval. MapLibrary allows GIS users to share their work with others in their organization, and can save hours that would otherwise be necessary to regenerate lost or hard-to-locate maps.Browser-Based ClientA web browser is the only software required on the client’s hardware to take advantage of the basic functionality of MapLibrary. This enables the users and administrators to access maps and other artifacts easily, with little to no burden on IT or GIS staff. Comprehensive online help is available for both users and administrators.Simple and Powerful Search ToolsSearchers can choose from two different search techniques to find maps. A simple single line search is familiar to users of popular web search engines, and a powerful metadata based search that is easily customized to the needs of your organization.Searchers can also search spatially by selecting an area on a map. This spatial search can be combined with other metadata criteria for a powerful search solution. The results of a search include metadata and map images, including thumbnail previews.Powerful Metadata EngineMapLibrary provides a very customizable metadata engine that allows different types of maps or documents to have different metadata associated with them. A simple web-based administration interface allows easy customization of this powerful metadata engine.Automated Loading of MapsMapLibrary includes an extension to ArcGIS that allows GIS specialists to directly post their maps into the library. The extension provides the GIS specialist with the option to archive a vast number of file formats including PDF, JPG, and Postscript over the Intranet to the central repository, and to author metadata about the map in MapLibrary. Much of the metadata is automatically created for the user. This option offers a timesaving alternative to publishing the maps via the browser interface since the maps are posted directly from the local GIS software. MapLibrary also provides a powerful tool for quickly loading large quantities of scanned images or other documents. This Bulk Loader can be used to import both the documents and a custom set of searchable metadata for each drawing.Approval Workflow Prior to General AvailabilityMapLibrary includes an optional setting whereby the administrator can enforce document approval on an individual user basis. Supervisors can approve a submission thereby making it generally available to searchers. Supervisors can also reject a submission, which sends it back to the archiver to be reworked. These features enable a workflow that ensures supervisor approval is secured before the document can be retrieved from the library.Pre-defined SearchesMapLibrary includes the capability to store frequently used search criteria as pre-defined searches. These pre-defined searches can be made available as links on the home page allowing users to quickly and efficiently view maps and other artifacts. For example, the administrator can create a pre-defined search to enable the users to see the latest version of maps or as-builts being generated for a high profile project.Includes MapLibrary installation, ArcGIS Pro Add-In, and Portal for ArcGIS Widget.",DCSE,"Business needsOperational EfficiencyIndustriesState and Local GovernmentWaterElectric and Gas UtilitiesTransportationWorks withArcGIS EnterpriseArcGIS ProPlatformDesktopOn-premisesWebSystem RequirementsWindows Server 2012R2, 2016, or 2019Microsoft SQL Server (64-bit) 2012R2, 2014, 2016, or 2019- Express, Standard, or EnterpriseVersion9Listed DateOctober 14th, 2021Contact InformationDCSEwww.dcse.comEmail949-465-3400",https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis-marketplace/listing/products/bd145dc6b7874cd18365fba25f0cec95

Reappraisal System (PRS) is a GIS-driven workflow management, data collection,
data review, quality control, and business analysis solution for Property
Appraisers. The goal of the system is to eliminate the need for paper by
creating a completely digital product, and leverage GIS functionality to
improve appraisal efficiency. Highlights include: Quality control of CAMA
dataControlled field visits due
to organized parcels and efficient route creation  Elimination of
unnecessary visits due to digital inspectionTracked revision history
and changes, for quality control purposesReal-time thematic maps and reports. The PRS is an ArcGIS
Online solution that utilizes Identity access, and communicates exclusively
with AGOL content,  including web maps
and web feature layers. This provides flexible and scalable deployment options,
as  data can be served from either ArcGIS
for Server or AGOL-hosted feature services.  The PRS makes use of the entire ArcGIS
Platform, thus supporting our goal of providing the highest level of accuracy
and efficiency to the appraisal process. The PRS is a suite of
six integrated, configurable ArcGIS for Local Government COTS applications
consisting of:1. Packet Builder – The Packet Builder is used to organize
parcels into ordered lists, called “packets,” for the purpose of field visits.
 The application provides a variety of tools for selecting candidate
parcels based on parcel attributes and spatial location.  The application
allows packets to be assigned to specific appraisers, which are then queued for
the Sketch Reviewer, Photo Reviewer, and Mobile Property Card applications. 2. Sketch Reviewer– The Sketch Reviewer provides
the ability to dynamically georeference building sketches from CAMA systems as
an overlay to parcel maps and orthophotography. This allows users to validate
the existence and size of structures, additions and improvements on a parcel,
and to flag and comment on parcels that fail validation.3. Photo Reviewer – The Photo Reviewer provides  a virtual visit to the property.  The
application allows the user to query a packet with synchronized access to:ArcGIS parcel web maps with orthophotographyOblique imageryGround level imageryProperty record card dataThe users can also flag the parcel as passing or failing validation. 4. Mobile Property Card – The Mobile
Property Card is for mobile app for
touch-screen tablets. It allows  users to
select a packet and check out all of the property data, including building
sketches and property photos. Once a packet is downloaded,  users may continue data editing, even without
an Internet connection.  All data that can be
found on a typical paper property record card is categorized in an intuitive
touch screen layout.  Categories include general parcel information,
values, land, dwelling, additions, improvements, cost ladders, transfer
history, and permits.  Additionally, the building sketch, property photos,
an interactive map, and reviewer comments from the Sketch Validation and Photo
Reviewer applications are provided.  The user may edit existing records,
as well as add and remove records. The Mobile Property Card app also supports
marking up attachments and taking photos with the tablet’s camera. Once a user has
completed the site visits for a route, they can choose to check in the route
parcels.  All parcels that have a “saved” or “approved” status are updated
in the production database.  Any changes will update the revision history
tables.  All approved records are queued for the quality control application. 5. Quality Control Reviewer - The
Quality Control Reviewer application provides a final review of all data before
it is entered back into CAMA. All parcels that have been checked in from
the Mobile Property Card application are listed in a queue. Users select
a parcel record, which opens the property card display.  If any edits were
made to any records in a category, the tab is highlighted.  The underlying
production database tracks full revision history. The application
supports a historical view whereby all changed records are color coded. Modified records also provide a clear comparison view of the current and
original values.  The purpose of the Quality Control application is to
accept or reject the submitted information before the actual CAMA system is
updated. 6. Executive Dashboard – This application
provides a real-time overview of project progress using thematic maps and
reports. The default thematic map displays each of the workflow tasks (described
above) in a unique color. Any parcels that have been flagged as having
failed an inspection or rejected by the QC Reviewer are given an additional
hatch pattern symbol. Simply viewing the map gives the user the immediate
sense of overall project progress. The application also supports further
filtering. Users can search and identify individual parcels and view all
system information about the parcel, including the names and time stamps of each
user in each workflow task. Any reviewer comments are also listed. This allows project managers and project sponsors to instantly
investigate the history and current status of any parcel. To request additional

We identify the features / characteristics of an “emerging area” and then rank the areas that are over-indexed for those characteristics.This feature service includes the full set of attributes listed below, providing insights at the tract-level for all 384 MSAs within the US, and aggregated on a monthly level for the most recent 12 months. This data is updated on a monthly basis with a ten-week lag in order to accurately capture moves.Please note that the data in this feature service is not exportable. If you would like this dataset available as a downloadable table, for a different time period, or geography, please get in touch with us here.What can Emerging Areas do for you?You gain an exclusive view into the arrival and departure of people in a specified geographical area. Emerging Areas also calculates the potential impact to an area's income levels, and helps identify patterns more rapidly than traditional datasets.Who benefits from the Emerging Areas dataset?Regardless of whether you’re a residential or commercial real estate investor, agent, underwriter, analyst, developer, construction company, leasing manager, or mortgage lender, you need actionable data to facilitate smarter, informed decisions that keep you a step ahead of the competition. Fields Includedobservation_start_date - Observation Start Dateobservation_end_date - Observation End Datearea_id - Tract IDcounty_name - Countystate_name - Statecbsa_id - MSA IDcbsa_name - MSA cbsa_type - MSA Typeinflow - Population Inflowoutflow - Population Outflowtotal_net_flow - Population Total Net Flowweekly_net_flow - Population Weekly Net Flowincome_inflow - Income Inflowarea_income_median - Area Median Incomeincome_diff - Income Differenceseasonal_classification_population - Seasonal classification for populationseasonal_classification_income - Seasonal classification for incomeyearly_classification_population - Yearly classification for populationyearly_classification_income - Yearly classification for incomeconfidence_interval_width - Confidence interval width of underlying movestotal_population - Total Populationuniversity_flag - University Flag (Indicates if university students in an area are estimated to comprise of 10% of more of the local population - these are areas that may see more volatile trends due to student movements)zone_type - Zone Type (Indicates if this area is a designated Opportunity Zone)Area ClassificationsSeasonal Classification: PopulationGrowing Population - The absolute difference in net flow (extrapolated to a full year) between the three most recent months and the same three months the previous year leads to a population growth of >5% (tract-level) or >2% (county-level). Declining Population - The absolute difference in net flow (extrapolated to a full year) between the three most recent months and the same three months the previous year leads to a population growth of <-5% (tract-level) or <-2% (county-level).Stable - An area that does not meet any of the other criteria.Seasonal Classification: IncomeGrowing Income - The average income of population inflows in the most recent three months is >20% (tract-level) or >10% (county-level) higher than the same period from the previous year, and this difference is established to be statistically significant.Stable - An area that does not meet any of the other criteria.Yearly Classification: PopulationGrowing Population - The average population growth rate over the last 12 months is >5% (tract-level) or >2% (county-level). Declining Population - The average population growth rate over the last 12 months is <-5% (tract-level) or <-2% (county-level).Stable - An area that does not meet any of the other criteria.Yearly Classification: IncomeGrowing Income - The average income of population inflows over the last 12 months is >20% (tract-level) or >10% (county-level) higher than the median income of the area itself, and this difference is established to be statistically significant.Stable - An area that does not meet any of the other criteria.ResourcesEmerging Areas Blog PostEmerging Areas Use CasesEmerging Areas Webinar",Unacast,"Business needsEconomic DevelopmentMarket and Customer AnalysisSite Analysis and Territory PlanningIndustriesReal EstateRetailHealth and Human ServicesWorks withArcGIS AppsArcGIS EnterpriseArcGIS OnlineArcGIS ProPlatformWebSystem RequirementsArcGIS OnlineVersionEmerging Areas v3 (2021-01-29)Listed DateJanuary 30th, 2021Contact InformationUnacasthttps://www.unacast.com/covid19/covid-19-migration-patterns-and-emerging-areasEmail",https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis-marketplace/listing/products/0172f2e75e2c4bd1883912f0b4a29821

incomplete or non-existent, and some programs may have taxonomic data gaps,

ALCE also includes a predictive mapping of land cover for the year 2050 as well as a mapping of the mean potential of land to go through one or more transitions by that date. Users can thus select whether to view:        Land cover 2001        Land cover 2011        Change in land cover from 2001 to 2011        Potential of land to transition by 2050        Predicted land cover for 2050        Predicted change in land cover from 2011 to 2050Note that all change and prediction images in ALCE were created using the American Land Change Modeler (ALCM). Users who subscribe to ALCM can define their own specific areas of interest and undertake unlimited analyses for those areas within the subscription period. ProcedureThe prediction for 2050 is based on an empirical modeling of the relationship between land cover change from 2001 to 2011 and a series of explanatory variables. The land cover data were at a 30 meter resolution from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). The explanatory variables[1] were:        Elevation        Slope        Proximity to primary roads        Proximity to secondary roads        Proximity to local roads        Proximity to high intensity development        Proximity to open water        Proximity to cropland (used only for transitions to cropland)        Protected areas        County subdivisions or counties/incorporated places (depending on the state)[2]The modeling procedure used is a newly developed algorithm suitable for distributed computing in a cloud computing environment[3]. Briefly, the procedure is based on kernel density estimation of the normalized likelihood of change associated with varying levels of each independent variable. These estimates are then aggregated by means of a locally-weighted average where the weights are based on the degree of conviction each variable has about the outcome at that specific pixel. Testing has shown it to be comparable in skill to a multi-layer perceptron neural network with the added advantages of rapid calculation and capability of being distributed across multiple computer nodes.Because the drivers of change can vary over space, modeling was done separately for each state. All transitions that met or exceed 2 km2 in area (at the state level) were modeled independently. Within a single state, as many as 128 individual transitions might occur. In total, over the 48 conterminous states, 3330 transitions were modeled.The modeling process initially establishes the potential to transition. This potential is expressed as a continuous value from 0 to 1 at each pixel for each transition. The procedure then uses the Markovian assumption that the rate of transition experienced in the historical period (2001-2011 in this case) will continue into the future. A competitive greedy selection process then allocates the projected change[4].To illustrate current day potential to change, a mean potential of transition image was created. With this potential image, users can click on locations to see the reasons why that location has the potential it does. It lists the individual transition potentials for all possible transitions for that specific pixel and allows the user to further determine how its values on the independent variables determined its specific potential.ValidationIn the training process for each transition, 50% of historical instances of change and 50% of an equal-sized sample of pixels eligible to change, but which did not (e.g., persistence), were reserved for model validation. The median accuracy over all 3330 transitions was 80% with 79% of change validation pixels being correctly predicted and 83% of persistence pixels being correctly predicted. Thus the models, on average, are quite balanced in their ability to predict change and persistence.The accuracy associated with more specific transitions varied. A key objective was to be able to monitor and project anthropogenic changes and thus the explanatory variables chosen were focused on such drivers. Consequently, the median accuracy of natural to developed transitions (such as deciduous forest to low intensity development) was 92%. Again, accuracy was evenly balanced (93% for change / 91% for persistence).Accuracy for transitions between developed categories was lower at 77% (80% change and 75% persistence). A large part of this is because of the inconsistent manner in which roads are classified in the NLCD system. Roads are classified as one of the developed categories (high, medium, low and open development) based on the amount of impervious surface detected within pixels. Alignment of image pixels can cause this to vary resulting in roads that frequently switch classes between the years mapped.Natural transitions, such as forest to shrub, had the lowest overall accuracy at 74%. This was expected because many drivers cannot be predicted with the variables used. An example would be forest fires caused by lightning. This is also reflected in the fact that accuracy for predicting change was only 71% while that for predicting persistence was 78%.In states with significant cropland development, natural to cropland transitions were modeled with a 79% overall median accuracy. Accuracies for change and persistence were 78% and 81% respectively.Finally, this application used a protected lands layer from the USGS. This layer does not include all local or state designated protected lands. Thus, there may be areas that will show potential to change in protected areas. [1] Elevation data were from the National Elevation Database while slope was derived from those data. All roads data were acquired from the Census Bureau TIGER line files for 2014. Earlier road data would have been preferred, but errors in earlier TIGER line files were deemed to be unacceptable. Country subdivisions, counties and incorporated places were also acquired from the Census Bureau. Protected areas came from the Protected Areas Database of the USGS National Gap Analysis Program. All proximity layers were derived by Clark Labs.[2] In some states, planning jurisdiction is controlled by county subdivisions (such as in New England), while in others, planning is governed by a combination of counties and incorporated places (such as in many of the western states).[3] Eastman, J.R., Crema, S.C., and Rush, H.R., (forthcoming) A Weighted Normalized Likelihood Procedure for Empirical Land Change Modeling.[4] Greedy selection assumes that the specific pixels that will change are those that are ranked the highest. Conflicts are resolved by assigning them to the transition with the highest marginal transition potential.",Clark Labs,"Business needsContact provider for more informationIndustriesEducationWorks withContact provider for more informationPlatformContact provider for more informationSystem RequirementsContact provider for more informationVersion1.0Listed DateMay 26th, 2017Contact InformationClark LabsEmail508-793-7526",https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis-marketplace/listing/products/1ae8efacf1594723b812534ad56af142

The goal is to get enough people vaccinated to reach sufficient population immunity levels for communities across the country to safely get back to pre-pandemic activities and ways of life. Achieving this goal requires compelling communication assets that cities, counties, and leaders can use to encourage vaccination. By comparing future scenarios of disease spread at different levels of immunity for the same area, officials can create targeted data visualizations to drive vaccine uptake in particular communities.This data from Epistemix Inc.  provides three scenarios of future COVID-19 infections over time for the Washington, D.C. area, with 30%, 50%, and 70% of the population immune to the disease due either to vaccination or prior infection. The number of infections evolve over an 18-week period to illustrate how the disease spreads at different levels of immunity and demonstrates the importance of vaccinations.Generated by our leading COVID-19 model, this data provides the scientific basis for powerful, community-specific visualizations and communications assets that health officials can use to drive vaccine uptake. For example, in this video, we contrast the spread of COVID-19 in the Washington, D.C area when the population is 50% vs. 70% immune.Is your team working to accelerate vaccine uptake in your community? This data is also available for other locations and vaccinations levels. If you are interested in another location or alternate scenarios, please send us a purchase request or contact Epistemix at sales@epistemix.com.

Please note that the full detection capabilities of this solution are derived from the detection capabilities of your locator brand and model. What accuracy will you get with underground mapping?Eos Locate™ is powered by the popular Eos Arrow Series of receivers. As such, the solution's accuracy comes from the Arrow GNSS receiver you are using.  (If you don't yet have an Arrow receiver, you can contact Eos Positioning Systems here.)  The Eos Arrow 200 and Arrow Gold receivers can provide centimeter-level accuracy, making them the ideal option for workflows requiring highly accurate elevations. What is the cost?Eos Locate™ is free to Esri customers who already own the required compatible hardware and software components. There is no additional activation fee or license to purchase. Our technical support team can help you get started once you have the required components. Watch a video case study of a municipality mapping a variety of mixed utility assets with Eos Locate and ArcGIS Collector:Click here to view the video case study with transcript.Can I try Eos Locate™ if I don't have the hardware? We are constantly releasing more digital content, such as how-to videos and articles, that demonstrate how to use Eos Locate™. In addition, you can request a demonstration of the solution by contacting Eos. This will put you in touch with a qualified, authorized local reseller of Arrow who is familiar with the solution. What is the value of deploying Eos Locate™? 1. Safety Improvements Prevent liabilities to your constituents, employees, and third parties by keeping accurate records of underground pipes, cables, and wires in ArcGIS Online. While your Arrow GNSS receiver and Esri mobile apps can be used to map new installations, Eos Locate™ allows you to capture the locations of assets that have been previously installed.2. Improve Efficiency of Field OperationsInstead of sending two crews to the field — one to locate underground assets and one to conduct the mapping workflow — send one crew. This saves time and money. A single field worker can both locate the underground assets and submit their locations to ArcGIS Online in the push of a button.3. Prepare for the future of work with Augmented Reality and 3D workflowsAugmented Reality (AR) technology is very eye-catching — but it cannot work if the X, Y, and Z data in your GIS is inaccurate or missing. To pave the way for the future of work, you must collect what's under the pavement.  Eos Tools Pro, the free app that powers the Eos Locate™ solution, can output real-time orthometric heights (elevations) of the buried assets to Collector. This provides the critical, high-confidence accuracy you will need to deploy downstream workflows with highly accurate Z values. It's also important to note that the Eos Locate™ solution includes the submission of depth of cover (along with other standard locator data) to Collector. Summary of Eos Locate™ benefits:Map buried assets with submeter or centimeter accuracy in ArcGIS Online. Single-user setup allows for simultaneous locate and GPS-mapping workflows.Exclusively compatible with Esri Apps (Field Maps/Collector), Arrow GNSS receivers, and leading utility locator devices.Simple solution design takes advantage of the intuitive iOS platform.Required Technology:Arrow Series® GNSS receiver (any model) from Eos Positioning SystemsEos Tools Pro (free iOS app; latest version) ArcGIS Collector® or ArcGIS Field Maps® (latest version)iOS device (iPad, iPhone)Compatible underground locator (for a list of compatible locators or to see if the locator brand you own is in the processes of becoming compatible with this solution, please contact Eos)For more information:For instructional videos, how-to articles, a 50-page manual about Eos Locate™ and more, please visit the Eos Locate™ webpage on the Eos website.

RFID?InfraMarker by Berntsen leverages RFID technology to create truly connected asset management. Physical
assets marked with RFID tags (above or below ground) are easy to locate and
verify. Each RFID tag identifies the specific asset with its name, owner,
latitude and longitude and a unique ID. Field workers read the RFID tag that
automatically identifies the asset and launches the associated inspection forms
from ArcGIS Online. Field verification of asset data improves data quality and streamlines
the inspection, maintenance and management of water infrastructure assets, and
helps reduce long-term operating costs.WHOM IS INFRAMARKER RFID
