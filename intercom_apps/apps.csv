Feedback by Userfeed helps teams capture, manage, and close the loop on product feedback where customer engagement happens: Intercom. Userfeed is the only feedback product built 100% on Intercom. With Userfeed, your feedback is private by default, meaning you and your team can push feedback from Intercom conversations, collaborate, sync with developer tools, all without exposing it to your customers (video). We then offer you multiple ways to share directly with users if you choose to do so (share your roadmap, collect feedback via a form in Messenger, or even create custom Saved Views to share publicly).Userfeed is basically a full blown Intercom tag manager (each Userfeed post has a unique Intercom tag), so you can even go beyond just feedback use cases. You can track all sorts of things (and keep them totally private to your team), like common questions, customer cancellation reasons, demo feedback, you name it.And since we're always in sync with Intercom users and conversations via tags, each post in Userfeed has a dedicated customer segment in Intercom. No other feedback tool enables this superpower. This makes it simple to message all users linked to a piece of feedback, directly within Intercom where all your user data and messages already live (video).Check out all our videos showing all the ways you can use Userfeed to set up your custom feedback process.""Because Userfeed is deeply integrated with Intercom, it’s super convenient to connect with the user using a channel that they’re already familiar with.

Feedback by Userfeed helps teams capture, manage, and close the loop on product feedback where customer engagement happens: Intercom. Userfeed is the only feedback product built 100% on Intercom. With Userfeed, your feedback is private by default, meaning you and your team can push feedback from Intercom conversations, collaborate, sync with developer tools, all without exposing it to your customers (video). We then offer you multiple ways to share directly with users if you choose to do so (share your roadmap, collect feedback via a form in Messenger, or even create custom Saved Views to share publicly).Userfeed is basically a full blown Intercom tag manager (each Userfeed post has a unique Intercom tag), so you can even go beyond just feedback use cases. You can track all sorts of things (and keep them totally private to your team), like common questions, customer cancellation reasons, demo feedback, you name it.And since we're always in sync with Intercom users and conversations via tags, each post in Userfeed has a dedicated customer segment in Intercom. No other feedback tool enables this superpower. This makes it simple to message all users linked to a piece of feedback, directly within Intercom where all your user data and messages already live (video).Check out all our videos showing all the ways you can use Userfeed to set up your custom feedback process.""Because Userfeed is deeply integrated with Intercom, it’s super convenient to connect with the user using a channel that they’re already familiar with.

Feedback by Userfeed helps teams capture, manage, and close the loop on product feedback where customer engagement happens: Intercom. Userfeed is the only feedback product built 100% on Intercom. With Userfeed, your feedback is private by default, meaning you and your team can push feedback from Intercom conversations, collaborate, sync with developer tools, all without exposing it to your customers (video). We then offer you multiple ways to share directly with users if you choose to do so (share your roadmap, collect feedback via a form in Messenger, or even create custom Saved Views to share publicly).Userfeed is basically a full blown Intercom tag manager (each Userfeed post has a unique Intercom tag), so you can even go beyond just feedback use cases. You can track all sorts of things (and keep them totally private to your team), like common questions, customer cancellation reasons, demo feedback, you name it.And since we're always in sync with Intercom users and conversations via tags, each post in Userfeed has a dedicated customer segment in Intercom. No other feedback tool enables this superpower. This makes it simple to message all users linked to a piece of feedback, directly within Intercom where all your user data and messages already live (video).Check out all our videos showing all the ways you can use Userfeed to set up your custom feedback process.""Because Userfeed is deeply integrated with Intercom, it’s super convenient to connect with the user using a channel that they’re already familiar with. Nothing is worse than messaging the user in a bunch of different channels and threads.
