Having several different calendars runs the risk of double-booking or missing appointments, leaving you looking unprofessional or losing important deals.
To prevent this, we suggest syncing your Pipedrive account to your Microsoft calendar to bring your worlds together using Pipedrive's Calendar Sync.Two-way sync
When two-way sync is selected, activities created in Pipedrive will be synced to the linked calendar. When events are created in that linked calendar, activities will also be created in Pipedrive. Edits made to either of these items will update the linked Pipedrive activity or calendar event.One-way sync
When one-way sync is selected, activities created in Pipedrive will be synced to the linked calendar. When events are created in that linked calendar, however, they will not create activities in Pipedrive. Any changes made in the linked calendar to events created by activities in Pipedrive will still update those activities in Pipedrive.Activity type customization
If you are using two-way sync, you can configure the activity type of the events syncing from your external calendar. You can also specify the activity types which you wish to sync to your external calendar from Pipedrive. By default, all activity types sync to the external calendar.Setup and installationClick on “Add account” on the calendar sync pageEnter the email address of the calendar account you wish to syncAuthenticate your Pipedrive account with the external calendarSet up your calendar sync settings (calendar, one-way, two-way, activity type)Wait for a few minutes for calendar sync to be set upYou can test how sync works by creating a test activity and watch it sync to your external calendar (and vice-versa) Notice regarding your calendar account data

However, having several calendars runs the risk of double-booking or missing appointments, leaving you looking unprofessional or losing important deals. To prevent this, we suggest syncing your Pipedrive account to your Google calendar to bring your worlds together using Pipedrive’s Calendar Sync.Two-way sync
When two-way sync is selected, activities created in Pipedrive will be synced to the linked calendar. When events are created in that linked calendar, activities will also be created in Pipedrive. Edits made to either of these items will update the linked Pipedrive activity or calendar event.One-way sync

When events are created in that linked calendar, however, they will not create activities in Pipedrive. Any changes made in the linked calendar to events created by activities in Pipedrive will still update those activities in Pipedrive.Activity type customization
If you are using two-way sync, you can configure the activity type of the events syncing from your external calendar. You can also specify the activity types which you wish to sync to your external calendar from Pipedrive.

There are just too many touchpoints and people involved in the buying decision, resulting in complex buyer journeys and long sales cycles. Transparency gets lost. Everyone knows that B2B revenue attribution is important, but where do you even start? The bigger the ad spend, the bigger the potential, but also the pain!To try and solve this, a lot of companies still rely on attribution systems that are stitched together in Excel from a mix of ill-maintained B2C tools, giving them a skewed view of their revenue reality. We’ve been there! In our previous jobs, we searched for a product that could replace our scrappy semi-solutions without draining internal resources; a solution that would continue to get developed and actually help us understand the full value of our actions. We couldn’t find one, so we decided to build it ourselves.Enter Dreamdata, the B2B revenue attribution platform for small to midsize B2B companies with the ambition to become data-driven. Our customers typically close multiple deals a month and do inside sales with a significant digital ad spend and annual revenue ranging from a few million to hundreds of millions of dollars. 
We pull together and clean existing, siloed, commercial data sources before joining them with behavioral data to give a holistic reflection of the actual B2B customer journey and transform it into easy-to-digest, actionable analysis.Setup and installationSign up for Dreamdata (if you do not already have an account)Follow one of the below steps to enable the Pipedrive integration in the Dreamdata product2.1 Install the integration from Pipedrive's MarketplaceInstall the Dreamdata - B2b Revenue Attribution application in the MarketplaceClick ""allow"" to enable Dreamdata to access your dataThis will redirect to the Dreamdata login page which will require you to log in with the account created in step 1Pipedrive is now enabled and Dreamdata can use this data to attribute revenue for your company2.2 Install integration from within the Dreamdata applicationGo to ""Integrations > Pipedrive"" and click ""Enable""Click ""allow"" to enable Dreamdata to access your dataPipedrive is now enabled and Dreamdata can use this data to attribute revenue for your companyResourcesWebsitePricingSupport websiteSupport emailTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyDocumentationIssue tracker",Dreamdata is a B2B revenue attribution platform.

Meetime is inside sales software that makes it easy for vendors to connect with their customers. The software is focused on the Brazilian market and is fully in Portuguese.

You can schedule or start a presentation instantaneously with Meetime. Activities representing demos will be created in the corresponding deal in Pipedrive. When a presentation or a demo ends, Meetime will mark the activity in Pipedrive as “done.”PORO Meetime é um software de Inside Sales que facilita a conexão de vendedores com seus clientes.A integração com o Pipedrive funciona da seguinte forma:Discador de Vendas: Você faz suas ligações clicando nos números de contato de cada negócio. O discador do Meetime será aberto com o número desejado já preenchido e você faz a ligação. Depois disso, a ferramenta vai criar a respectiva atividade realizada no Pipedrive e ela vai ser marcada como feita (se ela já tiver sido criada, o Meetime apenas marca como feita);Demonstração de Venda: Você agenda suas apresentações remotas ou as inicia na hora pelo Meetime. As respectivas atividades serão criadas dentro do negócio correspondente no Pipedrive.

There are just too many touchpoints and people involved in the buying decision, resulting in complex buyer journeys and long sales cycles. Transparency gets lost. Everyone knows that B2B revenue attribution is important, but where do you even start? The bigger the ad spend, the bigger the potential, but also the pain!To try and solve this, a lot of companies still rely on attribution systems that are stitched together in Excel from a mix of ill-maintained B2C tools, giving them a skewed view of their revenue reality. We’ve been there! In our previous jobs, we searched for a product that could replace our scrappy semi-solutions without draining internal resources; a solution that would continue to get developed and actually help us understand the full value of our actions. We couldn’t find one, so we decided to build it ourselves.Enter Dreamdata, the B2B revenue attribution platform for small to midsize B2B companies with the ambition to become data-driven. Our customers typically close multiple deals a month and do inside sales with a significant digital ad spend and annual revenue ranging from a few million to hundreds of millions of dollars. 
We pull together and clean existing, siloed, commercial data sources before joining them with behavioral data to give a holistic reflection of the actual B2B customer journey and transform it into easy-to-digest, actionable analysis.Setup and installationSign up for Dreamdata (if you do not already have an account)Follow one of the below steps to enable the Pipedrive integration in the Dreamdata product2.1 Install the integration from Pipedrive's MarketplaceInstall the Dreamdata - B2b Revenue Attribution application in the MarketplaceClick ""allow"" to enable Dreamdata to access your dataThis will redirect to the Dreamdata login page which will require you to log in with the account created in step 1Pipedrive is now enabled and Dreamdata can use this data to attribute revenue for your company2.2 Install integration from within the Dreamdata applicationGo to ""Integrations > Pipedrive"" and click ""Enable""Click ""allow"" to enable Dreamdata to access your dataPipedrive is now enabled and Dreamdata can use this data to attribute revenue for your companyResourcesWebsitePricingSupport websiteSupport emailTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyDocumentationIssue tracker",Dreamdata is a B2B revenue attribution platform.
