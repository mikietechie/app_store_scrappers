We want you, the Tableau Users, to be able to search and filter your data on how people really travel!   This extension is built with low code in mind so business users can ask questions – no longer a need to depend on specialist tools or resources to get this information.
Types of licenses:
Free – For non-commercial use only, with restricted quotas. Data provided and support provided by OpenRouteService.        https://openrouteservice.org/
Paid – For commercial purpose, with additional features and scalability to support business wide requirements. 
Social viz projects – For projects that socially matter, reach out and case by case we will review and give you free access.
Some of the use cases by industries –
Logistics – What postcodes can we deliver to within a certain time from a number of depots?
Retail – Between 5 coffee shops, what coverage of reachability do we have within 10 mins walking or 5 mins cycling time?
Retail – I want to open a new store, I need to do site analysis against my competitors in the area.
Travel – What Points of Interest are reachable within a certain walking time to my hotel.
Airports -What is the catchment area of my airport at a certain time of the day and I want to evaluate this using different transport modes.
Transport – What Point of Interests are reachable within a certain walking time e.g. between a number of nearby stations or bus stations.
Healthcare – I need to deliver new vaccines, what catchment areas are covered using delivery vans within a certain time. Or what areas are within a certain journey time from a hospital or clinics.
Transport – What is the combined reachability of two or more stations when their isochrones are merged?   Do we need to open a third station, or do they have sufficient coverage between them?
Many more can be found here
All in one extension!
Isolines – Create on the fly visualisations from origins and reachable areas, by mode of transport and other criteria’s. Find the intersection, combined reachable coverage as unions, population density, estimated rush hour effect (beta) and intervals.
Journey Matrix  - Get a matrix of journey time and insights by calculating many origins to many destinations.
GeoSpatial Filtering – Select your point of origin(s) to many destinations using different modes of transport and filter your data based on reachability.
Route Optimisation – Find the most the optimal route and number of agents required for number of way points (stops) using different modes of transport.
Geocoding (coming soon) – Make your data viable for spatial analysis, by converting address data to Latitude and Longitudes.",,Free,zsah,https://tableau.eqolines.com/Eqolines/dpq_si_eqolines.html,Tableau 2018.2 and laterTableau Public (2020.1 and later),,https://eqolines.com/,https://eqolines.com/privacy/,https://galleryapi.tableau.com/productfiles/Tableau%20Accelerator%20ELA.pdf,https://extensiongallery.tableau.com/extensions/300?version=2021.1

Let your users group data, use inline filters on columns, expand rows and export to csv and Excel. This fast performing table enriches your dashboard with extra context to your visualizations without any boundaries. It supports dashboard actions, it makes sure your calculations on aggregated data are correct and it offers your users the possibility to store their personal views on Tableau Server so they can start tomorrow where they stopped today.

DashboardUsage uses a local database to store information and this data can be used to power other dashboards, governed and secured right in Tableau!
Event tracking
Analyzing the events on your dashboard gives you more insight in how users interact with your dashboards. Configure which of these events you want to track and use insights to improve and design better dashboards! For example, remove the filters that are never clicked and make the marks that are clicked often more prominent.
Track Client information
With the brand new 2.0 version of DashboardUsage, you have more tracking capability than ever. Now, you’re able to track client information such as screen resolution and installed fonts. This allows you to tailor the dashboard experience for your users to serve them better dashboards. For example, use the most common screen resolution to size your dashboards so people have the best viewing experience.
Track Extension Usage
Another new feature in 2.0 is the ability to track extensions. This means you will be able to know on which dashboards certain extensions are being used. Create more awareness by knowing what extensions are being used on which dashboards so you know for example, which dashboards will be affected when you want to update one certain extension!

The chart presents a typical bubble chart but offers the capability of animating the bubbles through periods such as time. The bubbles resize and relocate for each period.
Bubbles can be represented as images. For example, if the data represent countries, a flag image can be used in place of a bubble. The image resizes and relocates just as the bubble does. Image can be either a URL link or embedded as Base64 text.
A user can pause the animation at any point and can then restart the animation or browse to the next or previous period.
Tooltips present a dotted line to each axis and the value of the bubble/image.
A variety of properties are available to the designer which include linear/log axes, show/hide pause panel, font/color editing and grouping options.

So far, static background images were used to make dashboards look better. However, a big disadvantage of using images is that when you’re rescaling the dashboards, the image proportions are not correct anymore. With this user friendly extension, all styled containers remain scalable and can be changed at any moment! You can even apply a new design to all containers with a single click. Never underestimate the power of a good looking and consistent (corporate) dashboard!
EasyDesigns
Design your dashboards without using photoshop or image manipulation. Have your Corporate Identity propagate throughout your dashboards, quickly synchronize the layout over multiple containers and fully customize the way your dashboard looks. All governed and secured in Tableau!
Drag the extension in your dashboard. Double click on the container to configure the layout. Select synchronize layout if needed and set up a custom dashboard layout in only a minute!
Create your Corporate Identity
Once you have created your desired layout, synchronize and share your results with your colleagues! In the Presets tab, themes can be saved and loaded/restored. To have a professional and consistent look at your dashboard, use a Preset file to load in your Corporate Identity. Use synchronize settings to update all containers that have these settings enabled. Changing your brand (i.e., a background color) can become very tedious when having many dashboards. Not anymore! Save your template centrally on your server and update all dashboards by only replacing or editing this file. 
Themes
In the Inspiration section, you can play around with the default themes. Use this to set up a nice container or get some inspiration quickly. Use presets to load and store all settings. Default settings can be imported and used to sync settings over multiple containers, this way all containers look the same!

You want to be able to see how sales would change based on a percentage increase or decrease. But, you want to do this analysis at the product category level with different percentages for each. Well, that would require you to create a parameter for each and every category and write a long calculation to match them up. Then if a new category gets added you need to go back and add another parameter and update your calculations. Who has time for that!? Instead, with the Quick What-If extension, you simply create one parameter and one calculation, and then you get a list of controllable inputs for each category to do your what-if analysis automatically!
How to use it

Before bringing in the extension make sure you have at least one worksheet on the dashboard that contains the dimension you want to pull values from. For example, if you wanted to do what-if analysis on the product categories like in the above image, you would need a worksheet on your dashboard with the ""Category"" dimension.
Next make a new string parameter that accepts all values. This will be your storage parameter where all input values are kept.
Now that your dashboard is set up, drag in a new extension object to your dashboard and select the Quick What-If extension.
In the configuration pop up select your storage parameter (which you made in step 2) and choose which worksheet and field you want to generate a list of inputs for.
Select how and when you want the inputs displayed within the options (more details below).
Save the configuration.
Create a new calculation with the following formula: {FIXED [Dimension]: MIN(FLOAT(REGEXP_EXTRACT([Parameter], [Dimension]+""\|(-?\d*\.?\d*)"")))}
where Dimension is the field you want to generate an input for and Parameter is your parameter.
Add this calculation to a view with your dimension.
Adjust the inputs in the extension to do your what-if analysis!

Options

Location of inputs: Where do you want the inputs to show up? You can choose between a modal pop-up window or inline on the dashboard.
Inputs to display: Do you want to see all inputs or only the ones for the items you selected?
Trigger: How do you want to trigger the inputs to show up? When you click on a mark or based on a button on the dashboard.
Unit label: Choose a label to display above the inputs to let users know what unit the numbers are.
Button text: If you are using the button option you can change the words found on it.

Note: If you are using options that eliminate the need for the inline dashboard zone to be displayed you can simply hide the extension by floating it and making it 1x1 pixel. You can always find it later in the layout pane.
How to install for local use

Make sure you have Node.js installed.
Clone or download and unzip this repository. Open the command line to the extension-quick-what-if master folder and run npm install to install the node modules.
In the command line run npm run build to build the extension.
Copy the files in the dist folder to your web server.
Update the existing or create a new manifest file (.trex) to point to the URL where you are hosting the extension.

We all thrive to create the most engaging, user-friendly dashboards based on feedback, but gathering detailed user behavior information at scale seemed to be an impossible challenge until now. With the power of Tableau Extensions, Starschema's Tableau Tracker enables you to easily measure and understand how people consume and interact with dashboards. Tableau Tracker can anonymously collect data like clicks and filter changes for every single user so you can create better visualizations and optimize performance based on usage patterns.
How Tableau Tracker Works

Anonymous data collection - Tableau Usage Tracker was built for the post-GDPR era, created with privacy by design in mind. It does not collect personally identifiable information from users like ID, name or email address.
Track every click in Tableau - Track and analyze filter changes, filter states, window size, workbook id, session time and more right within Tableau.
Pre-built Insights Dashboard - Understand behavior patterns instantly using the built-in dashboard created by Starschema's team of Data Visualization Heros.
Your Usage Data in your Tableau - Use our Web Data Connector to access your data

Benefits

Unlike other AI tools that are built primarily for the data scientist, Aible empowers everyone - including analysts and business users. With Aible, the focus is always on the factors driving the business - costs, benefits, organizational capacity. Aible is designed to maximize business impact. How? By training a portfolio of models that help optimize your business resources, even under changing business conditions.
With the Tableau extension from Aible, business users and analysts can not only embed predictions and recommendations directly within dashboards, but can also quickly conduct robust scenario analysis and multiple what-if testing. Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, Aible enables end users to adjust the AI predictions to be aggressive or conservative based on what they’re seeing on the frontlines, providing individualized recommendations for every part of the business directly from the Tableau interface. Aible automatically switches to the optimal model and along with the AI prediction, provides up to the minute insight on what drove the prediction, guidance on what action to take to maximize ROI, and an opportunity for each individual to provide feedback on the AI. The Aible Extension is free to licensed Aible users. Visit https://www.aible.com/tableau for details.
