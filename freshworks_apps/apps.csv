The timer automatically starts when the ticket is opened and turns off when the agent closes the tickets or when the agent moves to another tab, thereby ensuring that there are no errors in tracking the time spent on the ticket. The app records the start and stop time instances until the resolution of the ticket. This information can be found in  ‘Timesheet start and stop timer API’ which is sent to an assigned id. 

The Average Handling Time is calculated by accumulating the total amount of time agents spend on the Ticket details page and then dividing that number by the total number of tickets accessed. With the data from the AHT report, administrators will be able to assign tickets, streamline processes, and increase the productivity of agents.  

Features: 

Custom settings: Configure the Roles/Groups for which you would like to turn on the AHT app. 
Accurate Tracking: The timer turns on and off automatically. This includes when agents have moved to other tabs, the app senses if it’s not the active page and pauses the timer ensuring that you get the exact data with regard to time spent resolving a ticket.

- Multiple tickets support: now your customers can create and keep track of multiple Freshdesk tickets within the same Telegram bot. After sending a message to the bot, the user will be presented with a list of actions that will allow them to either add the message to one of their tickets as a reply, or to create a new ticket out of it;
- Required fields: setting certain ticket/contact fields as required could previously render Telegram Sync incapable of creating new tickets or users in your Freshdesk. With this update, we are addressing this issue by adding the ability to set default values for the required fields in the app settings.
- Text customization: this update introduces user interface for the customer side, extending the list of system messages far beyond the previous version. To ensure you are not bound to English as the default language, we have added the capability to change every line of system text, whether you want to translate it to your native language, or to just add some flair to it.
- Extended media support: you can now receive voice and video sent by your customers from Telegram. Additionally, some of the issues related to certain file types being sent from and to Telegram have also been fixed.

Telegram Sync allows you to turn a Telegram bot into a support channel. Simply create a bot (or use an existing one), and configure the app in just a couple of short steps. After the installation, any time someone sends a message to your Telegram bot, the app will present them with an action keyboard, allowing the user to create a new ticket out of their message, or add it to one of the previously created tickets.
Additionally, you can automatically assign new Telegram tickets to a specific agent group. You can also set default values for the required ticket/contact fields, as well as edit any line of app's system text.","First, input your Freshdesk domain and API key. The domain should look like this: 
domain.freshdesk.com (without “https://”).
You can find your API key in your Freshdesk profile settings.
Next, provide you Telegram bot token. If you don’t have a bot or don’t know where to find a token, search for the “BotFather” account in Telegram - you will find all the information there.
If you have any ticket or contact fields set as required, you should see them in the bottom section of the app settings after providing the domain and API key. Make sure to fill all of them - the app is not guaranteed to work otherwise. 
If you wish to reconfigure the app to use a different Telegram bot, you need to open the app settings, provide the new bot token, and then click the “Reconnect Telegram bot” button. This button can also be used if you experience any issues with the app.","Create tickets from messages sent to your Telegram bot, and send your agent replies back through it.",Paid,Published by Swedbyte,About 7 months ago in,"Works with

Remember the more tickets you use the better the model will be, if you do not choose a date we will take up to a thousand of the latest resolved tickets to train your initial machine learning model. Don’t worry you will be able to update the Machine Learning model using the FreshEngage External Console (https://freshdesk.iengage.io) after a successful initial setup.

You can proceed with the default Freshdesk Category - Ticket Type field, or if you have setup custom ticket properties you can select one from the list in that option. This is the Ticket property that will be updated using machine learning.

8. Hold Message: Select the hold message to play. This is played when Freshcaller is waiting to receive a response from the custom app based on the caller's input.
9. Create Routing Rules: Enter the response as TRUE to route calls that match the conditions configured in the app. Enter the response as FALSE to configure actions when the conditions don’t match. 10. Once you enter all the details, click Save.

The Slack app for Freshdesk simplifies communication and allows your agents to collaborate with teams in your organization in a streamlined fashion.

With the Slack app for Freshdesk, you can:
1. Deliver real-time notifications about new and updated tickets to public or private Slack channels using automation rules.
2.  Use the Freshdesk “Create Ticket” slash command in Slack to convert conversations with peers and customers directly to Freshdesk tickets.
3. Send Direct Messages (DMs) to agents about tickets that have been assigned or updated in their queue.

Update:
We’ve also partnered with Slack to build a Freshdesk app for Slack. The app allows you to sync ticket updates between a Freshdesk group and a Slack channel. Replies from internal teams come back into the ticket as private notes, making collaboration easier, and ensuring all context is recorded in one place.

Agents can now engage with their customers through Amazon Connect’s Call and Chat channels without having to move out of Freshdesk. The integration also gives additional context to agents in terms of previous chat, call or ticket histories raised in Freshdesk so that they can have more contextual and effective interactions. 

The custom app has two parts (i) a small modal and (ii) a full page app. The small modal allows basic call functionality including the following:

Accepting incoming calls and chats
Making outbound calls
Searching for numbers in call logs and contact lists
Saving unknown numbers into contacts module
Converting a call conversation to a ticket in Freshdesk
Adding notes related to a conversation

The full page app allows agents to extend their capabilities by:

Using Live Transcribe and Live Translate features
Connecting with customer through Chats
Making planned Auto-call outs to customers

CALLS
The call functionality can be managed in the small modal as well as the larger full page app. The full page app allows agents to leverage the additional features that are at their disposal such as:

Get additional caller meta-date from Amazon Connect
Live Transcribe: Capture the live transcription of the customer conversation as the call is progressing. This transcription then automatically gets added to the ticket created post the call for reference.
Live Translate: Translate the transcription of the call into the language of choice for the agent. This allows agents to ensure that they fully understand the customer requests if they were made in a different language than the language the agent is proficient in. The custom app currently supports translation to French, German and Hindi but this can potentially work in any language that AWS Translate supports. 
Auto Call out: Agents or supervisors can now send out automatic calls to customers to notify them of matters of interest. This feature allows agents to trigger calls that can be placed to multiple customers at once with a message of choice. The message can be typed in and the custom app automatically converts it into speech and dials the customer with that message. 

CHAT
Amazon Connect now has a chat channel in addition to the call channel. If customers prefer to converse with their businesses through chat then agents can now respond to these chats right from within Freshdesk. 

The custom app also fetches any previous call, chat or ticket records from the customer so that they can understand the issue and support the customer contextually. Chat conversations can also be converted into tickets, if the agent chooses to do so. 

An Agent can take upto 5 customer chats in parallel.

The integration works alongside Plivo, a business communication platform that allows organizations to connect and engage with their customers efficiently. More specifically, it utilizes the power of Plivo’s SMS API and combines it with Freshdesk’s helpdesk ticketing system. 
With the help of this integration, Freshdesk agents can receive text messages regarding the status of a particular Freshdesk ticket. The status in this context focuses on whether or not a query is opened, closed, or is in progress. 
The SMS generated by Plivo ensures that your helpdesk agents get real-time updates regarding the status of a ticket, even if they do not have access to their Freshdesk dashboard. 
The integration provides an efficient communication platform for your business by ensuring that the unavailability of the internet does not hamper your customer service efforts.

The SMS templates section on the right allows you to customize and enrich messages that you send from your helpdesk. In its description, you will notice that the App provides you with a list of tags. The tags allow you to include a ticket’s URL, number, and status to the message. 
A sample message is shown below: 
“The status of ticket: <ticket_number”> has now moved from <old_status> to <new_status>.”
Additionally, you can also create a New Reply/Public note to edit the body text for an outgoing message. 
 
Configuration:

Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Device42 version 16.12.00+
Freshservice agent account with access to the Freshservice Marketplace
Freshservice API token

To obtain the Freshservice API token
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to set up the Freshservice integration with Device42, a Freshservice API token is needed. This API token is used to import devices and software items to Freshservice as well as create relational mappings between them.

1) To retrieve the Freshservice API token login to your Freshservice dashboard with an agent profile.
2) Select the logged in user profile in the top-right corner of the page and navigate to profile settings.
3) Your API token will be displayed on the right side of the page. Copy this code as this will be required later to set up your integration in Device42.

To add the Freshservice token to Device42 secrets
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) From the Device42 navigation bar, go to Secrets.
2) On the top-right corner of the page, select Add Password.
3) Enter a name for the API token in the username field. This can be any value but remember this as it will be used to create the integration later.
4) Enter the Freshservice API token in the password field. Ensure that there are no whitespaces or new line characters before and after this API token.
5) To save the API token, click Save at the bottom-right corner of the page.

Set up integration in Device42
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Navigate to Tools > Integrations > External Integrations.
2) At the top-right of the page, select Add External Integration.
3) Enter the required fields on the page starting with your Freshservice URL (e.g. https://demo-instance.freshservice.com/).
4) From the Type dropdown field, select the Freshservice option.
5) For the Token field, select the magnifying glass and select the secret containing your Freshservice API token.
6) Once all the required fields are entered, copy the Verification Token displayed on the page. This will be used later to install the Device42 Freshservice App.
7) Click the Save button at the bottom-right corner of the page.

To install the Device42 integration app on Freshservice
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to use the Device42 integration application on your Freshservice instance, you will first need to install it.

1) Navigate to the settings page from the Freshservice dashboard.
2) From here, navigate to the Apps section from the Helpdesk Productivity panel. If you do not see this option on your Freshservice instance, ensure that you are logged in using an administrative account.
3) On the Apps page, select the Get More Apps button.
4) Search for Device42. If there is more than one application listed for Device42, ensure that you select the one named Device42 for Freshservice and that it allows you to install the application. If the application install button says ""Visit site to install"" then close the window and select the other Device42 application.
5) After selecting the install button you will be taken to a settings page where you will be asked to enter your Freshservice domain name (this is the part of your Freshservice URL between ""https://"" and "".freshservice.com""), a Cloud Connector as well as a verification token in order to proceed with the installation.
6) Enter the required fields. The Cloud Connector will be either connect.device42.net or connect-eu.device42.net. If you are unsure of which of the two to choose, navigate to Tools > Settings > Global Settings in Device42 and navigate to the bottom section of the page that says External Integration Settings. The Cloud Connector listed will determine which of the two Cloud Connectors you should choose. If this is not the case, please contact Device42 support and we will be happy to help you set up your Device42 to work with integrations.
7) Once the required fields are entered, you may proceed by selecting the install button at the bottom-left corner of the window.

To set up scheduled syncs and run manual syncs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Setting up and running syncs in Freshservice with the Device42 application is a very effective way of moving your discovered data from within Device42 to other platforms such as Freshservice. Our integration with Freshservice is meant to make this process as easy as possible by integrating directly with Freshservice and eliminating the need to setup environments and run scripts externally.

Scheduled sync
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Setting up scheduled sync is quick and easy with the Device42 application.

1) Go to the Device42 application settings page by navigating to Settings > Apps from the Freshservice Dashboard.
2) Under your installed applications, you will see the Device42 application. Select the settings icon for the application.
3) In the application settings page, you will now see an additional configurable option. To use the scheduled sync option, ensure that you select the checkbox and choose your desired time to run scheduled syncs. The scheduled sync will run daily at the specified time and is used to bring in new CIs as well as update existing ones in Frehservice.
4) Select save to apply these scheduled sync settings.

Manual sync

   Full Sync - Sync all items from Device42 to Freshservice regardless of when that item was added or updated in Device42.

   Partial Sync - Sync items that have changed in Device42 (either added or updated) since the time of the last successful sync.

To view sync history
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Viewing synchronization history is useful for debugging issues as well as seeing the number of devices brought into Freshservice.

1) Go to the Device42 application settings page by navigating to Settings > Apps from the Freshservice Dashboard.
2) Under your installed applications, you will see the Device42 application. Select the settings icon for the application.
3) From the displayed options, select the Sync History button. From here you can view previous synchronizations as well as currently running ones. You may select a row from the sync history table to view logs, if any, that are associated with it. The displayed text is limited to ~4000 characters. When downloading full logs, use the download full log button located on the bottom-left corner of the text area.

To view mapped and unmapped data for specific assets
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We understand that there are some fields in Device42 that may not easily translate to a field in Freshservice.

To view mapped and unmapped data for a device within Freshservice.

1) Navigate to Assets > Inventory from the Freshservice Dashboard.
2) On this inventory screen, select an asset that was imported from Device42 that you would like to view mapped and unmapped data for.
3) On the right panel of the page, you will see the Device42 application. Click this to expand the application.

- User Management
- Group Management
- Document Management
- Document sharing
- Folder Management

Freshservice’s integration with Box for SaaS Management enables you to track and manage users using Box directly within Freshservice. Integrating with Box enables you to:
- Track users using Box and how frequently they use Box (not just by login, but also create/update files in Box) to 
identify inactive users for de-provisioning

This integration requires the SaaS Management Add-on. More details can be found here: https://support.freshservice.com/en/support/solutions/articles/50000003270","Note: To start using Box API you need to set up a Custom App using server-side authentication

View detailed instructions to set up the integration here: https://support.freshservice.com/en/support/solutions/folders/50000000561

1. App creation

 - Log into Box and navigate to Developer Console > Create New App.
 - Select Custom App from the list of application types. A modal will appear to prompt a selection for the next step.
 - Select Server Authentication (with JWT) to verify application identity with a key pair. Then, provide a name for your application and click Create App.

Note: Once you make a selection, you will not be able to change to a different authentication method without creating a new application.

2. Basic configuration

 - Application Access: To work with existing Managed Users of the enterprise, navigate to Developer console > Configuration Tab > Application Access Settings. Set to App Access + Enterprise Access.

 - Application Scopes: Select all the scopes listed under Application scopes in order to perform app actions. See the scopes guide for detailed information on each option here (https://developer.box.com/guides/api-calls/permissions-and-errors/scopes/)


 3. Public and Private Key Generation

 Once a Custom App is created leveraging Server Authentication with JWT, a key pair can be generated via the Configuration tab within the Developer Console. 

 - To generate the keypair configuration file, navigate to Developer Console > Configuration tab > Add and Manage Public Keys section

 - Click the Generate a Public/Private Keypair button to have Box generate a keypair for you. This will trigger the download of a JSON configuration file that you can use in your application as input to Box config param.

Note: For security reasons, Box will not store your private key. If you lose your private key, you will need to reset the entire key pair.

4. App Authorization 

Before the application can be used, a Box Admin needs to authorize the application within the Box Admin Console.

 - Navigate to Developer Console > Authorization Tab.
 - Click Submit and Review to send an email to your Box enterprise Admin for approval. 

5. App Installation Parameter

To install and authenticate the app you need to provide the following input: 

 - Box Config - Copy it from the JSON file downloaded while generating a Public and private key pair

The following two parameters are required for attaching documents to your Freshservice tickets as either a note or directly to a new ticket.

The solution… Arrangr’s FREE app!
 
Maybe you need to follow up when they have more time for a call. Perhaps you need to connect them to a teammate, supervisor, or level two support staff to take the next step. Maybe you were away for their message, and now need to schedule a time to talk. Or perhaps you just need to do some research before following up with them later. 
 
Whenever these situations arise, Arrangr is your best solution! Whether scheduling a meeting with yourself or a teammate, for a phone call, video call, or even in-person meeting, Arrangr makes it fast, easy, and frictionless. 
 
Arrangr’s FreshChat app has rich functionality and abilities:
 
- Send them a few times to select from - the time slots will show up as buttons they can choose right in the chat.

- Send them one of your scheduling links - you can have different links tailored toward different occasions. For example, you can send your “Demo” link to set up demos, or your “Onboarding” link to set up client onboarding sessions.

- Browse through your teammates and then select one of their scheduling links to share.

- Arrangr’s meeting page can give you a link to pull up the original FreshChat conversation, providing you with crucial context for the meeting.

- In one click, compose an email to them with the scheduling link included. This can be useful if they have left the chat, or if they aren’t able to use the link immediately.

- Save your most frequently shared links for quick access (your own links or teammates’ links)

Once a ticket has been closed and time-sheets finalized, the agent can select the “Create Invoice” button to create a draft invoice in Xero.

If the Ticket Requester’s Company name or email ID matches a contact in Xero, agents can link the ticket to an existing invoice instead of creating a new one. But if there is no contact that matches the ticket requester, a new contact will be created in Xero with the Requester Name when the invoice is created.

When an agent clicks on “Create Invoice” or “Edit” the time-sheet from the current ticket will be automatically populated on the draft invoice screen. In case this is an “Edit” action and the invoice already has existing time-sheet entries from another ticket, then those entries would be read-only. Agents can associate each time-sheet entry with an inventory item. Agents will be able to select only those items which Admins have authorized for display via the app configuration page.

If an inventory item from Xero is selected, then the unit price and related tax rates will be automatically applied in Xero. If no inventory item exists or if an agent chooses not to link an inventory item with a time-sheet entry, agents will have to select an “Account” name. This “Account” name will be applied to all time-sheet entries which do not have inventory items linked with them.

Once an agent has filled in all the details, clicking on the “Create” button will link the resulting Xero draft invoice to the Freshdesk ticket. Subsequently, on the ticket details page, agents can see the invoice name and current status of the invoice. They can also view additional details of the invoice at any time by clicking on the “View” link.

Admins have to approve draft invoices in Xero before it is sent out to customers. Admins will also have the ability to delete invoices from Xero.","Follow these steps to set up your Xero app for Freshdesk:

“Sales” will always be selected by default. If “Sales” does not exist, the first account that exists under “Revenue” in Xero will be considered default.

Inventory:
Specify which Inventory items you want agents to access when creating draft invoices. The time sheet entries can be associated to Xero inventory items that have a selling price set according to the hourly rate that a business wants to charge a customer. This rate would therefore be applied to the invoiced line items (timesheet entry) and the total invoice value will be calculated automatically.

The `identity_api_token` has to be generated from your instance of Identity by creating a new  API user.

`bundle exec rails console`

`heroku run bundle exec rails console`

Features of the app:
• The user can configure the direction of sync from the CRM to Freshdesk Support Desk or vice versa or both.
• The sync happens seamlessly every 12 hours.
• The user can map the fields in the CRM to fields in Freshdesk Support Desk which means that the user has control over the transformation of data.","To enable the integration,

• Opinyin's AI reads all your free text feedback and automatically highlights customer pain and pleasure points. Opinyin also provides unique Comparative Linguistic Analysis Scores™ based on how your customers say they feel, letting you quickly see past those sometimes-unfair given scores.
•    You get a real-time snapshot of both given and linguistic analysis scores as well as trends over any date period. A full list of ticket linked responses, and a powerful topic explorer with AI-driven meaning filters,  quickly gets you to the reasons for your scores.
•   You can send an unlimited number of invites to fully branded, web-based Surveys with any number of linked industry-standard satisfaction measurement questions (NPS®, CES, CSAT).
•    It's all in Freshdesk; you and your customer's personally identifiable information never has to leave your Freshdesk domain.

Either optionally, when inserted in a message by an Agent, or automatically, when a ticket is closed using custom canned responses for each group, the Opinyin App sends out Survey Invites directly from your Freshdesk domain. Your customers get to quickly tell you about what's important to them in a simple and conversational style that borrows much from social media engagement techniques and is proven to get response rates with highly valuable free-text feedback, well above industry standard benchmarks.

Every response is attached to the related ticket in Freshdesk as well as inserted into the ticket history and can automatically reopen closed tickets on negative feedback. Also, responses can be filtered by pain and pleasure points to see key topics of interest quickly.

Full access to a dedicated admin portal provides custom survey creation as well as account management at an unmatched monthly or annual subscription price.

Step 1 – Opinyin Account Creation:

1.    Go to www.opinyin.com/register to register for your Opinyin Account. There is a free 21-day trial, and you will not be asked for card details until you chose to continue using Opinyin.
2.    You will get an email asking you to verify your email address. Check your spam folder if it does not arrive. 
3.    Verify your email address and login.
4.    The Opinyin portal will guide you in creating your first Survey where you will be able to set up a single or multi-question Survey using industry-standard NPS®, CES, and CSAT templates.
5.    On the Opinyin menu sidebar, click Settings > Integrations in the Opinyin menu sidebar and make a note of your API key. You will need it for the Freshdesk Configuration.
 
Step 2 – Freshdesk Configuration

Pre-requisites: 
1.    Your Opinyin API key (obtained from your Opinyin Account – see above).
2.	At least one Opinyin Survey created in the Opinyin Survey Admin Portal.
3.    Your Freshdesk subdomain name. This is the first part of your Freshdesk web address - the 'yourcompany' in yourcompany.freshdesk.com.
4.    Your Freshdesk API key. Obtain this from the Profile Settings page. Please note that you should be an administrator on Freshdesk.
5.    Revamped Ticket Fields enabled in your Freshdesk account. If not, a warning is displayed when you install the Opinyin Surveys App. Contact Freshdesk support who will enable this feature for you.
6.    At least one Canned Response in a folder that Agents can access. It should be the Survey invite message to send to the customer when a ticket is closed. Insert the following tag  [opinyin-survey-link]  in square brackets in the canned response place where you want to insert the hyperlink to the Opinyin Web survey widget precisely as shown. You can create as many canned responses as you want if you would like different text for different Groups. Additionally, you can create a Canned Response with a Survey link that Agents can manually insert into a reply. Please note that due to platform limitations, we only support the following placeholders in Canned Responses used for survey invites:

•    {{ticket.requester.firstname}}
•    {{ticket.requester.lastname}}
•    {{ticket.requester.name}}
•    {{ticket.subject}}
•    {{ticket.id}}
•    {{ticket.agent.name}}
•    {{ticket.group.name}}
•    {{ticket.agent.email}}

Assigning Surveys to Groups:
1.    Click install, and the admin page is displayed.
2.    Enter your Freshdesk domain, Freshdesk API key, and your Opinyin API key and click Continue.
3.    If you have entered these correctly, you will see a message saying 'fetching details'. The App is getting details of the surveys you have configured on the Opinyin Server. The configuration options will then appear. If you have entered anything incorrectly, you will get an error message to help you. 
4.    Select the folder in which you have created your Survey invite Canned Response.
5.    In the table, select a Freshdesk Group from the dropdown in the first column.
6.    In the next column, select the Opinyin Survey you want to assign to the Group in the previous column. 
7.    Select the Canned Response used when a ticket is closed for the selected Group in the next column.
8.	Select a Canned Response you would like to provide for Agents to insert manually into a reply. If you do not wish to offer a Canned Response, you can choose the <insert survey link> option, which will insert just the Call to Action text specified in the next step as a hyperlink.
7.    Enter the Call to Action text you would like to insert in a survey invite as a hyperlink to the appropriate Survey. It will replace the tag mentioned previously in the Canned Response, or if Agents have the option to insert the link in a message, then it will appear where they place the cursor as a hyperlink to the Survey.
8.    Choose from the final dropdown what type of responses you would like to reopen a ticket automatically.  When the ticket is reopened, it will also have a tag added to it automatically based on the type of feedback received i.e. 'negative feedback'
9.    Click the + button if you want to add another group and repeat the process above.

Step 3 – App Configuration

Choose when and how often to send Surveys:

•    Minimum Period Between Surveys: This allows you to set how often you survey the same requester. This type of setting is usually called Survey throttling. It is essential as customers find over surveying annoying, and it will reduce response rates. Typically 30 days is a good setting; however, this will depend on the nature of your business. Opinyin can advise on this. 

•    Survey Send Event: Decide if you only want to send Survey invites when a ticket is closed, when the Agent inserts a survey in the ticket reply editor using the Opinyin toolbar button , or both.

•    Delay Send: It is essential to judge the best engagement time for your requesters to get the best response rates. This lets you set how long the system will wait after a ticket is resolved/closed before it sends the Survey Invite email. If a ticket is reopened by the Agent or by a Freshdesk Automation before the scheduled send time, the Survey Invite email will not be sent if the ticket status is not closed or resolved at the time it was originally scheduled to be sent.

•    Send When Reopened Ticket Closed: Lets you decide if you want to send Survey invites for reopened tickets. It is an important consideration to avoid over surveying. However, the minimum period between Surveys will override this, which means even if a ticket is reopened and closed again, the requester will not receive another Survey invite within the Minimum Period Between Surveys.

Email configuration setting:

•    Email Config: This lets you assign which mailbox you would like to be used to send out Survey invite emails. We recommend that you consider using your standard support mailbox in case of a requester replying directly to the Survey invite email with an issue.

•    Survey Invite Email Subject Line: This allows you to define the text you would like requesters to see in the subject line of the Survey invite email. The text ' - Related Ticket: [ID] ' where [ID] will be the originating ticket number, will always be appended to this.

•   Default Group for Survey Emails: By default, Freshdesk creates a new ticket for every outbound email. The status of the ticket created is closed, and the group allocation will be the same as the originating ticket. However, this option allows you to assign a specific group for all the Survey Invite tickets, which can avoid confusion and clutter in the ticket views as well as the reporting.

•   Send System Notifications To: This is the person who is emailed if there are any issues preventing the App from sending surveys.  Typically this is the email address of the person who manages your Freshdesk account.

Permissions for users:

•    Permission To Exclude Responses: This lets you decide which roles have permission to exclude responses from the Opinyin data in Freshdesk. The exclusion feature provides the ability to remove spam Survey responses from the analysis.  Once excluded, only Opinyin support can reinstate them, so use this feature with caution.

•    Override Agent View Restriction: By default, Agents can only see survey response data for themselves. Selecting this option will override this and allow them to see survey response data for all agents in their assigned groups.

Exclude specific tickets and contacts from automatically generating survey invite emails when tickets are closed:

•    Ignore Surveys (Tickets): This allows you to specify a custom tick box on your ticket form, which, if ticked, will prevent the sending of a Survey invite when the ticket is closed.

•    Ignore Surveys (Contacts): This allows you to specify a custom tick box on your contact form, which, if ticked, will prevent the sending of a Survey invite to that Contact at any time.

•    Ignore Ticket Types: If a ticket is set to a type matching that which included in this configuration, a survey invite will not be sent out when the ticket is closed.

Step 4 – Using Opinyin in Freshdesk

Opinyin will work seamlessly in Freshdesk. If you have configured it, it will send a survey invite email when a ticket is closed. The process within Freshdesk will create a new ticket assigned to the user whose API key you used during setup.  It will create a ticket with a subject relating it to the original ticket, with a type' Opinyin Survey', assigned to a specific Group if configured, and tagged as 'opinyin-survey', so that you may filter these out if you do not wish to see them in views or reports.

Alternatively if configured, Agents can insert Canned Responses with Survey links in a reply, or wherever they place the cursor in a ticket reply, just the Call to Action text as a hyperlink to the Survey, by clicking the Opinyin Surveys icon on the toolbar at the very bottom of the Reply Editor. Unlike invites sent out automatically on ticket close, this email is sent from the Agent and remains with the original ticket.

The Opinyin Surveys icon on the sidebar menu provides access to both real-time and historical survey data. You can filter the data by date range as well as by customer, Group, or Agent. The App fully respects Freshdesk Group and Role assignments so Agents will only be allowed to see data subject to their assigned permissions.

Reports include:

•	Snapshot of your given scores and Opinyin's unique AI-powered Comparative Linguistic Analysis Scores (CLAS)™ over the selected period.  
•	AI-powered pleasure and pain points as well as a list of the response you can filter by score.
•	Topic explorer with AI-driven linguistic analysis filters to discover the reasons for your scores. 
•	Daily and 30-day rolling score trends.

Spend less time on support and more time selling! 

Answer Directly from Freshdesk

ChannelReply lets you answer all your buyer messages as easily as emails. You can even answer tickets like eBay Resolution Center cases and Walmart escalations. Just write a reply and send!

View Buyer & Order Info

See everything you need to know about the buyer and their order:

Buyer Name – Shipping Address – Order Status – Item Title – Amount Paid – Parent and Variation SKUs – ASIN – Positive eBay Feedback Percentage – Walmart Fulfillment Option – Shopify Shipping Service Level – Back Market Product ID – Dozens of Other Details

Use Ecommerce Data in Freshdesk’s Best Tools

Pull order info into Freshdesk ticket fields to save countless hours on support. Turn info like tracking ID and order status into placeholders for canned responses. Or, use specific order details to build powerful automations.

Create Autoresponders That Actually Work

Marketplaces filter out most autoreplies, but ChannelReply fixes that. Build custom autoresponders that are fully compatible with Amazon, eBay, Back Market and more. Finally, you can enjoy your weekends again!

Take Marketplace Actions in Freshdesk

   •   Amazon: Request reviews or mark messages as “No response needed”
   •   eBay: Process returns, cancellations, and Resolution Center cases
   •   Walmart: Cancel or acknowledge orders or update shipping statuses
   •   Shopify: Refund orders, cancel and restock at the same time, or edit buyer or order details
   •   Back Market: Upload tracking info, validate orders, and process refunds

Remove Rule-Breaking Text

Most marketplaces have rules against links and contact info in messages. With ChannelReply’s text remover, you can autodelete specific text so you never get in trouble.

Receive All Your Notifications

Forward all your critical one-way notifications to Freshdesk. ChannelReply makes it easy to receive A-to-z claims, cancellations, new orders and more.

Get Clean, Threaded Tickets

Without ChannelReply, marketplace messages come with screen after screen of unwanted text. Plus, any buyer message can create a new ticket, even when it’s a reply to an old ticket. ChannelReply removes the clutter and threads tickets properly.

Time and customers are your most valuable assets. Add ChannelReply to Freshdesk to save time and serve your customers better than ever before!

79% of contact centres acknowledge that they have customers who do not speak the primary language that they offer. But only 66% have formal customer support options in a language other than English. Helpdesk agents can struggle to manage enquiries from customers in a language that is not native to them, leading to frustration on both sides, inability to resolve the customer’s issue, and poor customer experience. 

Awaken Translate as a Service plugs into Freshdesk to enable real-time conversational translation capabilities in 30+ languages. Bi-directional voice and text translation allow your customers to send tickets in their native language. The agent will then see the ticket translated into their native language and be able to respond; the agent’s response in turn will be translated back into the customer’s language. 

In an increasingly global business environment, customers expect that their tickets be answered in their native language. Unfortunately, multilingual agents come at a premium and can be difficult to find. Our platform enables you to use your existing team to respond in your customers’ native language thereby providing a better customer experience whilst reducing your agent costs.

Key Benefits:
-	Provide multilingual support to your customers’ tickets at a greatly reduced cost.
-	Increase your CSAT scores by answering your customer tickets in their native language.
-	Enable supervisors to perform quality assurance across all multilingual tickets.
Key Features:
-	Seamlessly integrates with Freshdesk – automatically translates a customer’s ticket into the agent’s native language.
-	Awaken Translate for Freshdesk uses artificial intelligence to produce conversational translations, rather than the literal translations most machine translation engines use, that are difficult to understand.
-	If requested, a full audit trail of the original and translated communications can be stored.",To understand more about Awaken Translate for Freshdesk and if you would like to trial the solution please email hi@awaken.io,Real-time conversational translations that help you respond in your customers' native tongue.,Free,,About over 1 year ago in,"Works with

Each ticket shows your custom Zingtree agent script as a pop-over, and includes the history of steps taken by the agent. If a ticket is transferred to another agent, the new agent can see all the steps previously taken, and also resumes at the same place in the troubleshooter as the previous agent.

In addition, agents can use the steps taken in the decision tree to generate ticket notes. This is incredibly helpful for agents, as they can spend less time entering notes manually. Notes that are generated can be edited before final submission.

Zingtree.com is a toolkit for building these scripts. Once your experts build the scripts, management and authors can view reports to see how each script is being used.  Individual agents can be tracked, and you can also see aggregate reports on traffic through various parts of your decision trees.

Agents also have the ability to send feedback to authors at any point in the tree. This is invaluable, as it makes agents a part of the quality process, and makes it easy for authors to continually improve the knowledge in the tree.

Hosting all these new servers and machines securely and at a reasonable cost can be a challenge. Freshservice’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) integration makes it easier.

Integrating AWS with Freshservice will help with the following:

- The CMDB organizes your CI and asset details, while your virtual assets are handled by our cloud solution’s AWS integration. All the instances you store in your AWS account are linked to the CMDB in your Freshservice account. You can attach instances from your CMDB to tickets, problems, changes and releases in your service desk, similar to how you would attach other CIs.

- Get access to virtual servers (EC2), databases (RDS) and volumes (EBS) in your centralized CMDB, and visualize the AWS servers using our relationship MAP view. This helps you to gauge impact and analyse your cloud and end-user assets on a single platform. Use smart service desk automation to add new instances, update existing ones, and terminate them as required.

- Keep tabs on your cloud-based virtual assets in the same way you track your CIs. Easily access information on contract type, cost, expiry and renewal dates, and get necessary alerts and notifications within your service desk, bringing control of all your physical and virtual assets under one roof. You can provide admin access to select agents in charge of asset tracking — once all the instances sync with your CMDB, your agents can securely access all virtual assets and inventories within AWS from Freshservice.","Please click on the link below so you can be redirected to the solution article with detailed information on the installation process.

After linking, replies and comments made in a Freshdesk ticket will be pushed to Asana, and vice versa! The app can also push ticket status updates to linked Asana tasks via comments. 

Creating Asana tasks from Asana Connect lets you choose a team and a project for the to-be-created task, set assignee and due date, and even fill out custom fields - all right from the app!","IMPORTANT: We strongly recommend you to create a bot user in Asana and use his credentials to authorize the app. This approach lets you configure what teams, projects and tasks are visible in the app (and to Freshdesk agents), and ensures that changes made in Asana (such as created tasks and comments) will have an appropriate author, eliminating any confusion. 

After installing the app, you will be prompted to authorize the app in Asana. Use your bot user credentials (which we recommend), or just authorize the app from any user. Be careful: the app will see all tasks, teams and projects that the authorized user sees! 

After authorizing in Asana you will be directed to the app installation page. Provide your Freshdesk domain name and API key (preferably from someone with admin access), and choose an Asana workspace/organization the app will work with. You can also prevent certain updates from being pushed by using the corresponding checkboxes.

After the first installation you can open the app settings again to customize the app text. If you want to translate the app to a different language, or simply change some of the text in the app, you can do it by clicking the ""Customize app text"" button and providing custom text for any piece of text used in the app. It's as simple as that!

You can find the installed app in the right sidebar of the ticket details page. From there, you can create (and automatically link) a new task from a Freshdesk ticket, or link the ticket to an existing task by searching for it in your Asana workspace/organization. After linking, all new notes and replies, as well as status update changes will be automatically pushed to Asana. Comments on Asana tasks will also be added to the ticket as private notes once every 5 minutes. If you need to see an update right away, you can use the ""Manual update"" button in the app. If you wish to stop pushing and receiving updates, just click the ""Unlink task"" button.","Connect Freshdesk tickets to Asana tasks (new or existing), and see updates in both systems!",Paid,Published by Swedbyte,About 10 months ago in,"Works with

This gives customers one more possible way to reach out and connect with your business, reducing barriers in customer communications.
 
When customers send a message to your Message Media number, it either creates a new message thread on Freshchat or updates an existing one. 

The Message Media app supports multiple phone numbers as well, each of which can be assigned to groups of agents responsible for a particular kind of customer query. When a message is received, it is automatically routed to the concerned group of agents, increasing efficiencies in the customer service department. 

Plus, the Message Media app also lets agents proactively initiate a conversation with customers instead of just replying to messages received. 

By adding an SMS communication channel to Freshchat, you can improve customer loyalty, reduce friction in customer service, and make customers feel more comfortable when talking to agents. 

- Key Features of Message Media with Freshchat Integration

* 2-way SMS communication
* Choose a default Channel ID where all incoming messages will be routed

At the bottom of the settings screen, you’ll find the URLs for the webhooks. Copy and paste the Message Media webhook URL and enter it on Message Media webhook settings and the Freshchat webhook URL and enter it on your Freshchat webhook field.
