Features such as GPS tracking, IP punch security, automatic lunch deduction, punch rounding, shift schedules, weekly/daily overtime, and weekly/daily double time. Reporting such as timesheets, summaries, who's in reports, and punch exception reports. And equally important, fast, friendly customer service.","Clockwurk seamlessly integrates with QuickBooks Online. Simply connect your account, then import your workers. Simple as that. Workers can track time from anywhere and from any device. They can also track time from one of our cloud-based time clock terminals. But the real advantage of Clockwurk is what it does. It transfers worker start/stop times in real-time, enters those times on a QuickBooks timesheet, and separates any overtime or PTO hours on individual rows... just like an employee time clock system.

Simple RM can run fully automated. Just flip a switch and review requests will be sent any time a job is completed. If you prefer, you can be the one to trigger each and every review request that is sent. Be as in control or hands off as you choose. Either way, you still benefit from the professionally designed email templates, conversion optimized review collection flow and smart sending schedule.","Get more reviews for your Google My Business Listing by requesting them from recent customers using the contact information in your QuickBooks Online account.

The app also tries to match customers in QuickBooks Online with people who have already left Google reviews. If a QuickBooks customer is someone who already gave a review they will not receive a request.'}, {'question': 'Can I customize the review requests?', 'answer': 'Yes, you can brand everything that customers see with your company colour and logo.

Next, you will define the COA for the parent and be sure to take care of any deferred COA maintenance in your existing companies (aka the ?Subsidiaries). With your companies set, you?re ready to sign up with JustConsolidate and complete the onboarding tasks of connecting your companies and mapping the COA?s. After the setup is complete, you?re ready to run consolidations using JustConsolidate to load prior periods and finally run consolidated financials in QuickBooks.",JustConsolidate was designed for bookkeepers and accountants to consolidate multiple companies into a new QuickBooks company you create to manage and report your consolidated financials. An initial setup connects the new consolidation company (aka Parent) and existing ?subsidiary? companies followed by a mapping of the chart-of-accounts. Consolidated financials for a fiscal period are created when extracted balances for each subsidiary are translated into the COA (and currency) of the Parent and posted as simple journal entries into the consolidation company where all reporting is performed.,"Imagine your multiple companies translated and consolidated into one QuickBooks Online company.

The uniqueness of field service in the industrial market makes it exceedingly difficult for a small company to find off-the-shelf field service software that covers the entire lifecycle of a service operation.

Let us show you how.","TrackLogica brings together ""many pieces of the puzzle"" under one roof and aims at complementing, not duplicating, the functions of your QuickBooks. As your primary system of record, financial functions that can be done inside QuickBooks should be done there.

TrackLogica is exactly this and takes this philosophy even further.","TrackLogica will help you manage core Field Service Management (FSM) functions such as scheduling, employee skill matrix, training records, custom forms, SOP's, calendars, time capture, task assignments, definition of scope of work, and more.
Beyond FSM functionality, TrackLogica incorporates Quality Management technology right in the middle of the app, facilitating the adoption of best practices and repeatable processes, which are both key building blocks of Growth Strategies.
TrackLogica provides tools to capture and maintain a database of your Customer Assets by location, type, category, manufacturer, etc. along with maintenance records.

Here?s how you get started

 - Scan, snap or email a copy of the document you want to capture
 - AutoEntry extracts and analyzes your data
 - Once done, items will appear in your inbox for you to approve into QuickBooks
 - If you prefer, AutoEntry will auto-publish known vendors saving even more time","No more manual data entry: For bills, receipts, sales invoices, bank and card statements and more, AutoEntry automates data entry.

3)	PRINT: When you click on ?Print?, all checks that have been generated will be printed to the printer that you select. You can select checks individually if you do not want to print all generated checks.
