It gives to you the chance to sort and prioritize tickets by business importance, problem emergency, product group or customer group. However, manual classification requires up to 10% of the overall working time so automation is the key for whole helpdesk performance.
Classifier is the easy-to-use, fully automatic, created on the state-of-art Artificial Intelligence technology tool with comprehensive taxonomy which covers all categories for e-commerce, retail, streaming, entertainment (including e-gaming), subscriptions, software, telecom, finance, banking, fintech, insurance, healthcare, travel, and any transactional or shipping/logistics business. All that you need for successful business from the box.

Speed, Quality and Cost of answering matter…\ Classifier uses machine learning to analyze and classify inbound conversations, which can activate processes that expedite customer and support agents’ experience for more valuable engagement
Enabler for Automation (Use the ticket classification as key enabler for your helpdesk routine automation):


Classify tickets and automate Rules. Business rules and workflow engines can perform simple to complex tasks, like escalate conversations or update data based on class recognized by Classifier. Smart ticket workflow saves about 25% of total Support Cost (high performance, less staff, less infrastructure cost…)

Join hundreds of organizations creating more than half a million tasks each month to improve their agent workflows with checklists, sub-tickets and project automation.
 ""Tasks saves us 15%-20% of agent time for common customer scenarios""
— José Luna, CTO, Eventplicity
 ""We have many processes that take multiple steps and Tasks has taken the heavy lifting out of managing them""
— Craig Willis, Senior Director Customer Support, Host Analytics
When you first start using the Tasks app, you'll notice how easy it is to create, reorder and complete tasks on the fly. And for lists of tasks that you find yourself using over and over again, you can save them for re-use and apply them to any ticket whenever you need. You can even have them added to tickets automatically! But, that is only the tip of the iceburg when it comes to what this powerful project management tool can help you achieve in Zendesk... 
Applying multiple saved task lists to a ticket:

You can choose to group task lists together which makes larger projects easier to manage. 
For more complicated workflows you can convert tasks into sub-tickets (aka child tickets). This allows you to divvy out and assign different tasks across your team. It also allows you to split out matters that require separate conversations with people or organizations other than the original requester, while still keeping the tickets and tasks linked to the main project. This makes it a powerful alternative to Zendesk 'side conversations'.
If you already know the contents of a sub-ticket, you can pre-define it using 'Ticket Templates'. This allows you to specify things like the subject, description, assignee etc. and any information that you'd like to copy from the parent ticket at the point it is created. 
Converting a task into a pre-defined sub-ticket using a ticket template:

Some processes are well-trodden paths and you shouldn't have to re-invent the wheel every time they need to happen. This app allows you to automatically add task lists and create pre-defined sub-tickets based on ticket conditions specified in a trigger. This ensures that certain tasks are always completed as part of your process. It's a New Hire ticket? The 'Employee Onboarding' task list will already be present and nobody will ever wonder where the coffee machine is again! 
Features

Create and complete ad-hoc tasks on any ticket.
Save task lists for re-use.
Preview task lists before adding them to a ticket. 
Either group saved task lists together or add them as separate items. 
List control. Easily move tasks and grouped task lists around on a ticket.

Ticket templates allow the conversion of task list items into pre-defined tickets. 
Automatically add task lists (& sub-tickets) to tickets based on ticket conditions.
Set tasks to tag tickets when completed allowing for creative workflows in Zendesk. 
View logs of who created, completed and deleted all tasks on each ticket.
Access control over who can create ad-hoc tasks, add/create task lists or delete tasks.

ViiBE for Zendesk promises the best remote diagnosis thanks to live video stream combined with AR and collaborative tools. ViiBE helps you optimise your customer experience and reduce on-site travels.
Customer pain points prior to integrating ViiBE into Zendesk:

  Voice communications are limited when detailing with technical incidents
  Customers in need of assistance have difficulties making their issues understood
  Subsequent incomplete diagnosis of the problem
  Needing several calls to establish an accurate diagnosis (low FCR)
  Long lasting customer device and machine downtime
  Expensive travels for technicians to help customers
  Too long of time to resolve incidents, leading to unsatisfied customers (low NPS)

With ViiBE, you can optimise FCR up to 25%, NPS over 30%, and reduce Tech dispatch by 20%.
What is our service?
We provide a dedicated subdomain of ViiBE to our clients. This allows them to use our video communication interface and access their dedicated back-office.
Once the ViiBE app is enabled through your Zendesk platform, simply open a ticket and a ViiBE call button will be embedded so you can immediately start making ViiBE calls.
In the communication interface, a help desk agent can send a link to the customer in need of assistance to start the call. In one click and without download, this person will have access to a ViiBE video communication with the expert. They can then use various collaborative tools to diagnose and solve the problem.
ViiBE call features:

  Superimposing one’s pointer over the video feed
  Taking high-quality pictures and drawing on them
  Sending and saving files
  Sending messages in the chat box
  Sharing one’s screen
  Choosing to analyse the scene via the front or the back camera

When the communication ends, both the call center agent and customer are asked to give their opinions about the quality of the call. This exit ticket helps track KPIs such as NPS, FCR, and customer satisfaction.
Each call creates a new ticket which is accessible in the back-office.

(Get it for free now) 
Used by dozens of Zendesk clients (and counting!) 
Our add-on can save you from wasting hours of agent time every month. How? 
Well, once you’ve solved a ticket in Zendesk, more often than not your customer will send a final response just to say something like “thanks very much”, “thank you for the help” or “great job!” 
Of course it’s great to know your customer is happy with the service, but let’s be honest - it’s annoying that every time this happens, it reopens the ticket in the queue. 
One of your agents has to manually load the ticket, check the response, realise there’s no further requirement and close it. 
OK, maybe that only takes 15 or 20 seconds for each ticket - but that time soon adds up when you’re working with substantial volumes, so there’s a significant and unnecessary cost to you. 
If you reopen 5,000 Zendesk tickets per month simply because of “thank you” messages, you’re looking at about 14 hours of wasted work per month - that’s a couple of full days for one agent. 
Our solution allows you to resolve these tickets automatically. 
Our innovative Zendesk plugin works in the background and: 

Reads the message to identify key phrases that indicate a “thank you” response (we’ve tested 800+ variants) 
Confirms there’s no additional request included 
Switches the ticket back to “solved” and resolves it 
Sends a custom “thank you” message to the satisfied customer 

Take a look at the plugin in action 
 
All this happens within seconds, so there’s no backlog of “thank you” messages clogging up your queue. 
From the customer’s point of view - nothing has changed. 
From your agent’s point of view - fewer frustrating, repetitive tasks to clear. 
And from a business point of view - a better service, with lower cost. 
What about other languages? 
We automatically translate any messages or comments, so we’re able to detect and deal with “thank you” messages in virtually any language. 
Who is this plugin designed for? 
Our “thank you” plugin is an ideal solution for any business using Zendesk who deals with upwards of 1,000 customer tickets per month, and the more tickets you have, the more time and money we can save you. 
It’s completely scalable, so even the busiest service desks will be able to handle those unnecessary tickets without lifting a finger. 
Stop wasting your agents’ time and your budget replying manually to every extra “thanks” that customers send your way. 
Show them you appreciate them with a prompt automated response and move on to the next urgent issue, helping to reduce wait times. 
Is my data secure? 
Absolutely - we don’t store any of your messages or metadata long term. Once processing is complete, everything is completely erased and no logs are kept. Access is via an encrypted API key which is stored on a secured tokenization platform.",9,5,Stop wasting hours of time per month resolving Zendesk tickets because of “thank you” messages.,Free,Adelante,Stop wasting hours of time per month resolving Zendesk tickets because of “thank you” messages.,Ticketing System,1.0,mailto:tamir@adelante.co.il,https://getadelante.com/,https://www.zendesk.com/apps/support/470124/thank-you/

Self contained within Zendesk, no 3rd party system required for agents

Bubbly FREE introduces instant messaging for agents, allowing your agents to get instant answers/results from other agents. Bubbly FREE is located within the Zendesk agent portal and more tightly integrated with Zendesk than any 3rd party chat systems can provide. And it's free!
When an agent posts a chat message, all of the other agents will receive the message. If an agent doesn't have the Bubbly FREE chat panel open, they will see a notification on the Bubbly FREE icon informing them of how many new messages have arrived. When an agent is mentioned in a chat message they will receive the standard Zendesk pop-up notification displaying the message to them.
Bubbly FREE is perfect for making general announcements to all agents, for crowd sourcing answers, and for adding some light heartedness to the day (depending on your company's policy regarding fun).

 Call routing, monitoring and evaluation in one tool. With Dialog Control, you always have an overview of your service hotlines. Use Dialog Control for the decentralised distribution of calls or as an ACD system that is fully integrated into your contact centre.  
Customer Service made simple
 For this purpose we use our own development, Dialog Control. This allows your agents to work optimally at all times.
 But let’s start at the beginning. When developing Dialog Control, one of our key questions was: ""How can we develop a simple tool for our customers that meets the diverse requirements for optimum customer service?"" The result is Dialog Control from dtms, an ACD solution that is easy to use, packed with features and individually customizable.  
No wish remains unfulfilled
 Dialog Control distributes the incoming calls to queues and can be expanded to be an all-encompassing call management tool with numerous features and additional options. Our development is available for you as a solution from the cloud.  Dialog Control adapts entirely to your wishes and requirements.  
Exclusively for you - 100% made in Germany
 With Dialog Control, we can tailor the ACD solution to your business quickly, flexibly and completely in line with your requirements. And your personal account manager will assist you afterwards.  
With us, your phone numbers are in the best hands
 You can obtain your service numbers directly from us. This means you receive all modules from a single provider. If you already have service numbers or local network numbers, we can also port them. If you do not wish this, we can also redirect the numbers to Dialog Control in the cloud. As you can see, all paths lead to the optimal entry into the perfect customer dialogue.  
Clear advantages
Multiple locations - one system 

Use Dialog Control to connect any number of locations and manage the control centrally.  


No installation 

Dialog Control is browser-based. This means there is no need for complex installations.  

SIP accounts 

On request, we can provide you with SIP accounts and a fully integrated browser phone. This makes you completely independent of a local telecommunication infrastructure.  

In-house implementation - in-house support 

Dialog Control is an in-house development of dtms. Our developers are based in Germany, test on systems in Germany and use our own network. Even after the successful launch of your project, a competent contact person is still available to answer any questions or requests. Extensions or adaptations can therefore be tested and implemented quickly and flexibly. Dialog Control and dtms are 100% made in Germany.  

Numerous additional options 

Dialog Control is modular and can therefore be expanded to include numerous functions and combined with other dtms products, such as customer feedback or Peak Control (callback management).  

Flexible billing options

The Due Time app adds a 'Due time' (and 'Timezone') field to the 'Due date' field. Use triggers to define what should happen at the exact time the ticket is due.
The time is added by entering it as part of the ticket field information on the left of the screen. 
Setting a due time on a ticket:

At the point a due time hits, you can define what you want to happen to the ticket using triggers. If you need to change the priority, ticket status or any other ticket field, that's not a problem! If you want to email the assignee, assigned group or even the requestor, this is all doable.
When the due time hits, the assignee will also see an optional popup notification at the top right in Zendesk.
An example of how notifications work and how the ticket details can be set to change when a due time is reached:

The in-app 'workflows' functionality allows you to set things to happen relative to a due time. Maybe you need to be reminded 1 hour before a due time hits? No problem! 
In addition to being able to perform any ticket action at, before or after a due time, those actions can be dependent on ticket conditions. For example, if a due time hit on a ticket, 24 hours passed and the ticket was not yet solved, you could set it to escalate the ticket's priority to urgent and notify the assigned team by email telling them to take action.
Since the due time app stores the time on ticket fields in Zendesk. This allows you to create views, macros and reports using native Zendesk functionality.
Example of how you can reference a due time using a macro:

Features

Set an exact time on a ticket.
Define custom ticket actions or notifications to take place at the time.
Popup notification for assignee when the due time hits.
Workflows allow actions & notifications relative to when a due time is set.
Timezone settings so agents can select the desired zone when selecting a time.

Have you ever needed to create a ticket for something in the future, but you didn't want to create it right now because it would clog up your views and workflows? 
Introducing Future Tickets. On any ticket, in the apps pane on the right, you can select a date and time that you want your future ticket to be created. You can set a note to tell yourself why you set the ticket to be created. Finally, you can define a ticket template that presets all of the details of the future ticket, including being able to copy all of the information from the original ticket. 
Creating a ticket template is as easy as creating a Zendesk ticket. Simply, give it a name and fill out the details of the ticket. The one difference with ticket templates is that you're able to set any field to copy its contents from the original ticket that the future ticket was created from. 
So, if you ever find yourself wishing your tickets could time travel, do it in style with the Future Tickets app. 
Scheduling when a future ticket will be created:

Features

Set precisely when a follow-up ticket will automatically be created.
Set a note to tell your future self why you set the ticket to be created.

In the event of customer contact at a distance via telephone and chat, there is a need for your administrator who works in Zendesk to identify the customer with whom the administrator has contact. This solves Svensk Bankidentifikation. 
Svensk Bankidentifikation developed by TSC The Service Corporation and IDkollen, gives you the opportunity to communicate safely and securely with your customers with the help of BankID. 
The service includes its own BankID certificate, which means that your company name is displayed in the BankID app when the customer identifies himself.
For Svensk Bankidentifikation to work, you as a company must have a valid BankID certificate. By filling in the form in this link you can apply for a BankID certificate. There are restrictions on which companies can obtain a BankID certificate. Normally, an application is processed in about a week.
Usage areas
Do your customers call and want to place orders or have support matters? With the help of Svensk Bankidentifikation, your company can easily verify customers' identities remotely, eg 

Handling orders by phone or chat
Management of new passwords or help with logins 
Administration of user accounts 
Disclosure of sensitive information or personal data

How does the app work?
Svensk Bankidentifikation can be seen in the app sidebar on the right in Zendesk.
It is simple and practical to use Zendesk's new agent window “Kundsammanhang“ (Customer Context) if you want to use Svensk Bankidentifikation also on Zendesk Chat. This means that the agent works in the same window, regardless of whether it is a case via email, chat, telephone or social media.
If a customer contacts by phone or chat and a ticket is opened in Zendesk, the customer only needs to have a BankID in order for you to be able to make an identification.

The administrator asks the customer to open his BankID app
The administrator enters the customer's “personnummer” (social security number) and clicks on the “Skicka“ button
The customer identifies himself against the company using his BankID app
The result of the identification is entered in the ticket as an internal comment.

An approved identification gives the result “Successful authentication or signing“ The app reacts if it is an incorrect “personnummer“. If the customer does not respond within 3 minutes, the request will not be approved.

You can create your own custom scripts using the tools at Zingtree.com, and the Agent Scripting App makes them appear in Zendesk. Plus, you get handy reports on how your tree is being used.
You can also pass data to and from Zendesk and your script.
Video

How it Works
The Agent Scripting App appears in the Zendesk ticket sidebar, like this:

Or as a smaller one-click button, which opens a larger pop-over:

Your agents read the prompts, and follow the script. If another agent picks up the ticket, they return to the last viewed node, and can see each step taken previously by opening the History:

You also get some awesome reporting. One example:  

More Agent Scripting App Benefits:
Pause and Resume: If a ticket is reopened, the script will reappear in the same state as it was previously, with the history intact. 
Agent Feedback: Clicking the orange chat bubble lets your agents submit comments, which are automatically sent to the authors of the tree.  Your agents become a valuable part of improving your scripts.
Automatically Choose a Script based upon Brand, tags or a custom field: When a ticket is opened, the Zingtree Agent Scripting app locates a script associated with the content of a ticket.
Zendesk Tagging: Add a tag to any node using the Zingtree Edit Node tool.  When that node is opened in Zendesk, the tag gets copied to the Zendesk tags for the current ticket.
Insert Custom Fields: Any custom fields in your Zendesk ticket can be merged into your script.
Automatic Ticket Updating: Tags and custom fields in the ticket can be updated from actions in the script - either via buttons clicked in the script, or from data entry collected.
Customizable: Use a custom CSS file to override the default look and feel of your trees within Zendesk.
Valuable Reporting: Watch the step-by-step history of each agent interaction. See which Agents or which Nodes are taking the most time.
Automatic Agent Detection: The Zingtree Agent Scripting App automatically determines which agent started each session, so there's no provisioning required or customization needed for getting good agent-centric reporting. You can even insert the agent name into the script.

Deploy the latest generation of proactive, anticipatory customer service with the newly enhanced integration between Amazon Connect and Zendesk Support. This integration enables businesses to leverage sophisticated AI and machine learning services from AWS to improve contact center agent efficiency while reducing the time end-customers spend interacting with customer service.  
The Amazon Connect app can:

Embed Amazon Connect’s web-based softphone on the top bar of a Zendesk Support instance
Link callers to a Zendesk Support user profile based on

the caller’s phone number (CLI)
the caller’s user ID
custom Zendesk user fields (e.g. account number, Organisation ID, email address etc)
the caller’s ticket ID
the most recent open ticket of an identified user
templated searches for other queries supported by the Zendesk API

Automatically create a new ticket for each call, or allow an agent to manually create a new ticket or attach the call to an existing ticket. 
Attach the following to a Zendesk Support ticket

Amazon Connect contact details
Call recording with audio playback and a download link
Advanced speech analysis through Amazon Connect’s Contact Lens
Call Transcription
Customer and agent sentiment
Categories based on rules set within Contact Lens
Conversation characteristics

Pause and resume a call recording.
Enable media-less mode. This means that the embedded CCP instance will not carry any media, allowing your Zendesk Support instance to run in VDI environments, as well as reloading your Zendesk instance without interrupting a live call.  

An integrated solution from Zendesk and Amazon Connect combines advanced contact center capabilities with a sophisticated ticketing system, empowering teams with powerful tools for routing, tracking, prioritizing and solving customer service interactions. Contact centers have a centralized platform for all customer communication to boost agent productivity, maintain full visibility into support operations, and enable seamless customer communication across channels. 
 
Benefits:
Unified interface
Allow agents to take calls from a single support platform by embedding a web-based softphone directly into Zendesk Support. All customer interactions and data including caller ID and history, tickets with call data and agent assignment are stored in one place, giving agents the context they need to provide more personalized support.  
Time-saving agent tools
Link callers to existing Zendesk Support end-user profiles based on the caller’s phone number. Zendesk automatically turns calls into tickets with information on the inbound caller for easy record keeping and issue resolution. At the end of a call, the ticket is updated with additional details, including call recording and optional speech analysis using AWS Machine Learning Services.

Any categorization that you do manually today can be automated with a few clicks. You can import your historic data and create a model on a ticket field that you have previously filled in manually, or you can create a new model on your historic data to categorize on something new.
Increase conversion by identifying urgent tickets
For example, if you are an online retail company and want to identify the tickets that talk about a product so that you can answer them as fast as possible and increase conversion, you can create a model that would recognize and tag such tickets with 'urgent' using the Labelf platform, and then activate it Zendesk using this app.
Train a ticket categorizing AI based on an existing ticket field
Another example would be a customer support for a teleco which today categorizes their support tickets into five categories using a ticket field: 'phone', 'internet', 'complaints', 'invoices', 'order'. They can train an AI on the historic data for that ticket field in just minutes and then activate the AI so that categorization and distribution into different views based on this category can happen automatically.

Need to import data into Zendesk but not sure where to begin? This app makes the process easy by providing you with an intuitive visual interface through which you can view, edit, sort and filter data safely before importing a single record. The following object types can be created or updated:

Users (up to 50,000 per import)
Groups (up to 100 per import)
Organizations (up to 50,000 per import)
Tickets (up to 50,000 per import)

Ticket comments and attachments are not currently supported but the app is flexible enough to support a variety of use-cases, including:

Creating regular proactive ticket campaigns
Updating agent roles (or downgrading agents) in bulk due to seasonal staffing changes
Flagging tickets for inclusion in a business rule or report
General data imports

And much more!
Create
The first step is to create rows within the app using an interactive, editable table.

Add individual rows manually or import many rows instantly from a CSV file
Edit fields directly within the table
Receive immediate visual feedback if a field value is invalid
Add, remove and reorder columns
Select and delete rows in bulk
Export selected columns and data to a CSV file, which can then be used as an import template

Review
Once you have populated the table with your data, you can review it before starting the actual import.

Sort the table by any column
Filter the table by keyword, against one or more columns
Toggle a view which shows only invalid rows

Import
Finally, if you're satisfied that the data is complete and accurate, you can import all rows with the click of a button.
A progress indicator will guide you through the import itself. When the import has finished you can download a completion report containing all data, the newly created record IDs and status information (created, updated or failed with details where necessary). After creating users you have the option of proceeding immediately to ticket creation.
More detailed instructions are available, which include an overview of how to create CSV files for use with the app. Every purchase of the app also entitles you to premium support to help guide you through the process from start to finish.

Synap organizes all of your customer interactions in one place, so you can collaborate more effectively on managing your relationships. While CRM systems focus on closing sales, Synap brings together all of the teams who work with customers throughout their entire lifecycle. From sales through onboarding, implementation, support, and beyond. Synap helps you to work across teams, create happy customers, and grow your business.
Zendesk Integration
Synap connects to your team’s Gmail and Zendesk accounts to automatically display one unified view of your customer communications. You can see Zendesk tickets along with emails to customers from you and your teammates, all in one organized feed for each customer.
Zendesk is a powerful help desk platform for managing customer issues, but it’s not a complete picture of your team’s interactions with your customers. At many organizations, customer conversations happen outside of Zendesk - often in email. It’s too bad because those conversations, and the customer information they contain, end up locked in one person’s inbox.
However, when you use Synap to collect your team’s emails and support tickets in one place, lots of good things can happen: 
Managers, teammates, and other stakeholders can join a conversation in mid-flight, without requiring a customer or teammate to re-explain a complex issue. Customer reps can easily cover for teammates who aren’t available, confidently jumping into a conversation where their teammates left off. 
Everyone can easily find contracts and other important documents that were sent as email attachments.

Design and embed processes that guide agents through sophisticated workflows using Cloudset's unique Visible Workflow approach.
Revolutionizes the way you configure Zendesk, and agents process tickets because ticketing and business processes are made visible and interactive to agents.
Diagrammatically model your workflow processes and directly configure activity properties and transitions to implement controlled actions. The richness of modeling includes:

Multiple start points
Linear activity sequences
Multi-path activity splits and joins
Parallel activities as sub-tickets
Combining parallel and sequential activities
Decompose activities into sub-activities
Checklist tasks within activities

With the agent Workflow Assistant see where you currently are in the workflow process, what is needed to complete this activity, and in doing so, where can or does this ticket go next.
Workflow interactive conditions and actions reimagine trigger conditions to make them interactive in the agent experience and process-centric.
Workflow macros allow applying the right macro at the right time in the workflow processes. Save time in finding, ensure accuracy, and promote consistency.
Workflow enactment permissions enable you to choose the right level of locking down the workflow process, while also supporting all agent’s involvement via private comments.
The benefits of the Flowset include:

Reduction in  Agent Handling Time and agent onboarding time
Improve accuracy
Implement control and guide at the point-of-need
Reduction in configuration set-up and maintenance
Support a wide range of use, spanning trouble tickets and business tasks
Seamlessly integrate into the Zendesk UX and UI

A Cloudset Framework account is created for all new customers, providing a hub for all Cloudset purchased apps, enabling access to Zendesk Guide integration services, and billing management.

The Reminders app allows agents to set customized reminder messages for themselves and other team members at specified times. 
Creating a reminder in Zendesk:

Agents can define as many reminders as they need for each ticket. 
Reminders will work on tickets in ANY state, including 'closed'. This solves the use case where you want to get back to a customer about something in say, 6 months time, but you don't want to keep their ticket open for that long because it would muddy your views and reporting. With Reminders, you can have your cake and eat it too! Mark the ticket as solved, and get the reminder in 6 months anyway.
When a reminder hits, a popup notification will appear at the top right of the screen for all agents listed as part of the reminder. A brandable email will also be sent that contains the reminder message and a link back to the ticket. 
Receiving a reminder:

In addition to the notifications, agents can use the side-bar interface to keep track of future reminders, which ones have passed and which reminders they've marked as completed. 
The ability for agents to mark each reminder as completed (even before the reminder takes place) gives agents full control over everything they need to remember ensuring that nothing falls between the cracks. 
Keeping track of reminders:

Features

Set an unlimited number of reminders on any ticket.
Agents can include other team members in each reminder they create. 
Reminders work on tickets regardless of the ticket 'state' (including closed!).
Get popup notifications and emails when reminders hit.
Check reminders off like checklist items. 
Keep track of reminders using the sidebar interface with lists of, 'upcoming', 'recent' and 'completed' reminders.

Integrating Zendesk with systems across the software development and delivery value stream for testing, defect and issue tracking, requirements management, build and version control and operations, can dramatically speed up customer issue resolution times and align business and development teams to focus on common goals. All information related to service tickets flow bi-directionally between teams – providing end-to-end traceability in software development.
Example Integration Use Case:
Zendesk < - > Jira Software: Integrating Zendesk with Jira Software reduces collaboration barriers between development and customer service teams that otherwise lead to quality issues, delivery delays, and financial loss.The teams can communicate in real - time.All tickets from Zendesk automatically synchronize to Jira Software and all the artifacts and data associated with the tickets synchronize back to Zendesk.
Commonly synchronized artifacts
Zendesk - ticket
Jira Software - Story, defect, test case, task

Git-Zen Lite is the FREE version of the simple yet powerful Git-Zen GitHub integration application for Zendesk. Git-Zen coordinates your Zendesk tickets with your GitHub commits. When a Zendesk ticket arrives, and code needs to be changed to correct the issue, you can now easily see which files needed to be changed to correct the issue right next to the ticket. Git-Zen makes it easy to look at past tickets and see exactly what code was changed to correct the issue, in case further troubleshooting is needed in the future. Git-Zen can also keep your agents separate from your developers, so that you do not need to have Zendesk licenses for your development staff.
Easy to Use
To associate a GitHub commit, all you have to do is include the Zendesk ticket number in the comment of the commit, prefaced by ""gz#"":
this is a comment for gz#12345

Informative
See a list of related issues, files, and commits right next to the ticket. Click on a commit link to view the commit in GitHub.
Flexible
Multiple tickets can be referenced in the same commit comment. Multiple repositories can be referenced; so if a change was required to both your database schema and your web application, all of the changes will be listed together.
Affordable
Use the LITE version for free, or enjoy the full feature set for less than $20 a month (cost is per Zendesk account; Git-Zen offers an unlimited number of users with each account).
Features
Git-Zen Lite includes the following features:

Reference ticket from a GitHub commit
View files affected by a referenced commit
Unlimited ticket references
Unlimited users
File and commit lists limited to 5 items each

Link multiple existing GitHub issues to a ticket

Efficient and precise escalation of tickets to other parties and escalations. Escalator helps agents manage complex tickets by giving them an easy way to link, split or escalate tickets. It's been designed to be easy to use, while supporting a wide range of workflows, processes and business rules. 
Core Features

Easily link related tickets.
Split tickets into smaller, distinct tasks via sub-tickets.
Quickly escalate tickets to other agents, groups or even third parties.
Save time, reduce mistakes or limit access to sensitve customer data by pre-configuring escalations.
Easily include/exclude comments and attachments when escalating, so only relevant information is included on sub-tickets.
Monitor the status of linked tickets from within the app.


Escalator works by creating sub-tickets (or linking to existing tickets). This allows agents to break down complicated issues into smaller, simpler, more manageable tasks. Sub-tickets can then be assigned to other agents, groups, or third parties. 
Use sub-tickets to involve other departments within your organization, to bring in specialized knowledge or to simply help spread the workload. Create or link as many sub-tickets as needed.
Linking tickets
Effortlessly link recent viewed tickets, bookmarked tickets, search for a specific ticket or enter the ticket id.
Splitting tickets
Split (or 'fork') tickets on the fly by creating new ad hoc sub-tickets. When splitting a ticket, the agent can decide whether to copy over all ticket data, or just create an empty linked ticket. 
Escalate tickets
Escalate tickets to other agents, groups or third parties. Escalations can pre-configured, so agents can create and populate sub-tickets with just a few clicks. When esclalating a ticket, agents can easily select which comments and attachments to copy over to the new sub-ticket.
With pre-configured escalations, admins can choose which fields and ticket data is copied to the sub-ticket. Light agents or 3rd party escalations can be set as the requester, to facilitate notifications and make interaction with your team simpler. You can insert placeholders into the subject, set core fields (status, priority, ticket type, etc), custom fields and a whole lot more.

Klick-Zen allows you to add actionable buttons to your Zendesk ticket emails and responses automatically, allowing customers to update ticket properties with the click of a button. Enhance your workflow and save valuable time and resources by having customers update ticket details themselves!
Klick-Zen provides the ability to have a customer respond to a Zendesk ticket email by simply clicking a button in their email. When clicked, the button will update the ticket as needed, and direct the customer to either a generic ""thank you"" landing page, or another web-based landing page of your choosing.
Klick-Zen hosts the button images and the generic landing web page; no additional hosting is required!  
Easy to Use
Create a fully-functional button with just a few clicks - be up and running with your first button in minutes!
Add a button to your Zendesk automated email response templates, or have your agents insert a button directly into a Zendesk comment right from the Klick-Zen toolbar in the ticket editor.
Customizable
Control exactly how your button looks with features such as border, foreground, and background colors, font, and more! Each button is rendered as an image within the email for a consistent experience.
Customize the post-click landing page (hosted by Klick-Zen) to include your company colors, logo, and any message you choose.  Or direct the user to your own landing page or support site.
Create a custom subdomain for the button images and landing page for a seamless customer experience.
Powerful
When a button is clicked by a customer, actions can be taken on their ticket automatically, without the customer even having to log in to your support center.  Your button can perform actions such as:

Changing the ticket status
Adding a tag
Inserting a specific private or public comment
Updating a custom ticket field

Add multiple buttons to an email to present choices to the customer.  Add more than one action into the same button for greater functionality. Combine these actions with Zendesk triggers for an even more powerful workflow:

Automatically route tickets based on a customer responses
Respond to a customer with additional information
Have a customer confirm quickly and easily that their issue was resolved, and close the ticket

CRM for Zendesk is designed specifically to work with Zendesk Support and enable you to build and manage sales pipelines. See what you can achieve with CRM and Deals:

 Fetch sales opportunities directly from Zendesk Support tickets
  Create custom sales pipelines with multiple stages
  Create custom deal forms to collect all the necessary records
 Link deals with specific products
  Assign different statuses to CRM users
 Forecast sales over specific time periods

  Keep track of all events (actions)



Capture deals in a snap
As you’re working on a ticket and the sales opportunity shows itself, there’s no time for shuffling tabs. Click the Create deal button right in the ticket view to transfer the prospect’s name and company directly to CRM and Deals.

Build your own sales process
Customize pipelines to fit your unique sales process. Add as many sales stages to a pipeline and name them as you find necessary. You can also specify the probability of closing a deal for each stage or how long deals they stay idle in each stage before rotting (expiring).

Maintain control of each sales deal
Pipeline management is easier than ever with a simple drag-and-drop interface. And with the filtering option, you can quickly scan through the pipeline to understand where you’re standing with each deal. Use standard app filters or create custom ones. And here you can go as far as possible - filter your deals by assignee, status, or even lost reasons.

Gather all the necessary information
Add fields to deal forms that will help you gain the appropriate context on the sale. The form you will use to create a deal already has a few default fields which help capture the basic information. You’re free to add as many custom fields as necessary. We recommend keeping it simple, though.

Link deals with products
Create your company’s products and services to link them to each deal. Thus, you will get more insight into the value of each deal and a clearer understanding of how your sales work.

Build better relationships using user statuses
We bet you’ve already gathered thousands of contacts that you’ll be using in your sales process. ‘User status’ will give you a hand while trying to distinguish where each of them belongs in the customer lifecycle. There are 4 possible statuses to add: contact, lead, prospect, and customer. Distinguish between the users you have in your Zendesk and approach each in a personalized way.

Get sales forecasts
The default deal form has one handy field called the Expected closing date. With its help, you can plan your sales and get an overview of your performance. Switch to a Forecast mode to see deals you’re expecting to close each month.

Measure to improve sales
There are four types of reports you can use to analyze your performance. You can check the number of deals you got, how many opportunities you lost/ won, and the reasons why you lose deals.
On top of that, you can filter reports by:

 Time - choose a custom date range and display the results daily, weekly, or monthly;
 Pipeline - view altogether or a specific one;
 Agent - analyze the performance of all agents or a specific one
 Group - get the insights into the performance of a specific group of agents
 Currency.

The reports are downloadable, so that you can keep track of all your performance results in neatly formed CSV files on your PC.

Keep the track of all events
Get the full history of actions taken with your Deals and Lead profiles - see who and when ran a specific action and which CRM object was influenced.

Single sign on with Zendesk's Remote Authentication

When users try to login to Zendesk, we'll ping your WordPress site to see if they're already logged in, and then sign them straight into Zendesk without them needing to register or set a new password. It's 100% secure, too!
Turn your blog comments straight into Zendesk tickets, with one click**
Need to take that conversation offline, or escalate someones question or problem to someone else in the company. From the comments administration screen, you can take any comment made and turn it into a Ticket. The process is completely seamless for your users, and they'll appreciate the extra mile you're going to provide amazing customer service.
The Zendesk feedback tab**
Add a tab to any webpage so users can search your knowledge base, chat with an agent or submit a ticket. You can completely customise the look and feel. You can have it on every page on your WordPress blog, or choose where you want it with the use of a template tag.
Access your tickets from your dashboard**
Full access to your views, tickets (including custom fields) and comments. Never lose sight on your support requests, no matter where you are.
A simple contact form, on the dashboard**
Give your visitors the ability to quickly submit a question or issue with a two field contact form. You can place this on the dashboard, restricting it to only those with Zendesk accounts, or you can allow anyone to open a request regardless of a Zendesk account.

Create and share easy-to-understand dashboards that keep your team up to speed with what’s going on right now, and give the rest of the company visibility into your hard work. With Geckoboard it's easy to get eyes on the metrics that matter; connect your Zendesk account, and in seconds you'll be visualizing metrics like chat volume, missed chats, first response time and agent availability like a pro - no training or tutorials required. Once you've tailored your dashboard to focus on the things your team cares about, sharing it is easy. Copy and paste a link to your live dashboard in a message to a colleague, bookmark it for easy access, or embed it in other tools. Schedule screenshots of your dashboard to be automatically sent around your organization over email or Slack, on a schedule you choose, using our snapshots feature. We've even made it straightforward to display dashboards on a TV or large screen in your workspace, using affordable, easy-to-source hardware.
Focus on important metrics
With their heads down interacting with customers, it can be tough for agents to see how things going and make decisions about where they should spend their time. Geckoboard helps you surface important support metrics like current chat volume, chat duration, average wait time and CSAT, so your team can get a feel for what’s “normal,” decide what to focus on, and own the work without you needing to micromanage.
Prevent problems
Issues can often go unnoticed, but by using live dashboards to surface real time metrics, you and your team can see how busy things are at any given time, spot bottlenecks and prevent problems before they get out of hand. You can even bring metrics in from other tools including Zendesk Support and Talk, for a top-down, omnichannel view of what's going on across all your support channels.
Stay energized
Viewing live metrics on a dashboard is a great way to motivate your team! With their performance on show, the whole team is inspired to raise the bar and makes it easy for them celebrate their successes.
Feel valued
Customer support teams often have their hard work overlooked, and deserve more recognition than they get. Sharing your dashboards or displaying them on a large screen in your workplace is a great way to shine a light on the whole team’s contribution to the business.

""Having a top-down view gives individuals the ability to easily switch focus to where it’s needed most."" - Joey Wheeler, Director of Client Services, Autoloop
""Agents love it because they can see everything they need in one place.

It opens people's eyes to see that the team works so hard and gives visibility to the work they do throughout the organisation."" - Logan Grooms, Director of Customer Care, Maisonettep

When using CCs, you are allowing agents to copy in other users or agents when replying to ticket notifications by email. 
Similar, when you enable followers, you allow agents to receive email notifications about updates to the ticket, but their names and email addresses do not appear in email notifications to other people on the ticket. They remain invisible to external end users.
You can find more information on this core Zendesk feature via this Zendesk support article.
Even though the Follower function makes it easy for agents to stay in the loop, currently there is no way to incorporate the Follower function in views in your support interface.
Agents who want to quickly check tickets they are followers of need to navigate to their profile and filter tickets there or start looking to their mailbox. Which is not very efficient.
Follower view
This application adds a shortcut to the left navigation bar of your Support interface.
. Clicking this button opens a brand new view that gives the agent quick access to all their followed, ccd, requested or assigned tickets.
The views include status, last update date, subject and requester information.
Clicking any ticket in the view opens it in new tab in the Support interface.
You can also bulk Unfollow or remove yourselfs as a CC from all or a select set of tickets to prevent futue emails about that topic reaching you.

ViiBE for Zendesk promises the best remote diagnosis thanks to live video stream combined with AR and collaborative tools. ViiBE helps you optimise your customer experience and reduce on-site travels.
Customer pain points prior to integrating ViiBE into Zendesk:

  Voice communications are limited when detailing with technical incidents
  Customers in need of assistance have difficulties making their issues understood
  Subsequent incomplete diagnosis of the problem
  Needing several calls to establish an accurate diagnosis (low FCR)
  Long lasting customer device and machine downtime
  Expensive travels for technicians to help customers
  Too long of time to resolve incidents, leading to unsatisfied customers (low NPS)

With ViiBE, you can optimise FCR up to 25%, NPS over 30%, and reduce Tech dispatch by 20%.
What is our service?
We provide a dedicated subdomain of ViiBE to our clients. This allows them to use our video communication interface and access their dedicated back-office.
Once the ViiBE app is enabled through your Zendesk platform, simply open a ticket and a ViiBE call button will be embedded so you can immediately start making ViiBE calls.
In the communication interface, a help desk agent can send a link to the customer in need of assistance to start the call. In one click and without download, this person will have access to a ViiBE video communication with the expert. They can then use various collaborative tools to diagnose and solve the problem.
ViiBE call features:

  Superimposing one’s pointer over the video feed
  Taking high-quality pictures and drawing on them
  Sending and saving files
  Sending messages in the chat box
  Sharing one’s screen
  Choosing to analyse the scene via the front or the back camera

When the communication ends, both the call center agent and customer are asked to give their opinions about the quality of the call. This exit ticket helps track KPIs such as NPS, FCR, and customer satisfaction.
Each call creates a new ticket which is accessible in the back-office. The statistics for the tickets are available on a dashboard which is accessible for call center management.",18,5,ViiBE is a video-assistance and ticketing webapp designed for help desk support,Free,ViiBE Communication,ViiBE is a video-assistance and ticketing webapp designed for help desk support,Ticketing System,1.0,mailto:contact@viibe.co,https://viibe.co/,https://www.zendesk.com/apps/support/242806/viibe-for-support/

Quick access to all views via a tree-like hierarchical list.
Integrated search, with easy access to recent searches and the ability to save searches to re-use later.
Enhanced ticket previews. Get more information quicker, without having to open tickets.
Advanced ticket merging interface that gives you more control over how ticket data is merged.
Improved bulk ticket editing dialog, with support for macros.
More control over view results. Customize how many tickets are displayed on each page and use additional fields for sorting.

Lovely Views is the feature packed alternative to standard Zendesk views. If you've got a lot of ticket views to manage or have ever felt limited by standard views, then you've come to the right place. 
The standard views list in Zendesk only shows an agent a max of 20 views. To see the rest, agents need to click on ""More"" and are taken away from the views interface. This is inefficient and can really slow agents down if they regularly switch between more than a few views. Lovely Views changes this by displaying all available views in a single, easy to use panel. Lovely Views allows you to categorize your views into hierarchical tree-like folders, which reduces clutter and makes it easier for your agents to quickly access the views they require.
Lovely Views also comes with integrated search. Agents can perform searches directly within the app, with the results presented in the same familiar way as views. Unlike the Zendesk's standard search, Lovely Views keeps track of recent searches and allows you to save them for re-use later. This makes it simple to execute advanced search queries without having to re-type them over and over.
Lovely Views now comes with enhanced ticket previews, which are enabled by default. When hovering over a ticket, you'll be able to see more detail about a ticket, including the full list of comments, the date the ticket was created/last updated, and any groups, channel, or tags associated with the ticket. As well, many fields are also clickable. This allows you to quickly load similar tickets and/or related information.
The ticket merging interface in Lovely Views PLUS has been improved to give you more clarity and control over the process. Merge tickets in the standard Zendesk manner or use the custom merge feature to fine tune how the merged ticket data is combined into a new ticket. We’ve also added an option that allows you to prevent agents from merging tickets that are not all from the same requester.
Lovely Views also features an improved bulk editing interface.
This is only the tip of the iceberg. Lovely Views provides dozens of other improvements and time-savers that over time, can result in big productivity gains. Read more at Lovely Views's home page. 
Differences between Lovely Views PLUS, Lovely Views Classic (v1) and the built-in views interface are on this page.

ticketflip.ai is a Zendesk plugin that automates customer support operations by assigning support tickets to the person best equipped to deal with each issue.
Using it gives you a performance preview based on historical data of resolved tickets and considering a threshold you adjust.

Save time, money and customers. Shorten response and resolution time with the help of AI-based routing.
Choose the threshold setup that works best for your company. Minimize the number of unassigned tickets or assignment mismatch.
How it works?
Incoming support tickets are analysed in the near real-time. Using historical tickets AI model calculates the probability of domain expertise for every support agent and new tickets get assigned to the best agent based on chosen configuration settings.

If there is any ambiguity, proficient translators perform human translation at your agent's request. 

It is easier to understand the meaning of a client's request than to write a beautifully detailed response using simple machine translation. This is where human translation, performed by native multilingual speakers, comes to the rescue.

Tu scrivi via Zendesk Support e un collega risponderà direttamente da Microsoft Teams. L’intera conversazione verrà tracciata tramite note interne nel ticket selezionato.

Come fare?
1. Scarica l’app Simple MS Teams
2. Configurala su Zendesk Support ed effettua il login al tuo account personale Microsoft Teams
3. Gestisci i tuoi ticket comunicando con i colleghi che non hanno Zendesk e chiedendo loro informazioni riguardanti il ticket che stai risolvendo.
Per poter utilizzare l'app occorre sottoscrivere un apposito abbonamento a Be-Simple.
Per informazioni sul funzionamento del canone mensile scrivi a sales@be-simple.it
Per maggiori dettagli sulle modalità di configurazione e istallazione consulta questo articolo. 
Funzionalità
Grazie a Simple MS Teams potrai:
• Visualizzare, direttamente su Zendesk Support, sul lato destro, tutti i Canali Teams ai quali appartieni 

• @Menzionare un Canale oppure una/più persone presenti in esso

Una volta selezionato il Canale, composto il messaggio (con eventuale @menzione) e cliccato sul bottone “New conversation” viene creata in automatico una nuova conversazione su Microsoft Teams.
L’utente menzionato riceve una notifica automatica su Teams che gli indica la nuova conversazione avviata tramite Zendesk Support (perché questo avvenga, l’utente in questione deve avere attivato le notifiche sul proprio Teams).
Ogni volta che un operatore: 
• scrive da Zendesk tramite Simple MS Teams (operatore che utilizza Zendesk Support)
• risponde da Microsoft Teams (operatore che NON utilizza Zendesk Support, ma utilizza MS Teams)
viene creata una nota interna che riporta il contenuto del messaggio all’interno del ticket selezionato. 
Nel ticket vengono tracciati, inoltre, tutti i messaggi che vengono scambiati tra gli utenti presenti in quella stessa conversazione.
Se il ticket è in stato “chiuso”, eventuali altri messaggi all’interno della conversazione non verranno riportati all’interno dello stesso.

Users are able to select a ticket view and select tickets to be deleted/updated, or delete/update all tickets in the selected view. For Suspended tickets, users are able to filter the tickets by ticket's cause of suspension.
Manage Your Suspended Tickets
Zendesk only allows users to delete tickets by selecting up to 100 tickets at time. This could be time-consuming for Zendesk instance with high ticket volumes - including those receiving hundreds or thousands emails in the Suspended ticket views. It is not easy going through the suspended tickets and select the ones to recover vs pure spam emails that we want to delete.
Complying with Privacy and Data Protection Law
If you have obligations to comply with Privacy and Data Protection law (e.g. GDPR), this app could be useful. Often times you are required to permanently delete certain tickets. With this app, you can tag tickets that you'd like to delete and show them in either a public or private view. At the end of the day (or whenever you decide), you could use this app to delete all tickets in the view that you created.
Mass Update Ticket Status
Update ticket status in bulk. You can update ticket status to Open, Pending, On-hold (if it's enabled), Solved, and Closed. Please note that Closed tickets can't be updated/edited - this is Zendesk default behaviour. Please be cautious of your existing triggers when updating ticket status.
Features
 - Users can select ticket view from the view dropdown. Public and private views will be visible. - Refresh button is available to show the latest list of tickets - This app has been optimized to mass delete tickets in the most effective way possible. Deleting 100 tickets would take around 10 seconds while deleting 10,000 tickets could take up to five minutes. In any case, users can leave the page and the deletion process will keep running in the background
Archived Tickets
Unfortunately, this app doesn't work with archived tickets. Archived tickets are not accessible through Zendesk API.

Send envelopes directly and collect electronic signatures in a few minutes with this integration.
To enable this integration you must have an Docusign account.
Docusign is a platform that allows the preparation, sending, management and signing of documents digitally, with the guarantee of their legal validity.
When integrated with Zendesk Support, through the eZSign app, you can send envelopes directly from the ticket in your Zendesk account by uploading documents you have (no prior configuration on Docusign is required) or using templates. Templates fields can be automatically filled with data saved in the ticket.
Key features/characteristics of the Docusign integration for Zendesk:

Send envelopes directly from Zendesk: send documents for electronic signature directly from your Zendesk account. It is not necessary to interrupt the workflow for access to Docusign and submission through the platform.
Take advantage of templates already set up in Docusign: use the templates that you already have set up on Docusign for direct submission by Zendesk. Previous creation or adaptation of templates on the Docusign platform is required. 
Automatically fill data into documents with Zendesk data: create custom documents using the option to create Docusign templates and ticket details.
Speed up sending envelopes by uploading documents: send envelopes from uploading documents. Little or no configuration is required on the document.
Use multiple subscription types: according to your Docusign account permissions, subscription types will be available for selection in the application (such as ICP-Brasil, DS EU Advanced and GlobalSign).
Insert initials in documents: even with the less personalized option of sending envelopes, it is possible to use initials.
Add contacts automatically: Contacts involved in the context can be added as subscribers with just one click. 
Track the status of documents: through the app it is possible to track the status of the sent envelopes: stand-by, completed, etc. The registration of the sent envelopes is available in the app inside the ticket used to send that envelope, ristering the shipments by ticket, as soon as the ticket is updated.

Build a video library with elaborate tutorials;
Measure the performance for a specific video, or for a group of videos;

Video Reply for Zendesk will be of your assistance as an out-of-the-box tool for adding a personal touch to your customer support.

Humans are mostly visual creatures, so video tutorials are best for info comprehension. Video Reply allows you to demonstrate, illustrate, present, and explain things more effectively, and also saves time answering FAQs.

Let the customers show their issue the better way
Video demonstration is usually more effective than even a one-on-one conversation. That’s why it’s worth sending a request to customers to ask for a screen recording.

Create your Zendesk video library
All the videos you record are automatically saved into the library. Afterwards, you can just attach the necessary clip from the library to any ticket without having to record the same thing every time.

Measure the performance of your videos
Video Reply for Zendesk provides detailed reports to analyze how well your videos work. Check the performance of a specific video or the overall stats for your content to see what could be improved.

Organize your videos using tags
Use tags to sort your content and make it easy to use and share. Note that the app does not auto-tag videos.

Send a specific colleague the ticket you are currently working on;
The agent is able to include an internal comment in the ticket your sending;
The optional internal comment is always accompanied with an log of the campfire participants;
Choose whether the app pushes the ticket to open instantly, or whether the reciepient has the option to be notified and open or dismiss the request.

Use Case

No more sending links regarding specific tickets;
No broadcasting, only involve the one person you need;
Instead of mention, it is direct and makes it easy to get others involved for a (quick)question and doesn't put the recipient in the cc;

Examples
Less messing around with messengers, shouting colleagues and no logs of colleagues working together. Logging this can point out the need for more guidance, different skill levels, user rights or inefficienties in processes.

You can also pass data to and from Zendesk and your script.

How it Works
The Agent Scripting App appears in Zendesk, like this:

Click the Open Script button, and an interactive decision tree script appears, like this:

Your agents read the prompts, and follow the script. If another agent picks up the ticket, they return to the last viewed node, and can see each step taken previously by opening the History:

You also get some awesome reporting. One example:  

More Agent Scripting Benefits:
Pause and Resume: If a ticket is reopened, the script will reappear in the same state as it was previously, with the history intact. 
 Agent Feedback: Clicking the orange chat bubble lets your agents submit comments, which are automatically sent to the authors of the tree.  Your agents become a valuable part of improving your scripts.
 Automatically Choose a Script based upon Brand, tags or a custom field: When a ticket is opened, the Zingtree Agent Scripting app locates a script associated with the content of a ticket.
  Zendesk Tagging: Add a tag to any node using the Zingtree Edit Node tool.  When that node is opened in Zendesk, the tag gets copied to the Zendesk tags for the current ticket.
Insert Custom Fields: Any custom fields in your Zendesk ticket can be merged into your script.
 Automatic Ticket Updating: Tags and custom fields in the ticket can be updated from actions in the script - either via buttons clicked in the script, or from data entry collected.
 Customizable: Use a custom CSS file to override the default look and feel of your trees within Zendesk.
Valuable Reporting: Watch the step-by-step history of each agent interaction. See which Agents or which Nodes are taking the most time.
 Automatic Agent Detection: The Zingtree Agent Scripting App automatically determines which agent started each session, so there's no provisioning required or customization needed for getting good agent-centric reporting. You can even insert the agent name into the script.

The widget configurator generates Zendesk Widget configuration code based on the Web Widget API.
This tool allows you to change colors, text and buttons. You can show or hide specific interface elements, fill in form fields, translate the interface or rebrand the widget to match your brand and style. 
Also available as a standalone purchase via https://widget.guide
Check out our YouTube demo
Supported channels.
You can find a full list of supported changes on widget.guide. We support

Color, location
Change labels and button text
Prefilling form fields
Hide Channels
Filter Guide search to specific categories or sections
Show or hide Chat, Talk, Answer Bot, Guide, Support
Translate the widget


How to use the tool

Enter your Zendesk domain to start
Use the wizard to change button text, colors, position
You can make changes to any Zendesk channel, or hide a channel completely if you want to offer a different experience to the customer.
When you're happy about your setup, you can get the necessary code to embed the custom widget on your website.

Use case examples

Change the button text from Support to Contact on Sales pages.
Show both Chat, Talk and Contact Form buttons when a user clicks 'contact us'.
Hide the Guide Search function when loading the widget on an FAQ page.
Offer Chat on a sales page, but hide it on the support page.
Translate the widget dynamically based on the language of the page loaded.
Nudge the widget a bit to the left so it doesn't overlap with a 'back to top' page.
Show Answer Bot on your homepage, but a classic contact form on the Support pages.

How does it work
The Widget uses the Zendesk widget API to generate the code. Every option available there is configurable, but instead of writing code, you can play around in a wizard and see what happens.
Since we still use the official API the tool is compatible with any future changes Zendesk will make.

With  Email Tracking, you’ll never have to ask that question again. Besides, with the metrics the app provides at hand, you can easily see which clients are active email users and what fuels their engagement.
Email Tracking is an application for Zendesk Support that offers an out-of-the-box function of tracking the exact time each email was opened.
With the app, you can:

Track the delivery of sent emails
View internal notes with accurate information on when the email was opened
Get automated updates of internal custom fields when the client opens the email or you get a reply
Add ‘unseen’ and ‘seen’ tags to tickets to create separate views for identifying problem tickets
Analyze email performance with detailed and downloadable reports


Enjoy automated email tracking
Email Tracking does all the job for you! After you set up the application, just sit back, and analyze the data. See who you should give a call to prevent any issues or identify solid leads for your further follow-ups. Moreover, the tracking is available even directly from each Agent Workspace!
Additional ticket organization
Email Tracking creates a custom field and a tag with ‘seen’ and ‘unseen’ values. As a result, you can simply create separate views for read and unread tickets and build business rules (triggers and automations) around seen and unseen tickets to work with your customers’ information more accurately. Moreover, the app displays Seen/Unseen columns in the Ticket Views you pick yourself. Everything made so that you don’t even have to enter the ticket to know if it’s been seen or not!

Real-time notifications
As soon as an email is opened, Email Tracking updates a custom field connected to the ticket and adds a note with corresponding information. With push notifications enabled, you’ll be informed the second your email was opened.
Analyze performance in detail
Get a better understanding of how your replies perform with accurate performance reports. See what macros work better, what types of email users react to the most, and check the overall bounce and open rates across the company, one or several agents at a time. The reports are downloadable, so that you can keep the data in a CSV file on your PC.

See full history of email opens
With Email Tracking, you are able to retain and see the whole ticket opens history, as the plugin tracks each time your emails were opened by the recipient. Follow the way how, when, and after which message the ticket was opened. The sidebar also shows if the ticket was read via desktop of mobile device, so it's even easier to optimize the messages now.

Send replies at the best times
Based on the open and reply rates, the plugin will suggest the best time for your agents to reach out to the customer directly in the ticket menu. Thus, you’ll be able to react to customer inquiries exactly when they need it the most.
Comply with GDPR and CCPA
Click a single toggle and Email Tracking will not track email opens for recipients who live in the European Union or California. Make sure that your email sales and support activities are GDPR compliant without having to put in any effort.

Private data security
We don’t retain any data connected to your agents and customers, except:

Your Zendesk subdomain, and its URL
Agents IDs and their authorization tokens
Agents IPs to exclude their open events
Tracked Ticket ID
Custom field IDs required for this add-on

Stay under cover
If you’re worried about how you can know for a fact that all opens are tracked correctly, you should not. When you log into your agent panel and start working with tickets, we automatically hide your IP address. You can also add more IP addresses to the blacklist so that you get 100% accurate tracking.
One-click install
Provide Email Tracking with the access to your Zendesk account in just one click without filling out any additional forms. We use Zendesk OAuth  authorization which is the most secure way to connect.
Transparent and Flat fee
Simple and clear price with no hidden additional obligations, payments, long-term agreements, or other tricks. There is also a free trial for you to test the app before paying anything. Subscribe and cancel anytime. 
You can also limit the number of agents using the application. Purchase the subscription only for those agents who require the apps functionality for everyday work. Find more details in the 'How to install' tab. 
Email Tracking is available both in desktop and mobile versions. Go ahead and test the app!

When an agent applies a Lightning Macro to a ticket, they’re automatically prompted with a form that enables them to quickly customize only the parts of the macro you specify (see screenshots).
By using the tab key, they can quickly complete the form without ever using their mouse. Add validation logic to your fields to eliminate errors!
See 'How to Install' for your 14 day free trial. For more information visit: http://www.lightningmacros.com

Example
Let's say you’ve created a macro to quickly respond to your customers that have received their order later than promised. Most of the text in your macro is standardized but you need to customize their name, the discount you’re providing them and the refund amount they should expect on their credit card statement.
Hi [INSERT CUSTOMER NAME HERE],
We’re so sorry you received your Acme Sprocket later than we promised. To make this right, we’re going to give you a [INSERT DISCOUNT AMOUNT HERE]% discount. You should see a refund on your bank statement for [INSERT REFUND AMOUNT HERE] in 3-5 business days.
[INSERT SOME PERSONALIZED TEXT HERE]
Sincerely,
{{current_user.name}}
While this works, it is less than ideal for two primary reasons:
Speed. To add customized text, the agent must drag their mouse over the parts they would like to change.  In just this simple example, the agent must move their mouse, drag over text, and then type up to 6 times. This is extremely time consuming.
Accuracy. The customized text isn’t validated, so it’s too easy for your agents to accidentally add something like “we’re going to give you a 1000% discount.” Using macros this way is error-prone!
Wouldn’t it be great if your agents could easily add customized text without moving their mouse at all? And wouldn’t it be super sweet if macros validated custom text, preventing confusing and embarrassing typos? We agree—that’s why we created Lightning Macros.
With just a few tweaks to your existing macros, whenever an agent applies a macro, they’re immediately prompted with a validated entry form that they can complete quickly by pressing the tab key.

There are many methodologies to calculate sentiment scores but overall, the science is based on algorithms of natural language processing as well as machine learning to categorize pieces of words as positive, neutral, or negative.
This app is using AFINN lexicon. Thanks to Finn Årup Nielsen for compiling list of 3,300+ words with polarity score associated with each word. When a ticket requester says the word ""happy"" for example, this adds 3 points to the score. At the same time, if the customer says the word ""does not work"", this deducts 3 points to the overall score. You can see the complete list of words on this page
What are the limitations of this app?
This app currently only works with English. There are plans to incorporate other languages at future date (Please let us know! We'd love to hear your feedback).

IMPORTANT: Git-Zen for GitLab is designed to work with GitLab.com, and  will not function with self-hosted instances of GitLab.
Git-Zen is a simple yet powerful GitLab integration application for Zendesk. Git-Zen coordinates your Zendesk tickets with your GitLab commits and issues. When a Zendesk ticket arrives, and code needs to be changed to correct the issue, you can now easily see which files needed to be changed to correct the issue right next to the ticket. Git-Zen makes it easy to look at past tickets and see exactly what code was changed to correct the issue, in case further troubleshooting is needed in the future. Git-Zen can also keep your agents separate from your developers, so that you do not need to have Zendesk licenses for your development staff; simply create a new GitLab issue related to the Zendesk ticket directly from within Zendesk.
Easy to Use
To associate a GitLab commit, all you have to do is include the Zendesk ticket number in the issue description or comment of the commit, prefaced by ""gz#"":
this is a comment for gz#12345

Functional
See a list of related issues, files, and commits right next to the ticket. Click on a commit link to view the commit in GitLab. Create a new GitLab issue, link an existing GitLab issue, and comment on a GitLab issue right from within the Zendesk ticket.
Flexible
Multiple tickets can be referenced in the same commit comment or issue. Multiple repositories can be referenced; so if a change was required to both your database schema and your web application, all of the changes will be listed together.
Affordable
Enjoy the full feature set for less than $20 a month (cost is per Zendesk domain account; Git-Zen offers an unlimited number of users with each account).
Free Trial Available
Contact us at support@git-zen for more information.
Features
Git-Zen includes the following features:

View files affected by a referenced commit

Edits are continuously auto-saved

Where does an agent keep important information about a ticket? Information that needs to be highly visible and referred to later by the agent that wrote it or by other agents. Information that may also need to be updated throughout the life of the ticket.
Agents will try to use an “internal note” for this purpose. But once it has been submitted, an internal note is no longer editable and can quickly become buried in long ticket threads.
The Sticky Notes app provides the visibility and flexibility needed to properly highlight important information in a ticket/user/org for internal purposes. 
The Pinned Comments feature allows agents to pin important ticket comments so they are not lost in long ticket threads. Any comment can be pinned, whether it be from a customer or agent.
The Notes feature allows agents to write important notes in the sidebar of the ticket/user/org so they are always clearly visible to all agents. The notes can also be updated at any time by the agent. 
Editing notes is done with a Rich Text Editor (WYSIWYG) and can be edited in-place in the right sidebar or in a much larger pop-up editor, which is handy for longer documents. The editor allows formatted text to be pasted into the note with the formatting maintained, including hyperlinks (web links).
As editing is taking place, the app continuously saves a draft, so that edits are not lost.
The notes are stored in a custom field so that the data stays connected with the ticket/user/org. This means it can be used by other apps and exported with the ticket/user/org data into other systems. All Zendesk field types are supported: Drop-down, text, multi-line, checkbox, numeric, decimal, date, credit card and regular expression. To help your agents use the Sticky Notes fields that you setup, descriptions can be added that appear next to the fields.
Multiple fields can be used to store notes. This allows notes with difference purposes to be separated. For example, you might have one field for general notes and another field for notes regarding a specific component of your help desk process (eg. sales or refunds). Using multiple fields, the Zendesk administrators have great control over which fields appear in which ticket forms and which agent groups have access to them. 
All of the fields you create in Sticky Notes can be styled to your liking using CSS. This means that you can make certain fields standout or be less intrusive, depending on their importance and the type of data. 
For more information about the Sticky Notes app, including how and why you would use multiple fields for notes, see the Sticky Notes User Guide.

Already supporting the world's largest and most successful Agile and DevOps transformations, Tasktop enables enterprises to scale deployments to hundreds of projects, tens of thousands of users and millions of artifacts – without writing a single line of code. 
Key unique benefits include: 

Automates the flow of information across the value stream. 
Enables the frictionless flow of artifacts (such as defects, user stories, trouble tickets), as well as information from events (such as build failures, version control changesets, security scan vulnerabilities and performance monitoring alerts), across the tools and stakeholders in the software development value stream. This removes non-value added work and bottlenecks; increases velocity and capacity; enhances collaboration; enables automated traceability and even improves employee satisfaction. 
Enables visibility into the value stream. 
When managers want to see metrics and dashboards to understand project status, to optimize the process or to ensure compliance, it has been nearly impossible to get a real-time, holistic view across unintegrated tools. Tasktop unlocks lifecycle data from these application tool silos by automatically compiling lifecycle activity data into a single database. This data can be used to create consolidated, full-lifecycle reports and dashboards, as well as for traceability reporting.

Your customers can provide feedback about their support experience by rating their solved tickets. When you enable CSAT (customer satisfaction ratings), end-users receive an email 24 hours after the ticket has been set to solved that asks them to briefly evaluate their experience.
Agent Experience
Your agents can only see feedback for tickets in Explore or when opening a ticket that has gotten feedback.
In other words, they need to actively go look for feedback.
But what happens when a customer that has recently left feedback creates a new ticket? What if that customers was extremely unsatisfied in the last ticket. Or he is generally a happy customer, but had one or two bad experiences with similar requests. Wouldn't you want to know?
Introducing Satisfaction Score
The Satisfaction Score app shows a customer's satisfaction score right next to an open ticket. It calculates a percentage based on all feedback given (or optionally recent feedback of the last month) and lists the 5 most recent tickets with a clear good/bad indicator.
This way your agents can immediately see how this customer experienced your customer care in the past and maybe adjust their response accordingly.
If your agents need more info they can open any recent ticket with a single click in a new tab.

This app requires Zendesk Support Professional, Enterprise or Elite due to its dependency on the Satisfaction feature.

Halp allows you to seamlessly integrate Zendesk tickets with Slack to enable IT and other internal ops teams to supercharge everyday workflows between their two favorite tools. We help hundreds of innovative companies improve response times and collaboration including Adobe, Slack, and Home Depot. 
Slack messages can be transformed into Zendesk tickets to manage and measure internal employee requests or shared channels with customers. Zendesk tickets can be sent into Slack channels to automate escalations and increase company-wide collaboration on issues. 
Zendesk tickets are two-way synced with a thread in Slack. Messages in the thread automatically create responses to the Zendesk ticket, allowing coworkers or customers to respond in a familiar chat-based environment while keeping everything organized and tracked. 
Responses from Zendesk are automatically posted into a thread on the corresponding ticket in Slack. Users can also assign, tag, prioritize, edit custom fields, and respond to the ticket inside Slack. See it in action: Demo Video
For IT Teams Handling Employee Requests

Turn direct messages in Slack into Zendesk tickets, or allow employees to create tickets using a slash command and ticket form for categorization. 
Responses and updates to the ticket from Zendesk post back to the employee via the thread in Slack. 
Employees can respond via Slack without switching context. 

For Managing Customers in Slack

Provide high touch customer support in Slack channels while ensuring everything is tracked via Zendesk. 
Customers' Slack messages can be easily turned into Zendesk tickets with an emoji or slash command. 
Customers will see responses to tickets from inside Slack, agents can edit and assignee tickets in Slack.

Viewabo provides a service that allows customer support agents to request access to smartphone cameras so that customers can send live-streamed video of issues without using an app, making it faster for agents to understand and resolve customer issues. Trying to understand and resolve difficult customer issues in email, chat, or over the phone is often frustrating for everyone. Not only could it take a long time to figure out what the issue is, but also the issue might not get resolved if agents can't see if customers are fixing it correctly.
Why Use Viewabo?
Reduce Customer Frustration
Customers want their issues resolved as fast as possible. By the time customers contact you, they are already frustrated. The longer it takes you to resolve their issue, the more frustrated the customer becomes.
Reduce Resolution Time
Half the time it's just figuring out what the issue is in the first place. The faster you can figure out what's wrong, the faster you can resolve the issue. This provides you with more time to help more customers.
Reduce Lost Business
Acquiring new customers is more expensive than keeping existing ones. Taking too long to resolve customer issues, or not resolving them at all, runs the risk of you losing that customer permanently.
How It Works:

Send your customer a link from inside your Zendesk Support help desk.
Your customer clicks to allow access to their rear-facing smartphone camera.
Live video appears on your screen. Now you can see what your customer sees.
Annotate, pause, or rotate the video stream to solve the problem faster.

OMQ Assist
OMQ Assist enhances your ticket system with a self-learning knowledge base, which automatically suggests suitable solutions. The processing time of each individual ticket is reduced, because of the extremely shortened research process. As soon as a ticket or a customer email is opened in Zendesk, OMQ Assist reads the message automatically. The Artificial Intelligence of OMQ understands the customer’s request and OMQ Assist proposes matching entries from the knowledge base. These appear in the right pane of Zendesk Support.
You can also individually search for an answer if you want to use a different answer than the one suggested by OMQ Assist. Just enter a search term in the search field. OMQ Assist displays all entries for this search term. The number in the first place indicates how many entries for the term are stored in the knowledge base as a whole. Below is listed which specific entries there are related to the term and how many of them exist.
About OMQ
OMQ is a central and intelligent knowledge base. All OMQ products access the same service answers from the knowledge base and direct them into the various communication channels.

With our artificial intelligence, incoming customer messages will be automatically read. Simultaneously, OMQ Assist analyzes and understands the intention of the customer request.

Chatlayer.ai is an easy to use conversational AI platform that lets you build and maintain large bots, no coding required. Our Natural Language Processing algorithms can understand more than 100 languages out of the box, even if you only trained your bot in just 1 language. 
How do Zendesk Chat and Chatlayer.ai connect?
This integration connects your Chatlayer.ai bot directly to Zendesk Chat. Chatlayer.ai bots are often used to answer repetitive questions, or to collect data that's required for an agent to help customers faster. As soon as the bot has done it's thing, the conversation will be seamlessly handed over to a Zendesk Chat agent, allowing them to pick up where the bot left off. The Zendesk Chat agent can see the history of the conversation between the bot and the customer, and the customer overview is pre-filled with data gathered in the bot. 
The Zendesk Chat integration with Chatlayer.ai is only available for companies on the Zendesk Chat Enterprise plan.

The integration with Zendesk allows the agent to launch a session straight from Zendesk. Session data is then reported back to Zendesk for future reference. 
VeriShow allows the following flows: 
Agent who speaks with a customer over the phone can start a session and invite a customer to join them to an online meeting. This is where the agent can share documents or co-browse the site together with the customer. Invitations can be sent via link, email and SMS. 
The other flow allows the agent who speaks with the customer over the phone to read out a unique Assistance ID that is displayed on the company's website. When the agent enters that ID into the Assistance ID field of VeriShow in Zendesk, it connects the two parties in a session. The agent is then able to share content and co-browse. 
VeriShow's Secure, Patented Co-browser features 

Continue to co-browse from current session – continue to co-browse with customer from existing page, without losing previously saved data, added cart items, completed registration steps etc. 
Co-browse pages that are behind login– no need to log in again if customer is already logged in, and be able to co-browse pages that are behind login. 
Compatible with cookies – all cookie-based info is maintained and visible on both sides when co-browsing (e.g. adding items to shopping carts, changing language preference). 
Full (optional) agent/customer control – choose view-only mode or agent control within the co-browsing session (limiting certain actions only is also supported). 
Cursor and scrolling synchronization – The website’s representative and customer mouse cursors are visible and scrolling of pages is synchronized and can be done by both participants in the session. 
Form completion – actively assist the customer while he or she is completing a form and even help with completion and type in forms (optional, agent view-only mode available). 
Highlighting – assist the user by clicking on particular areas with the cursor highlighting feature. 
Masking of sensitive fields while co-browsing – in scenarios such as payment pages, it is possible to mask inputted customer info such as credit card details. 

VeriShow's Main Content Sharing 

Agent to customer content sharing - share images, PDFs, Office documents in real-time with the customer. 
Customer to agent content sharing - share content as above with the agent 
Form completion - complete forms together with the customer in real-time 
Screen Sharing - agent to customer desktop, window or application sharing in real-time. 

Reporting

This app lets you perform ""down to the minute"" actions relative to any event on a ticket. So if you've been needing a warning 10 minutes before a Service Level Agreement is breached, this is the app you've been looking for!
You simply define the length of your timer, set when it applies and define what happens when it hits. 
Example of a timer hitting:

As shown above, when a timer hits, a tag gets added to the ticket, this allows you to create a Zendesk trigger that checks for that tag and performs any action as a result. You might want to send yourself (or your team) an email or Slack message, you may want to place it in a particular Zendesk view, or combine it with our Notify app to show popup notifications inside of Zendesk. 
But, this is not just limited to only use cases where SLAs are involved. The app can be used as a better alternative to Zendesk's native automations, since they're only accurate down to the hour, any other use case requiring minute by minute accuracy can also be addressed by this app.
Features

Unlimited ""down to the minute"" timers. 
Set timers relative to any point of a ticket's life cycle.
Define a tag to be added to a ticket when a timer hits.

By bringing concepts from the software development world, Salto empowers business applications’ operators to automate and streamline the way they plan, build, deliver, track, debug and document configuration changes across their application stack.
To that end, Salto built a platform that translates the applications’ configurations into human readable code - giving their operators increased observability and control, saving them time, errors and agony. This helps you understand how changes in configurations affect your company’s entire integrated application suite, so you can later plan and deploy those changes with confidence, as well as audit them, and identify and address the root cause of issues.
With its Zendesk support, Salto enables you to create deep visibility into your Zendesk configuration, search it, version control it in Git, understand the impact of your configuration changes (within Zendesk and across other business applications like Salesforce, NetSuite, Jira and Workato) and even enables compliance requirements when dealing with Zendesk configuration changes.

Link related issues and inform backlog priority 
Intalayer integrates seamlessly with Zendesk and Jira. Using Intalayer's machine learning algorithms, Support agents can quickly identify whether their current customer conversation in Zendesk matches tickets already in your Product team's Jira backlog. New conversations and existing tickets can be linked together, helping Support and Product see an accurate volume count of related issues and inform backlog priority. 
Transfer all the data your engineers need, in seconds 
Support agents can save hours every week by linking or creating Jira tickets from within Zendesk. Any customer conversations, comments and attachments that your engineers need are instantly transferred to Jira and added to a linked ticket or used to automatically create a new ticket. This saves Support agents a huge amount of time copying and pasting text, downloading and re-uploading huge file attachments like session recordings and screenshots. 
Advocate for customers and influence Product decisions 
With Intalayer, Support leaders can now advocate for customer needs with an objective, data driven approach and add value to product prioritisation meetings. Intalayer provides Support leaders with daily updates highlighting the highest priority issues for customers and your business.

Linker saves agent time while streamlining your escalation flows, especially when you begin using new messaging via persistent channels. 
In our experience, 50% of client conversations with customers cover multiple topics. For better visibility and escalation, you need a way to separate different subjects into distinct flows. 
Manually creating new sub-tickets while chatting with a customer can be cumbersome, but with Linker, this is not a problem. Linker makes sub-ticket creation effortless, as it allows one to create child tickets with a single click. 
Main features

Create sub-tickets with one click. 
Track linked tickets status from the parent ticket. 
Create and configure child ticket templates for every situation.

Whether through your Customer Relationship Management, Enterprise Resource Planning, Accounting, Billing, or Support tools, customer data must be available and actionable to ensure a seamless omnichannel experience.
With Recurly for Zendesk, you don’t have to switch to separate tabs or systems to view or change the subscription details of your customers. Your omnichannel view provides you a complete picture of each subscriber--what level subscriber, for how long, and how valuable--plus, Recurly for Zendesk gives you the power to pause, cancel, or refund your customers’ subscription without leaving the Zendesk interface.
If a subscriber is at risk of churning, the ability to pause their service is a great way to take a break from the subscription without canceling and losing their billing data, preferences, etc. It’s never ideal to have a subscriber cancel, but it’s a great learning opportunity to improve your retention strategy. If a subscriber requests to cancel their subscription, agents can do so immediately in the Zendesk interface, at the subscriber’s next bill date or at the end of the subscription term.
With Recurly for Zendesk, you’ll save time, optimize your revenue, and provide great service to your customers.

Puzzel is a cloud-based Customer Service Platform used by 1000+ businesses to manage their customer interactions and support their busy teams.
Why choose Puzzel + Zendesk
Handle inbound and outbound calls
Puzzel's integration for Zendesk enables support agents to handle all inbound and outbound calls from within the Zendesk platform. This eliminates the need for agents to switch between windows and applications while on the phone with customers. Calls can go through landlines, mobile phones or softphone, with outbound calls able to be made simply by typing a phone number. Reporting is available for both inbound and outbound calls.  
Automatically create tickets
Whenever an agent receives an inbound call or makes an outbound call, a ticket is automatically created in Zendesk Support. Agent status is automatically updated, but agents can also update their status manually. The wrap-up timer is automatic, but can also be adjusted manually.  
Transfer calls & collaborate with colleagues
Agents can transfer calls to other agents, queues, catalogues or specific phone numbers as required. To consult a colleague during a customer call, agents can simply type their name.  
Live Queue overviews
Managers can use the Puzzel Integration app to monitor queues and team availability. They can view the number of callers waiting, the number of agents available, busy and away, and calls offered and answered. Agents can also view their personal Puzzel data, such as the time they've spent logged in, the time they've used per pause type, and the call information for each of the queues they've been taking calls from. All the overviews automatically update the data every 15 seconds. However, you can also manually update an overview.  
About Puzzel
We are the leading European Contact Centre as a Service (CCaaS) provider. Our award-winning Customer Service Platform consists of three fully integrated, cloud-based solutions, including an omnichannel and AI-enabled Contact Centre, advanced email and Ticketing, and Workforce Management.

Automate incident management, troubleshoot faster, gain actionable insights, and improve reliability with EZOfficeInventory’s alerts in Zendesk. Check out our videos on Service Desk alerts and reports.
The systems interact seamlessly with each other, offering agents unprecedented levels of control and context when working on incidents. Access all your assets from EZOfficeInventory and link them with individuals and tickets within Zendesk.
Our integration with Zendesk enables you to: 

Search for assets, view asset information, and trigger tickets based on events such as overdue items and upcoming services in Zendesk
Create Zendesk tickets straight from the asset details page in EZOfficeInventory
Flag and quickly identify assets for maintenance, track an asset’s incident history, and identify and replace malfunctioning devices to proactively reduce ticket volume 

Some common use cases include:

An employee requests repairs for a broken laptop and reserves a loaner during the service. EZOfficeInventory manages asset-related details while Zendesk manages the ticket workflow. Alerts are generated at the expected date of service completion for outstanding tickets and overdue reservations. 
A technician in the field requires help troubleshooting a power drill and submits a ticket. In Zendesk, the agent immediately sees which drill is associated with the technician who submitted the ticket and follows up with specific details about the machine. 
An engineering company pulls a report in EZOfficeInventory showing all of the Zendesk tickets associated with their instruments, identifies malfunctioning items, and submits return merchandise authorizations before the warranties expire, reducing the volume of service tickets.

See our videos of other  common service management workflows..
Use EZOfficeInventory’s powerful asset tracking ability to track custody, location, and maintenance of all your assets. In addition, gain visibility into asset details via out-of-the-box integrations with identity management solutions such as Google Workspace, OneLogin, and Okta.

Git-Zen is a simple yet powerful GitHub integration application for Zendesk. Git-Zen coordinates your Zendesk tickets with your GitHub commits and issues. When a Zendesk ticket arrives, and code needs to be changed to correct the issue, you can now easily see which files needed to be changed to correct the issue right next to the ticket. Git-Zen makes it easy to look at past tickets and see exactly what code was changed to correct the issue, in case further troubleshooting is needed in the future. Git-Zen can also keep your agents separate from your developers, so that you do not need to have Zendesk licenses for your development staff; simply create a new GitHub issue related to the Zendesk ticket directly from within Zendesk.
Easy to Use
To associate a GitHub commit, all you have to do is include the Zendesk ticket number in the issue description or comment of the commit, prefaced by ""gz#"":
this is a comment for gz#12345

Functional
See a list of related issues, files, and commits right next to the ticket. Click on a commit link to view the commit in GitHub. Create a new GitHub issue, link an existing GitHub issue, and comment on a GitHub issue right from within the Zendesk ticket.
Flexible
Multiple tickets can be referenced in the same commit comment or issue. Multiple repositories can be referenced; so if a change was required to both your database schema and your web application, all of the changes will be listed together.
Affordable
Enjoy the full feature set for less than $20 a month (cost is per Zendesk domain account; Git-Zen offers an unlimited number of users with each account).

IMPORTANT: Git-Zen for GitLab is designed to work with GitLab.com, and  will not function with self-hosted instances of GitLab.
Git-Zen Lite is the FREE version of the simple yet powerful Git-Zen GitLab integration application for Zendesk. Git-Zen coordinates your Zendesk tickets with your GitLab commits. When a Zendesk ticket arrives, and code needs to be changed to correct the issue, you can now easily see which files needed to be changed to correct the issue right next to the ticket. Git-Zen makes it easy to look at past tickets and see exactly what code was changed to correct the issue, in case further troubleshooting is needed in the future. Git-Zen can also keep your agents separate from your developers, so that you do not need to have Zendesk licenses for your development staff.
Easy to Use
To associate a GitLab commit, all you have to do is include the Zendesk ticket number in the comment of the commit, prefaced by ""gz#"":
this is a comment for gz#12345

Informative
See a list of related issues, files, and commits right next to the ticket. Click on a commit link to view the commit in GitLab.
Flexible
Multiple tickets can be referenced in the same commit comment. Multiple repositories can be referenced; so if a change was required to both your database schema and your web application, all of the changes will be listed together.
Affordable
Use the LITE version for free, or enjoy the full feature set for less than $20 a month (cost is per Zendesk account; Git-Zen offers an unlimited number of users with each account).
Features
Git-Zen Lite includes the following features:

Reference ticket from a GitLab commit
View files affected by a referenced commit
Unlimited ticket references
Unlimited users
File and commit lists limited to 5 items each

The full version of Git-Zen (available from the Zendesk Marketplace) includes all of the features of the Git-Zen Lite, but also includes the following features:

Create a new GitLab issue directly from Zendesk
Link multiple existing GitLab issues to a ticket

Textline is a business text messaging platform that empowers sales teams to create more leads, respond instantly to prospects, and close deals faster.
Brands like 1-800-Got-Junk, Mathnasium, Stuart Weitzman, and Farmers Insurance use Textline to communicate with leads in a way that is fast, convenient, efficient, and accessible from anywhere. Increase lead conversion and speed up your sales cycle by engaging with SMS and adding a personal touch to your communication strategy.
Mobilize your pipeline, work as a team, and perfect your sales process
Your leads prefer texting and value quick responses. SMS has a higher response rate than phone calls or emails, and buyers often choose the vendor that responds first. Use Textline to follow up with leads, send reminders, schedule phone calls and demos, and more.
Textline offers the best tools to share information and collaborate as a team. Keep all of your contacts and a record of every customer conversation in one place while you monitor and analyze data to perfect your sales process and fine-tune your team’s sales workflow.
Our seamless integration lets you use Textline natively within Sell. Initiate and respond to text messages using the top bar widget or sidebar widget. Automatically log all text conversations in Sell as notes on Leads & Contacts or Deals, while the contacts are saved in Textline’s address book.
Features include:

Shortcuts — Store templates for frequently used messages.
Transfer — Transfer text messages, similar to transferring phone calls.
Notifications — Receive desktop, email, and mobile alerts.
Auto Responses — Use automated greetings and away messages.
Whispers — Leave private notes for internal team discussions.
Metrics — Understand customer interactions and monitor team performance.
MMS — Send and receive photos, videos, and attachments.

If you're new to Tymeshift, please install the Tymeshift for Zendesk Support app first, and then install this Chat app. While it’s a different app, it still keeps all of your data in one place.
Tymeshift is an omnichannel workforce management (WFM) tool that is made exclusively for Zendesk. With a quick setup and intuitive interface, Tymeshift helps customer support teams transparently manage their workforce to make agents more efficient and managers more engaged. To make life even easier, Tymeshift launched a Forecast feature that creates accurate predictions of future contact volumes and shows how many agents are needed to get everything done.
You get the chance to try Tymeshift out for free with a 10-day trial. After that, you can purchase licenses starting as low as $5/month each.
Key features:

Forecast: predict your future contact volumes across all channels and know how many agents you'll need. You can even adjust volumes and staffing parameters to match your plans.
Time & attendance: automatically track time spent on Zendesk tickets, chats, and calls. Track your agents Zendesk Talk states and create custom AUX states for lunch, breaks, and other activities.
Real-time monitoring: learn what your entire team of agents is doing in real time and across all channels.
Occupancy & utilization: know if your agents are focusing on the tasks they should be working on or if you need to make adjustments.
Scheduling: fast and easy! You can create complete intraday schedules and view staffing across all channels. Even better - agents can view their schedule without ever leaving Zendesk.
Schedule adherence: understand how well your agents are adhering to their schedules by overlaying their actual vs. expected schedule or by getting a percentage score.
Agent scorecards: transparency boosts productivity! Make custom scorecards for your agents with the metrics that matter to your organization.
Notifications: configure custom rules and get alerted when things are going awry. Notify team leads at their emails, chrome or Slack, when an agent logs in late or if they’re in an idle state for too long.


We're proud to help our customers tackle their WFM challenges!

4 Key Use Cases -  Zendesk integrations and automations
Want to know what you can accomplish with Zendesk and Workato? Here are some of the ways you can use Zendesk integrations to manage and automate workflows across your organization.
Shorten your ticket resolution time
It takes most businesses more than 72 hours to resolve a support ticket, an average resolution time that frustrates customers and can lead them to look for more reliable options. An integrated system helps your business share new tickets between teams for faster ticket resolution times.

Connect customers with someone who can help – on the first try. Integrate Zendesk with other ticketing systems, like Jira and ServiceNow, to automatically route incidents to the right team or to effortlessly move tickets between teams with cross-system escalation.
Help team leaders prioritize and manage tickets. Set up custom integrations that help team leaders mobilize their teams to resolve time-sensitive issues as fast as possible – without migrating tickets manually and without needing to login to a new platform.
Use notifications to alert sales and support to ticket changes. Let your team know about new tickets and updates to existing tickets by connecting Zendesk and Microsoft Teams or Slack. This integration keeps your team in the loop on the apps they use most. It also lets employees see, transfer, and approve tickets without switching between apps.

Provide a unified helpdesk
A unified helpdesk makes it easier for your business to bring employees together to resolve tickets. Plus, it gives you a 360-degree view of the end-to-end customer support experience, a perspective that helps your business streamline workflows and allocate resources effectively.

Sync support across channels. Integrate Zendesk with CRMs like Salesforce, SAP, or Microsoft Dynamics to provide centralized access to support tickets and sales inquiries. Sync these platforms to bring order, loyalty, and communication history together.
Manage product returns. Authorize and process product returns and refunds by integrating Zendesk with inventory management software like Quickbooks or Evernote. This integration helps ensure that orders and returns end up where they need to be.

Successfully onboard and offboard employees
An effective onboarding process helps new employees become more productive – and it can improve employee retention in the long run. Smooth out the wrinkles in your onboarding process by integrating Zendesk (where you create and manage onboarding tickets) with your HRMs.

Create, assign, and resolve onboarding tickets without switching platforms. Sync Zendesk with platforms like Workday to share onboarding tasks (like creating credentials or provisions for a new employee) across platforms. With this integration, you can also automatically open and close child tickets based on actions people take in other apps.
Give employees access to human resources through Zendesk. An integration can open up a line of communication between your employees and your human resource team. Help your employees browse and search knowledge bases, create incident tickets, and access their human resource files without leaving a familiar platform.

Integrate product data to prevent churn
Often customers don’t even try to resolve an issue and give up on the product. Proactively monitor product and usage data from various systems to engage with customers who may be slipping away.

Automatically create tickets based on SaaS product usage data. Monitor data from systems like Snowflake, Amazon S3, Redshift, or Mixpanel, Amplitude and Pendo, and based on a condition, create a ticket in Zendesk. For instance, if the product usage data is declining by more than 30% compared to the previous month, automatically create a ticket.
Notify the relevant people to take action. Once the ticket is created, you can set an automation to look up who the account executive, sales engineer and/or relationship managers are on Zendesk or Salesforce to notify them on Slack or any other communication platform.",1,5,Automate workflows and integrate data between 1500+ apps using no code at all,Free,Workato,Automate workflows and integrate data between 1500+ apps using no code at all,Ticketing System,,mailto:support@workato.com,https://www.workato.com/,https://www.zendesk.com/apps/support/70000/workato/

The Deadline app allows you to set a date and time on a ticket for when something needs to happen.
Since launching this app in 2016, we've processed over a million deadlines, with some customers creating many thousands of deadlines week in week out.
Setting a deadline on a ticket:

At the point a deadline hits, you can define what you want to happen to the ticket using triggers. If you need to change the priority, ticket status or any other ticket field, that's not a problem! If you want to notify the assignee, assigned group or even the requestor, this is all doable.
When the deadline hits, the assignee will also see an optional popup notification at the top right in Zendesk.
An example of how notifications work and how the ticket details can be set to change when a deadline is reached:

The in-app 'workflows' functionality allows you to set things to happen relative to a deadline. Maybe you need to be reminded 1 hour before a deadline hits? No problem! 
In addition to being able to perform any ticket action at, before or after a deadline, those actions can be dependent on ticket conditions. For example, if a deadline hit on a ticket, 24 hours passed and the ticket was not yet solved, you could set it to escalate the ticket's priority to urgent and notify the assigned team by email telling them to take action.
The deadline app stores the time on hidden ticket fields in Zendesk. This allows you to create views, macros and reports using native Zendesk functionality.
Example of how you can reference a deadline using a macro:

Features

Set an exact time on a ticket.
Define custom ticket actions or notifications to take place at the time.
Popup notification for assignee when the deadline hits.
Workflows allow actions & notifications relative to when a deadline is set.
Automatic timezone handling so agents always see deadlines relative to their perspective.

With their heads down answering tickets and focusing on customers, it can be tough for agents to see how things going and make decisions about where they should spend their time. Geckoboard helps you surface important support metrics like unassigned tickets, new and solved tickets so far today, CSAT, first response time, full resolution time, SLAs breached, SLAs achieved, top ticket solvers and more, so agents can decide what to focus on, and own their work without you needing to micromanage.
Prevent problems
Issues can often go unnoticed, but by surfacing real time metrics with Geckoboard, you and your team can see exactly how busy things are at any given time, spot bottlenecks, and prevent problems before they get out of hand. You can even bring metrics in from other tools including Zendesk Talk and Chat, for a top-down, omnichannel view of what's going on across all your support channels.
Stay energized
Highlighting your star agents on your dashboard is a great way to energize the team! With a bit of friendly competition, the whole team is inspired to raise the bar and lets them celebrate their successes.
Feel valued
Customer support teams often have their hard work overlooked, and deserve more recognition than they get. Sharing your dashboards or displaying them on a large screen in your workplace is a great way to shine a light on the whole team’s contribution to the business.
""We always optimize where we can. Geckoboard helps us work better, faster and happier without having to add people to the team."" - Cory Archer, Director of Support, Databank
""Having a top-down view gives individuals the ability to easily switch focus to where it’s needed most."" - Joey Wheeler, Director of Client Services, Autoloop
""Agents love it because they can see everything they need in one place. The rest of the company love it too because they simply didn't know what was going on in the Customer Care team before we shared our dashboards. It opens people's eyes to see that the team works so hard and gives visibility to the work they do throughout the organisation."" - Logan Grooms, Director of Customer Care, Maisonettep

ScreenSteps combines everything you need to organize screenshots, mark them up, add titles and text, and then publish right to Zendesk Help Center or the Legacy Web Portal.
Improve your self-service by giving your customers great answers that are crystal clear. Instead of using only text to explain how to use your software, you can incorporate multiple screenshots into an article to show your customers exactly what to do, walking them through each step of a process.
Collaborate with a team of agents, and get everybody to contribute their knowledge. Because ScreenSteps is so simple to use, anybody on your team can create great tutorials. You can also use presets so that your documentation looks consistent no matter who writes it. And because writing great documentation in ScreenSteps is so quick, everybody on your team will be able to write a lot more of it.
Reduce support requests. Zendesk customers who use ScreenSteps to create high quality articles notice a drop in tickets submitted because customers can find what they need on their own, and they have fewer follow up questions asking for points of clarification.
Update screenshots so your customers always have the most relevant information right at their fingertips. All you have to do is click the “Replace image” button and you can instantly replace an old screenshot with a current one that shows off your software’s new UI. ScreenSteps also makes it easy to assign outdated articles to members of your team so you can divide and conquer.
Rollback old revisions - pretty helpful if you or a member of your team makes a mistake and you need to reload an older version of your article. ScreenSteps stores all of your images so you can revert to a previous copy.
Resolve tickets faster by sending your customers a link to your articles. No more repeating the same thing again and again, or having to clarify what your macro said in follow-up emails. You can show your customers exactly what you mean using marked up screenshots, and walk them through complex workflows by showing them what to do.

It's so easy to make a mistake and add an incorrect person to copy. Boom! Your customer's confidential data is shared with third parties. The app allows to take it under control and reduce risks.

Three steps to reduce risks:

Step 1. Restrict who can add CC or followers. Allow adding CC only to those who really need it.
Step 2. Restrict who can be added as a CC or followers. It can be people from the requester`s organization domain, your company domain, or another domain you specified.
Step 3. Set the level of control suitable for your workflow. The app restricts adding a disallowed person or just warns the agent.
And the last. An agent can accidentally remove an important person from CC. Restrict who can remove CC or followers added by others and be sure that persons who should be notified are.

Security and privacy
The app runs in the Zendesk agent interface and does not transmit your customers' data anywhere else. So using the app you are still complying with all the security and privacy Zendesk complies with.

Alert Wrong User app allows you to alert or prevent your agents from making requester and assignee changes into specific names or email domains. Example use cases: 

Prevent agents from transferring tickets inside Zendesk to wrong internal teams. 
Alert agents from erroneously changing requester emails to incorrect domains (e.g. from *@gmail.com to *@gmal.com) 
Alert agents when tickets are transferred to a specific team member (e.g. shift supervisor). * And many more. 

Working in dynamic Zendesk environment often brings unwanted mistakes from your Agents. Both small and large multi-tiered teams can be affected by actions from a single agent. Large organizations are especially affected with daily ticket changes between teams in Zendesk, often decreasing customer experience due to erroneous transfer. Alert Wrong User app provides more control of where and to whom customer tickets are being assigned to, or how requester changes occur. By using js regex inside the app editor, you can:

Specify email domains to which assignees or requesters can't be changed.
Specify names to which assignees or requesters can't be changed.
Alert agents of assignee or requester changes, or completely prevent them.
Customize text inside alerts seen by agents.
Use different language variants in your alerts.

To request help from another agent in your Zendesk account, click on the app’s Ask for help button when viewing an existing ticket.  Select the agents that you would like to notify and enter a message describing the type of assistance that you need.
View requests
Whenever an agent requests assistance from you, a notification will appear in your notification list.  These are displayed within the Top Bar in Zendesk Support.  Click on a notification to be redirected to the associated ticket.
Action a request
Once you’ve viewed the ticket and the agent’s help request message (which is displayed in the ticket sidebar), you can decide whether or not you’re able to help.  Let the agent know either in person or by updating the ticket (perhaps with an Internal Note).  If you don’t want to be notified about this request anymore, you can remove yourself from the request by clicking on the Remove button next to your name.
As the agent that submitted the help request, you can withdraw or resolve the ticket at any time by clicking on the corresponding buttons in the app.  If all notified agents are removed from a help request, it can be withdrawn by anyone.  Whenever a help request is withdrawn or resolved, an Internal Note is added to the ticket recording the date, time and person that closed the request and all agent notifications are removed.

Miralix Contact Center integration for Zendesk
Miralix ContactCenter integration for Zendesk can be used by companies, who combine the use of Zendesk with receiving and handling calls through Miralix’ ContactCenter solution.
The integration works by setting up automatic processes in Miralix ContactCenter, which makes it faster to handle customer contact and give great service – thus benefitting both the company using the integration as well as the end-users.
When a ContactCenter agent or Switchboard operator is offered a call, Miralix ContactCenter integration for Zendesk can look up tickets connected to the caller’s phone number or create a new ticket with a caller’s phone number. You decide if the integration should do this automatically or if you prefer it to be a manual task – it depends on your configuration.
You can even combine the two options, so the integration automatically looks up the caller and gives you the chance to create a ticket manually.
Through Miralix, you can also import data from a call to Zendesk. For instance, you can import which Miralix queue the call was received through if you use a statistic/analytic integration to Zendesk and need statistical data about each of your tickets.
As part of the option to create a ticket, Miralix’ ContactCenter integration for Zendesk makes it possible to change the text in the ticket. This way you can have different tickets for different departments. Furthermore, it gives you the option of adding comments.
Once the ticket has been created, it can be assigned to an agent or a group of agents with a Zendesk license.
Miralix Contact Center integration for Zendesk looks up the end-user’s phone number in Zendesk and Miralix. If the phone number is registered in both Zendesk and Miralix, the integration will only use the end-user information from Zendesk.
For the integration to work, you need a Miralix ContactCenter solution and a User Access License, as well as either a Miralix Attendant Console license or an OfficeClient Agent license.
About Miralix
The integration was developed by Miralix, which offers intelligent customer contact management and has +23 years of experience with dedicated, operator-independent ContactCenter solutions.

Respira Tag Files is a small app that will add tags with the file extensions of the attachments found in your tickets.
For example, if there is a .jpg file in a ticket, a ""ri_jpg"" and a ""hasattachments"" tag will be added to your ticket. Then you can use those tags to create views, trigger events, automate actions, etc.
A typical use case is sending an automated email to a customer if she forgot to upload a photo when opening the ticket, asking her to upload it. You may also want an agent to review the documents your users are uploading so they can be marked as reviewed.
To do its job, this app uses the Zendesk API. That´s why you need to enter your credentials.
The process
The process is very simple:

Every 5 minutes, we look for new tickets with status <= pending
If a new ticket is found, a ""processed"" label is added, so the ticket will not be processed again.
If no attachments are found, a ""noattachments"" label is added
If there is an attachment or more, a ""hasattachments"" label is added
For every different file extension in the ticket attachments, an ""ri_ + file_extension"" label is added.

The Better Views app for Zendesk makes it possible for you to organize your Views even more than the default Views setting within Zendesk Support. With Better Views, you can:
* Organize your Views in a tree structure
* Get an unlimited amount of Views displayed
With the Better Views app, you can get a more structured display of views, and therefore also a better overview - hence “Better Views”.
Core features
To illustrate how Better Views for Zendesk can help you achieve a better overview of your tickets, we’ve made a few points with the app’s core features below.
Organize your views in a tree structure
With this app, you can organize your Views in a tree structure instead of a linear structure. This way you are able to arrange your structure into relations between the views.
For instance, if you want to divide your tickets into SoMe types. Instead of having 4 different views, like this:

Facebook
Instagram
Twitter
LinkedIn

It could look like this:

Social Media


Facebook
Instagram
Twitter
LinkedIn


Or if you have several brands with several countries supported in your Zendesk it could look like this:

Brand 1


Denmark
Germany


Get an unlimited number of views
In the default Zendesk Support solution there is a limit to how many views can be displayed: 12 of your shared views and 8 of your personal views.
With the Better Views app for Zendesk Support, you’re able to get an unlimited amount of views displayed and therefore you don’t need to select which ones are the most important ones.
Community
We want to make sure you’re fully satisfied and just as pleased with this app as we are. So, if you’re missing a feature or think something could be changed for the better, just head over to our community and let us know.

Monitor and report on list progress across multiple tickets

Tickler gives you the ability to create and use checklists within Zendesk. Tickler also allows you to build powerful workflows through automatically activated lists and the triggering of business rules.
Tickler is an upgrade for all previous Tickler apps. It includes all the features from the earlier apps, including support for three different styles of lists: ad-hoc lists from Tickler FREE and PLUS, saved lists from Tickler PLUS, and automatic tag-based lists from Tickler PRO. 
Ad-hoc lists as the name implies, can be created and edited on the fly. Agents can add, edit, reorder and remove tasks without needing any special permissions or rights. Ad-hoc lists are flexible and unstructured. This allows agents to easily customize the list as the situation dictates.
Saved lists being as ad-hoc lists that then saved, so they can be easily reused on similar tickets. Saved lists can also be appended to an ad-hoc list, if there's already one on a ticket. Agents can save lists to their profile, which they can manage from the app. Admins can also save shared lists, which are available to all agents with access to Tickler. Saved lists also come with features not available with regular ad-hoc lists. For example, saved lists can be marked as 'uneditable', so agents can only update the status of tasks. You can also prevent a ticket from being solved until the list is complete. 
Automatic lists (also known as tag-based lists) are much more powerful. Each automatic list is associated with either a tag or a combination of tags. When those tags are present on a ticket, the list is activated automatically without any action needed from the agent. Tags are what makes these lists so powerful. Anything that can update tags on a ticket can be used to activate or deactivate a checklist. For example, you can use tag-based custom ticket fields (i.e., checklist, dropdown, or tagger fields). You could also use a macro or trigger to activate a checklist. With tag-based lists, you're not limited to the number of lists that can appear on a ticket.
Individual tasks are also more powerful with automatic lists. Agents can add comments. Admins can configure tasks to perform actions when it's status changes. For example, running a macro or updating a ticket field. Task descriptions also support HTML, which makes it possible to highlight words or phrases in the description, or even add links. 
Both types of lists can be output in a print-friendly format or easily be inserted into a ticket comment. Tickler allows you to sync list data and progress to other ticket fields as well. This allows you can make checklist data available to end-users, within Guide.
For info on how to configure and use Tickler, please refer to the Tickler User Guide.

Telerivet is an instant text messaging platform for organizations anywhere in the world.
Telerivet makes it easy to seamlessly integrate text messaging with your Zendesk Support account. Your end-users can send support requests via SMS to a local phone number, which will appear as tickets in your Zendesk Support account. When your Zendesk Support agents reply, the replies will be sent as SMS messages from the same phone number.
Unlike other text messaging integrations, Telerivet is not limited to particular countries. Telerivet supports multiple options for sending and receiving SMS:
Android Phone:  You can connect any Android phone to Telerivet, allowing you to use a local phone number in your country to receive SMS messages and send replies. When the Android phone receives an SMS message, the Telerivet Gateway app will forward the message to Telerivet's servers and then to your Zendesk account. When a Zendesk Support agent replies, the Telerivet Gateway app will send the message from your Android phone. Learn more
Virtual Numbers: Telerivet can connect to any SMS gateway API that provides virtual numbers, including international providers such as Twilio.  You can connect your own account from a third-party provider to get the best SMS rates. (Virtual numbers are only available in certain countries.) Learn more
SMS Shortcodes: If you get an SMS shortcode from a mobile network, Telerivet can integrate directly with the mobile networks, so that incoming messages are forwarded to your Zendesk Support account, and your Zendesk Support agents can send replies from your shortcode. Learn more
In addition to SMS, Telerivet also supports sending and receiving multimedia messages (MMS), as well as WhatsApp messages.
Telerivet also provides a full-featured web application that lets you manage your organization's SMS messaging from your browser. From the Telerivet web dashboard, you can manage contacts, send broadcasts, and create automated messaging services, including polls, subscriptions, and auto-replies. Learn more

Data Integration is the transferring of data between storage types, formats, or computer systems. It is required when organizations or individuals change systems or upgrade to new systems, or one company acquires another and there is a need for translating data from one format to another. Data Integration does not mean just copying the data (data movement), but actually is the process that also includes the validation, transformation and cleansing of data to ensure that the data being migrated is correct and in a format for use by an application.

Data Integration involves the restructuring of data in some way; this may mean fields being merged, or formats being changed, or the data being transformed in various other ways. It is the process by which company transforms the legacy data into its standards, using standardization and business translational logic. Data Migration can be a one-time or recurring event used to update from one system to another.

Process Integration: Typical use case is orchestrating an end to end process across multiple applications or endpoints such as the quote to cash process across a CRM solution like Microsoft Dynamics CRM with a Backend Financials or ERP application. The end user does may or may not have access to these systems, but key account data such as Invoice order history and payment status may be regularly updated so that the CRM user has a complete​ view of the account. Another use case may be the creation of an order in the CRM via an opportunity record. Once an opportunity is Closed Won, they system can trigger and event that passes the relevant information into the order entry system. Subsequently the Order Entry system may return the Order Number and status information related to the recently won opportunity.
Real-time API Management: Harmony Live! allows non-technical users to design, deploy and manage end-to-end, real-time APIs without writing a single line of code. The Jitterbit Studio is a graphical point and click configuration tool that includes wizard-based connectors for the most popular enterprise apps and connectivity to hundreds of systems.

Mindsay's integration with Zendesk allows two types of agent handover depending on specific business rules:

Create a ticket in Zendesk: the bot prequalifies your customer's needs and gathers information through the conversation to be sent in a ticket,
Chat handover in Zendesk: on the customer's request or if the customer's question is out of the bot's skills, the history of the conversation is sent to Zendesk Chat and an agent is alerted to take over the conversation.

Functionality 
The agent can see the products logged against this user. They have quite a few cameras and product extensions (e.g tripods, batteries, lenses etc). The agent even has the possibility to access the User manual to check for product features that clients are having trouble with. The search feature is a very powerful addition to the Zendesk Sunshine data base as agents can quickly search by product name or serial number to offer contextual assistance.  Agents can also follow the other tickets that the client has logged in and easily navigate through them. 
Add an asset 
Ability for the agent to easily add a product that the client has bought but maybe not registered yet. The data is stored inside Zendesk. If your systems communicate seamlessly with Zendesk, the data introduced by the agent can instantly become available across all platforms. Hence the sales people will also know this information which might be useful in making the next sales recommending to the client. The agent can fill in the relevant data for the product that the client provides. They can add a serial number and a user manual.

Track orders 
See what orders the client has with you along with their complete history. See status of orders, order details, payment details, complete with an order management tool and a way to sync the data directly in Zendesk for reporting purposes. Browse and search features included.

A means for agents to extend management capabilities of client orders. With this modal, agents can: 

Track an order directly and see where it ended up 
Create a return label should the client want to return their order 
Ask for a refund 

The above actions are all connected to external services. Those actions don’t have any effect in Zendesk. The reason they’re there is to keep as much much functionality onto one platform and not have your team navigate between different systems as this is bound to create human error. 
Add to Zendesk 
Sync the data brought into Zendesk via the API with internal fields (user fields, organisational fields and ticket fields). This will help you create better reports and have your data live into one system. 
Recently viewed articles 
These are the articles that the user has last viewed. Imagine how much context an agent has when answering an inquiry if they even know what the user did in the Knowledge Base in Guide. The agent can pass relevant articles that the client has not had the patience to either find on their own or were not that visible. Not to mention how you can even set some articles to promoted based on what users browse and find answers to. The user has to be logged into the Guide for to be able to retrieve this data. 
Make it your own! 
Every system is different so depending on your framework or the technical stack of your product, you will need help in connecting the two systems which can be done either directly or via a web service.

As Zendesk explains on the Zendesk Guide landingpage:

A knowledge base is a crucial part of any company’s customer experience strategy. 
It organizes frequently asked questions, product details, policies, and more, and empowers 
customers and agents with that information. 
Integrated seamlessly with Zendesk Support,  Zendesk Guide is a smart knowledge base. It’s built to help you and your team  continuously improve your content, keep it up to date, and serve it to customers.

Why Newsfeed
Your agents live inside of Zendesk Support. They use it to handle Chats, Social Messaging, calls and tickets.
Thanks to Sunshine and Customer Profiles and Events they get a 360 view of your customer interactions.
But how are they kept up to date about new Help Center articles? Do you want them to keep the Help Center open in a second tab or on a second screen all day?
Introducing Newsfeed
The Newsfeed app shows the 5 most recent articles of your Help Center right next to any ticket, and highlights articles updated or created today.
That way, no matter which ticket your agents are handling, they will see up to date information right inside of Zendesk Support
Features

Show the 5 most recently updated articles
Filter by category or section
Highlights articles updated today
Integrated in the Zendesk interface without annoying popups or alerts.

Schedule events visually and with minimal effort. Quickly create a new ticket with an event or add an event to an existing ticket by simply dragging out an event on a calendar.
Creating an event in Zendesk:

Leverage the power of Zendesk views, triggers, macros, etc, to create powerful communication or escalation workflows around your events, while at the same time improving the visibility of when things are happening across your teams.
If you use Google Calendar or Office 365 within your organization, you're in luck: we have full-featured integrations with both. This means that when scheduling events, you'll be able to avoid overlap with any existing events that may have been scheduled already outside of Zendesk. It also means that should any changes be made to ticket events in Google or Office 365, that those changes will reflect back onto the ticket. 
""Swivel chairing"" between Zendesk, Office 365 and Google Calendar is now a thing of the past.
How events sync up with Google Calendar:

Create as many calendars as you need. Compare any or all of them within Zendesk to ensure you're scheduling events at the best time. 
Comparing events across multiple calendars:

Specify permissions so only specific users, groups and/or roles can see calendars and control who can create and modify events in them.
Features:

Create any number of organization-wide calendars
Agents can create any number of personal calendars
Granular calendar read and write permissions based on any combination of roles, groups or specific users
Monthly, weekly and daily calendar views
Calendar view where you can toggle any calendar on or off
Uses ticket fields for data such as event date and time, so you can use these in macros, views and triggers
Setup workflows using triggers or automations at any time before or after event start or end times, eg: notify the assignee a day before the event starts
Google Calendar integration
Office 365 Calendar integration
Map ticket data to the Office 365 or Google Calendar event description or location using liquid markup placeholders
Integrations are bi-directional: changes made to events in Office 365 or Google are near-instantly reflected back on the ticket
Show events from Office 365 or Google within Zendesk, so you can schedule ticket events around them
Optionally hide the full event details from Office 365 or Google and just show busy times
Automatic timezone handling, or if needed, an option for the agent to control the timezone.

Please visit this page to see all of the requirements and recommendations for installing RedminePro before subscribing!
Please note that you are required to install a plugin into your Redmine instance in order for this app to work. Please see the plugin (freely available here) to see what is involved. It is a simple installation, but requires server access.
In addition, your Redmine service needs to be accessible via SSL (i.e. using https). This is a requirement based on the fact that RedminePro uses the Zendesk proxy to access your instance to retrieve information and add tickets. In addition, the certificate should have a valid signing chain and should not be a self-signed certificate. You will also need to ensure that the API is enabled in the Administration pages.
For the best experience, you should also add the better custom fields plugin to your Redmine installation. To get it go to our github page.
Contact us at support@smallcubed.com if you would like to obtain a coupon to try RedminePro one month for free.
Be sure that the user you use for the main API key is an administrative user to ensure that all data can be retrieved. We recommend creating a separate user for the Zendesk interactions.

Send mass outbound emails directly from Zendesk;
Streamline the way you send follow-ups;
Deliver better customer service by reaching out to customers at right times.

Proactive Campaigns is an add-on for Zendesk Support that enables you to quickly and easily send out mass emails to targeted lists of customers. Save precious time and let the system reach out to your customers automatically.
Now, let’s see what else is possible with Proactive Campaigns:
Customer lists
Choose one or multiple criteria to filter the customer database and create your list. You can use tags, custom, and standard fields to filter the right users and group them together.

Ticket lists
In a similar way, segment tickets by chosen criteria and send out personalized email campaigns to customers in chosen tickets.

Bulk ticket creation
Once you’ve built and launched the campaign, Proactive Campaigns will automatically start raising tickets on customers’ behalf and deliver them as emails.
Automatic response tracking
Replies from your customers will be automatically picked up by Zendesk. No scattered or lost data! All information is kept in one place.
Contact list sharing
Make your lists public to share them with other agents across the subdomain. No need to create a list with the same criteria to send a different message.
Running campaigns in the background
Run a few campaigns simultaneously without the need to keep a tab or a browser open. Go about your day while Proactive Campaigns is sending emails.
Scheduling
Set a specific time and date for your campaigns. That way, you will never forget to send out an important update.

Custom ticket assignment
Easily select who needs to be put in charge of all the tickets created during the campaign. You may assign tickets to another agent, group, or pick one of your brands to be in charge of the whole campaign tickets.
CSV user import
Want to save even more time? Import a specific list of contacts into the plugin right when you are creating a campaign. And to make sure the relations between your contacts’ info are preserved, there is a field mapping feature during the process of user import.

Email formatting
To make your emails more memorable, add virtually any formatting to your email body with the WYSIWYG Editor. Moreover, you can upload attachments up to 40 MB in size to any of your emails.

Git-Zen is a simple yet powerful Azure DevOps integration application for Zendesk. Git-Zen coordinates your Zendesk tickets with your Azure DevOps commits and work items. When a Zendesk ticket arrives, and code needs to be changed to correct the issue, you can now easily see which commits were made to correct the issue right next to the ticket. Git-Zen makes it easy to look at past tickets and see exactly what code was changed to correct the issue, in case further troubleshooting is needed in the future. Git-Zen can also keep your agents separate from your developers, so that you do not need to have Zendesk licenses for your development staff; simply create a new Azure DevOps work item related to the Zendesk ticket directly from within Zendesk.
Easy to Use
To associate a Azure DevOps commit, all you have to do is include the Zendesk ticket number in the issue description or comment of the commit, prefaced by ""gz#"":
this is a comment for gz#12345

Functional
See a list of related work items and commits right next to the ticket. Click on a commit link to view the commit in Azure DevOps. Create a new work item, link an existing work item, and comment on a work item right from within the Zendesk ticket.
Flexible
Multiple tickets can be referenced in the same commit comment or work item. Multiple repositories can be referenced; so if a change was required to both your database schema and your web application, all of the changes will be listed together.
Affordable
Enjoy the full feature set for less than $20 a month (cost is per Zendesk domain account; Git-Zen offers an unlimited number of users with each account).
Free Trial Available
Contact us at support@git-zen for more information.

Unlimited ticket references
Unlimited users
Unlimited commit, and work item lists

""This app is fantastic! It’s empowered us with NPS reporting that we needed for delivering a better customer experience."" -- Judd Manley-Breen, General Manager - Operations & IT, Star21
Instead of asking requesters to rate each ticket with a question where the options are limited to 'good' or 'bad', the Survey app allows you to ask your requester to rate agent performance with a 0-10 rating instead. 
You're also able to ask the requester a second NPS® question where they can rate your organization from 0-10. 
The 0-10 responses allow you to gather data about how your support team and organization are doing in much higher fidelity than the native CSAT surveys.
Surveys can be branded with your logo, colour and domain mapping. 
Answering an example survey:

Once a survey has been responded to, from an agents perspective in Zendesk, they'll be able to see the results on the right of the ticket. 
One option within the app is to convert the 0-10 response of the first question into a satisfaction score. This means that if you have existing CSAT reports setup, you'll be able to continue using them, in addition to the new data recorded by the app. 
What an agent sees on a ticket after a survey is responded to:

At the point a survey is responded, a tag corresponding the scores given will be added to the ticket. This allows you to build workflows using Zendesk triggers in order to escalate tickets with bad scores or highlight the ones with great scores.
Data recorded by the survey app is easily digestible with drillable in-app reports and an ability to view a full history of responses.

Features

Personal data is disorganized, hard to spot, and stored across many systems. That makes offering data rights—like deleting your data—very hard for companies. Transcend automatically fulfills data subject requests inside companies, across all of their data systems and vendors. Transcend also provides their end-users with a control panel, or “Privacy Center”, hosted at privacy.company.com where users can manage their privacy preferences, export their data, or delete it. By making data subject requests painless for companies, Transcend is putting users everywhere in the driver’s seat of their personal data.
We make it easy to stay compliant while supporting your customers with Zendesk. Here’s how:
Automatically fulfill data privacy requests from your users in Zendesk
Respond to access and erasure data privacy requests from your end-users in seconds, going beyond standard compliance to breakthrough user experiences.
Zero trust security
Transcend integrates with Zendesk through a secure gateway. The gateway integrates with your existing key management systems so that your organization’s secrets and data are kept safe, and Transcend never sees them.

Fix manual internal processes, ultimately conserving valuable legal and engineering resources and ensuring your privacy program can scale with increasing user demand.",,,Transcend automates privacy requests by orchestrating customer data in Zendesk,Free,Transcend,Transcend automates privacy requests by orchestrating customer data in Zendesk,Ticketing System,,mailto:partnerships@transcend.io,https://www.transcend.io/,https://www.zendesk.com/apps/support/387078/transcend/
